                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.       The effectiveness of public service delivery depends in large part on the capability,
resources and inputs, and the motivation of frontline service providers at the local level. In Nepal
a combination of de-concentrated line agencies and local bodies at the district, municipal, and village
level provides inputs which are translated into delivery of service outputs and outcomes. Yet the
relationships between line agencies and local bodies in service delivery are not well understood. This
study seeks to map out the dynamics of service delivery at the local level through analysis of the
institutional framework and actual practices in service delivery in 14 jurisdictions in the two districts
of Dhankuta and Dhanusa. The study includes a detailed review of the provision of local roads
networks and primary and lower secondary education.

Institutional Framework for Local Bodies

2.       Nepal’s approach to local government has historically emphasized local participation
and empowerment rather than creating institutions for service delivery. Over 50 years of sub-
national governance reforms have yielded an administrative framework of local bodies (LBs)
consisting of 75 District Development Committees (DDCs), 58 Municipalities and 3,915 Village
Development Committees (VDCs). As the LBs’ names indicate, their primary role is ‘development’,
understood as carrying out small capital works, rather than local governments ensuring a mix of inputs
for effective delivery of public services.

3.       LBs presently are run by centrally appointed civil servants. Elected local body councils
ceased to operate in 2002, at the height of Nepal’s internal conflict. For the past 12 years seconded
civil servants have been responsible for the day-to-day management of LBs, working with unelected
councils consisting of representatives from line departments and other local stakeholders. For a short
period LBs were required to consult with local representatives of political parties, but this practice was
halted after allegations of corruption. Senior LB officers are seconded by the Ministry of Federal
Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD), the central agency responsible for decentralization and
local development issues.

4.       LBs’ revenues have increased six-fold over the past six years without a corresponding
overhaul of their institutional framework. In contrast to other South Asian countries, Nepal’s LBs
account for a significant proportion of total public expenditure. Central government grants and
transfers to them have accounted for 9 to 12% of total central government expenditures from FY
2009/10 to FY 2012/13.

5.      Coherence in legislation regarding functional assignments could be strengthened. The
1999 Local Self Government Act (LSGA) assigns a wide range of functions including broad
responsibilities in the education, roads, water, health, agriculture and other sectors. There is overlap
between district and primary level VDC and municipality functions. Most important, the LSGA is not
aligned with other Government legislation, particularly the Government of Nepal (Allocation of
Business) Rules (2008, amended in 2009). The list of functions is thus a permitted list, rather than
mandated responsibilities. LBs’ functional responsibilities effectively follow a principle of
‘supplementarity’ to those of line agencies, rather than subsidiarity whereby responsibilities are
assigned to the lowest level with sufficient capability.

6.       Local spending patterns in Dhankuta and Dhanusa show LB involvement in a wide
range of sectors. LBs in practice fulfil functions where there is no other entity involved – essentially
vital events registration – or for which they receive earmarked grants, such as disbursements of social
benefits. In addition to spending on core administration and projects dictated by earmarked grants,
LBs fund small projects in a wide range of functional areas, including those which are not indicated in
the LSGA, such as the police.

7.      LB revenues are dominated by intergovernmental transfers. Own source revenues (OSR)
account for a small and diminishing share of total LB revenues, dropping from 17.5% in FY 2006/07
                                                    vi
 
 


to 13% in FY 2012/13. LB taxes are mostly nuisance taxes with limitations on setting rates and the tax
base. At the same time there has been a six-fold increase in the size of intergovernmental fiscal
transfers from FY 2006/7 to 2012/13, driven in part by an even larger eight-fold increase in transfers
for social payments for the same period. Overall, the share of transfers in LBs’ budgets has increased
from 60% to 83% in the same period. Transfers range from mostly discretionary block grants to
strictly earmarked transfers for social security and capital projects. VDCs and municipalities enjoy
substantial discretion over roughly 50% of their total revenues; DDCs, on the other hand, are much
more dependent on conditional grants, over which they have limited discretion.

8.      Planning for the use of LB resources is empowering to local communities but the process
does not facilitate cohesive planning for service delivery. LBs prepare five-year periodic plans
which are to inform annual plans and budgets. Annual LB planning involves a bottom-up, fourteen-
step process which is often not fully observed. The process has yielded significant involvement at the
grassroots level, with 40% of LB financed projects originating via local Ward Citizen Forums, though
there is indication of substantial influence on decision-making by local elites. Most importantly,
decision-making is rarely informed by technical assessments or a holistic analysis of service needs.
The LB planning cycle is not aligned with the national and deconcentrated line agency planning cycle;
linkages between the two processes are ad hoc.

9.      The LB planning process and method of executing projects reflects a priority on widely
spreading resources. In Dhanusa and Dhankuta VDCs and municipalities annually fund dozens of
small projects averaging as little as NPR 100,000 (US$ 1,000). DDCs have the same spending
patterns, only for an even greater number of projects of somewhat higher value. Execution of projects
overwhelmingly occurs via User Committees (UCs) which are to be formed among beneficiaries of the
proposed project and may receive funding directly for projects up to NPR 6 million.

10.     LB financial management practices could be reviewed to improve the coherence of
spending on sectors and accountability. Although there are required formats, there is wide variance
among actual LB financial reports. Reporting on expenditure is organized according to revenue source
devoted to that expenditure; this leads to unusual expenditure items appearing in financial reports,
such as ‘land registration fees’. The breakdown by revenue source indicates that multiple revenue
sources are not used for the same expenditure item. There is no breakdown of expenditures by function
or sector, with the partial exception of showing expenditures on target beneficiary groups, such as
women or children, for block grant spending. Consolidated financial reports are not aggregated at any
level. The Auditor General’s Office audits DDCs while private auditors are used for municipalities and
VDCs; there appears to be limited follow up on audit findings.

Frontline Service Delivery in the Roads Sector

11.      LBs are broadly responsible for the local roads network. The local roads network is
defined as roads which are not part of the national Strategic Road Network (SRN). Although the
Department of Roads is in some instances involved with the local roads sector, most construction,
upgrading and maintenance of the Local Road Network (LRN) is undertaken by LBs. However, the
central Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads in MoFALD
exercises substantial guidance through the provision of conditional grants and supervision of local
District Technical Offices.

12.      LBs work on local roads is funded out of their discretionary resources and conditional
grants. Only DDCs and municipalities receive conditional grants. The extent to which LBs spend their
discretionary resources in the local roads sector varies: municipalities spend the highest proportion,
followed by DDCs and then VDCs.

13.    Annual roads sector planning at the district level is guided by District Transport Master
Plans (DTMPs). DTMPs only provide a framework for the District Road Core Network (DRCN), for
which DDCs are responsible. However, they do not govern planning of village or municipal roads
which can account for up to 50% of the length of all registered local roads. Moreover, DDCs when
                                                 vii
 
 


using their discretionary revenues follow the annual LB planning process with little reference to their
DTMPs. This results in diffuse spending on a large number of relatively small projects, most of which
are implemented by so called User Committees rather than contractors.

14.     The flow of funds from conditional grants can complicate integrated planning for the
roads network. There are a large number of conditional grants for items involving the local roads
network, including separate grants for local roads, agricultural roads, suspension bridges, and bridges.
Frequent end-of-year budget reallocations by the central government and ad hoc funding make
planning difficult. Delays in fund release are common and result in impromptu adjustments to local
roads sector plans.

15.      Technical capacity at the local level is limited. VDCs almost never have full-time technical
staff and the District Technical Offices (DTOs) lack the resources to service all local needs. There are
about 1,150 total staff in all DTOs which handle all local infrastructure projects, including local roads,
while there are annually in excess of 100,000 small local projects in all LBs. Providing engineering
oversight for the over 100 annual works projects in DDCs alone stretches capacity.

Frontline Service Delivery in the Basic (Primary and Lower Secondary) Education Sector

16.     Planning, supervision of delivery, and quality control in the basic education sector
(grades 1-8) is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its Department of
Education (DoE). Sub-nationally, District Education Offices (DEOs) supervise, monitor and channel
funds to schools. At the local level, School Management Committees (SMCs, elected by parents)
ensure day-to-day management functions, including expenditure.

17.     The sector has decentralized most operational issues to the School Management
Committees. SMCs are expected to provide regular financial and progress reports to their respective
DOEs. These financial reports presently are limited to grants received from the central government
and currently do not include other sources of income, such as from rents or grants from LBs which are
referred to as ‘off-budget’ income. In principle, school financial accounts are audited every year by
private sector auditors; in practice, 40% of schools do not undergo regular annual audits though they
continue to receive grants.

18.    LBs have a formal but unrealized role in education through Education Committees. Each
VEC, MEC, and DEC is to be chaired by the head of the corresponding LB. They have a mandate to
engage in planning, resource mobilization, and monitoring. However, these bodies rarely meet.
Planning and execution of school budgets occurs via SMCs and the offices of the Ministry of
Education.

19.      Primary and lower secondary schools receive most of their funding through grants from
the central government. Well over 90% of schools budgets are from central government grants. The
per student amounts provided to districts and then passed on to schools vary considerably between
districts, with Dhankuta district receiving twice as much as Dhanusa.

20.      LB contributions to schools’ financing are a small and declining proportion of total
school income. While reports from 2008 and 2009 indicated as much as 13% of total school
expenditures being financed by LBs, data from schools in Dhankuta and Dhanusa showed LBs
contributing less than 2% of total revenues in the three years from 2009/10 to 2012/13. These figures
are consistent with the larger schools public expenditure tracking survey completed in 2013. In
addition to providing schools with operating grants, LBs spend directly on the construction of school
buildings and facilities, the purchase of books and equipment, and on a range of other items or
activities. Regulations prohibit LBs from directly contracting with teachers, though grants once
received by schools can be utilized by SMCs for any type of expenditure. LB direct spending on
school education is dispersed among numerous small items.

21.     The decline in LB spending in the basic education sector is due to a perception of
relatively lower needs of schools, though not to perceptions of lower importance of education.
Many schools are currently carrying over significant unspent balances from one year to the next. This
implies that schools do not need (or are not seen to need) supplementary funding from LBs. In the case
of Dhankuta, this has been compounded by an overall 25% drop in enrolment between 2009/10 and
2012/13. At the same time, survey results show that education is rated among the most important
public services by local citizens.

22.     There are aspects of education outside of operating schools where the Education
Committees should, but do not presently play a role. These include issues of getting out-of-school
children into schools, reconfiguring local schools as a response to declining enrolment rates, and
addressing the factors underlying drop-out rates. LBs do not appear to address such education issues in
their own planning processes or through their leadership of local Education Committees.

Recommendations

23.      The findings of this study point to two sets of potential measures to improve frontline
service delivery: long term changes in the institutional framework and short and medium term
actionable steps within the existing framework. Improvements can be made both in LBs’ general
performance and capacity to contribute to service delivery, as well as actions that directly concern the
local roads and basic education sectors.

Long Term Institutional Considerations

24.     Long term fundamental changes must be considered within the context of broader
deliberations on federalism in Nepal as well as ongoing efforts to strengthen LBs. While
deliberations to date on changing the government structure have focused on defining federal units, the
role of LBs and the lower links in the service delivery chain will also be critical elements. Local
governments are likely to have a place in a new federal system, albeit not necessarily the existing
units. Changes could also build on local governance reforms undertaken under MoFALD’s Local
Governance and Community Development Program.

25.    Changes to the institutional framework could seek to build stronger lines of
accountability for service delivery, addressing the classic ‘building blocks’ of decentralized
government: functions, finance, and functionaries. This could include:
       Clarifying functional assignments by: introducing the concept of ‘own exclusive’ assignments
        for LBs; allow for asymmetric assignment, recognizing geographic and demographic
        variations among local government units; delineating tasks for shared functions; retaining
        substantial local discretion to take on functions voluntarily since LBs are best positioned to
        respond to local needs and priorities; ensuring harmonization with other (sectoral) legislation,
        particularly the Government Rules of Business;
       Strengthening the intergovernmental financial system to provide more predictability and
        stimulate local revenue collection effort. Reforms in revenue assignments could focus on
        boosting own source revenues, while fiscal transfers could be consolidated, made more
        predictable and equitable, and designed so as to incentivize own source revenue collection at
        the sub-national level;
       Developing personnel systems that support local bodies’ administrative authority, creating a
        local government cadre; and
       Conducting elections to LBs in order to constitute them in a manner that makes them
        accountable to citizens. Though elections are far from the only means of building downward
        accountability, they would play an overall framework that would incentivize performance in
        serving citizens in localities.

Potential Actionable Steps in the Short and Medium Term

For the Government of Nepal, initiated by MoFALD in the Short Term:

26.      Address LB human resource constraints. LBs, especially VDCs, would benefit from
additional capacity in accounting and in basic engineering. Two options may be considered:
     Provide for accountant and overseer positions among VDC staff, and augment positions in
         DDCs and municipalities.
     Facilitate the hiring of accountants and overseers which could be shared by several VDCs and
         perhaps municipalities and DDCs.
Such a change could involve establishing links with professional associations (such as the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Nepal) that have members who can provide these technical and managerial
inputs. Additional personnel are likely to require additional financing, though this could be justified by
the fact that LBs are receiving six times more funds than before. Any increase in funding for personnel
could be matched with more rigorous monitoring of standards for financial management and technical
inputs.

27.     Adjust planning processes. Although much of the planning process is mandated by law and
hence not easily changed, there may be adjustments that could lead to more strategic and service-
focused plans which incorporate principles of good public investment management. These are:
       Introducing needs assessments into the planning process. This could involve having
        mandatory planning formats that LBs could use to estimate the baseline levels of service,
        constraints and problems in key local service sectors, e.g. roads, water & sanitation, education,
        and health. These assessments could encourage more strategic investments as well as
        consideration of how LB activities can contribute towards improving the quality and/or
        quantity of those services.
       Harmonizing the LB and sector planning calendar. This could allow for more synergy at the
        local level.
       Orienting local planning processes towards a medium-term or ‘pipeline’ perspective. This
        would address short-termism and the danger of ‘participation fatigue’ of annual planning
        exercises.

28.    Strengthen LBs financial management framework. The increase in resources makes
improving the framework whereby LBs manage their funds a priority. There are several actions that
might be considered:
       Unifying, harmonizing and simplifying reporting formats and making their use mandatory.
        Reports could consolidate various revenues and expenditures, regardless of source into one
        document that is exactly the same for all LBs of the same type.
       Strengthening MoFALD capacity to ensure reporting and interpret LBs’ spending patterns.
        MoFALD could become able to collate and use LB reports for purposes of monitoring and
        broader strategic planning.
       Incrementally introducing functional expenditure reporting. This could start with reporting on
        capital or developmental expenditures, for which LBs would be expected to provide a simple
        but clear breakdown in terms of sectors, regardless.
       Consolidating bank accounts held by LBs. This could reduce fiduciary risk as well as
        encourage LBs to report on expenditures and revenues in a more comprehensive and less
        piecemeal way.
       Removing a local bottleneck in the disbursement of transfers. While delays in
        intergovernmental transfers are beyond MoFALD’s control, at the local level LDOs’ authority
        to release funds to VDCs creates unwarranted delays. Rather than having LDOs wait to group
        requests from VDCs before approving disbursements, VDCs could submit their financial
        reports directly to the DTCO with a copy to their DDC. The DDC would have a set time
                                                    x
 
 


        period (for instance two weeks) to raise any concerns; in the absence of written concerns, the
        DTCO would be authorized to release funds directly to the VDC’s account.

For the Government of Nepal, initiated by MoFALD in the Medium Term:

29.      Delineate service responsibilities to the extent possible within existing legislation.
Delineation should occur between DDCs and primary tier VDCs and municipalities, as well as in
relation to central government agencies. For services which presently are essentially overseen by the
central government through deconcentrated departments, such as education, guidance on what LBs are
responsible for could be developed in conjunction with sector agencies.

30.     A delineation of service responsibilities might first be modelled and tested for a few
functions. There are many types of inputs and activities that are carried out to deliver services, with
much differentiation among services. The GoN might consider modelling a detailed description of
what LBs (with differentiation among VDCs, municipalities, and DDCs) and what line agencies would
be responsible for in two or three functions. One would be a case where there is clearly a large role
played by LBs (e.g. local roads, water supply) and the other might be a case where central agencies
will play a major role (e.g. social services such as health or education). The delineation would
distinguish between operational authority to make decisions on quantity and quality of services
delivered; long term planning, including capital investment; service standards; oversight and
monitoring functions; and incentives for performance.

31.     Simplify the system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Conditional grants that target the
same sector, such as local roads or water & sanitation, could to the extent possible be provided at the
same time and have harmonized reporting requirements. Consolidation could help central management
of fund flows and, more importantly, could provide an enabling framework for a more strategic
approach to service delivery in these functional areas.

32.     Improve the predictability of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. This could include
avoiding ad hoc and mid/end year allocations, providing LBs with future transfer ceilings prior to the
annual local planning/budgeting cycle, and considering more formula-driven allocations which
recognize objective disparities among LB jurisdictions, particularly for conditional grants.

For DoLIDAR/MoFALD:

33.     More fully integrate the District Technical Offices into the DDC structure, rather than
preserving the at times competitive structure in place. While there are valid reasons to insulate
DTOs from local influence (including political), if LBs are to be made accountable for service areas
they could benefit from an integrated management structure to deliver.

For the Ministry of Education and the Education Sector:

34.    Carry through with plans to consolidate school reporting of all revenue and
expenditures, including from LBs, NGOs and OSR in FY 2014/15. This could help SMCs make
more strategic use of available resources. It would also allow for better overall planning and
deployment of resources for basic education at the national level.

35.     Clarify the roles and responsibilities of Education Committees at local levels to address
issues of providing education beyond the operation of schools. The VECs/MECs/DECs should be
promoted as fora within which education sector activities are coordinated at the local level without
getting into issues of individual school management that are handled by SMCs and supervised by
DEOs. Local level Education Committees can play a role in addressing questions of attendance,
enrolment, and, given demographic trends, rationalization. This would require amending the Education
Regulations and cooperation between the MoE and MoFALD to provide local Education Committees
with active guidance and support. Such work could be undertaken irrespective of whether a more
profound delineation of functions is undertaken in the sector.

                                        I.   INTRODUCTION

36.      The effectiveness of public service delivery depends in large part on the capability,
resources and inputs, and the motivation of frontline service providers. Higher level inputs, such
as curriculum development for education, are critical for the quality of and access to services, but the
provision of services occurs at the local level – at the ‘last mile’ of the chain of service delivery –
where services are actually received by citizens.1 In theory, inputs are converted to service outputs
which in turn contribute to better public service outcomes for the population at the local level.
Therefore, the factors influencing the provision of services at the local level are integral to overall
service delivery. As has been observed in many contexts2, one of the key factors is the institutional
framework for frontline service provision, because this framework in turn establishes chains of
accountability for results which spur performance.

37.     Public services are provided by a combination of deconcentrated line agencies and local
bodies3 in Nepal, but the respective roles and relationships among these entities in providing
services could be more clearly defined. There
appears to be overlap in responsibility in legislation      Box 1: Public Service – A Definition
which has underpinned parallel reform efforts for        A public service is a service benefiting the
local governance and in service sectors. In particular,  public that is provided for by the government
the institutional framework for local government         because it is underprovided by the market. The
remains incomplete. The legislated mandate for           public benefits from outputs and outcomes of
devolution of key public services is limited in practice the given service, not merely inputs. For
by a lack of implementing regulations and the            instance, buildings, textbooks, teachers,
issuance of government rules of business which make      assurance of pedagogical training and quality
                                                         instruction, are all inputs for delivery of
line agencies responsible for most aspects of service    education service, but the public service is to
delivery. The role of local bodies (LBs) has been        yield an output of students with skills.
weakened due the absence of elected councils since
2002.

38.     Despite the uncertainties around their role, local bodies play an increasingly important
part in service provision at the local level. The size of transfers from the central government to local
bodies has increased six-fold between 2006 and 2012. The local bodies’ share in total public
expenditures has been around 10% for the past three years, a proportion that is considerably higher
than in other South Asian countries. Even accounting for the conditional grants over which LBs
exercise limited discretion and which make up over half of LB budgets, the proportion of local
expenditures is relatively high.

39.      There is limited understanding of what local bodies are doing to deliver services. It is
difficult to assess how much is being spent, how activities and allocations are prioritized, and what
types of outputs and outcomes are achieved in service areas at the local level. Reporting mechanisms
are limited in their regularity, enforcement and transparency. There are currently no requirements to
report by sector, which means that it is impossible to know how much is being spent on education,
roads or any other sector by a particular LB or the aggregate of all LBs. Instead, LBs report on
‘development’ spending, which can be a mix of recurrent and capital costs. There is also self-reporting
on the types of beneficiaries, or target groups, in the use of some grants. Thus, LBs may report that
primary beneficiaries are certain types of disadvantaged groups, but the service area involved is often
not known.

  Local bodies are Village Development Committees, Municipalities, and District Development Committees as
per the 1999 Local Self Governance Act. As their names suggest, the entities were initially conceived of as
development agents, rather than local government per se. The term local bodies (LBs) is the common general
term for these entities.

                                  Box 2: The Police Station in Pakhribas Village
    Pakhribas VDC in Dhankuta District spent 300,000 NPR – around 15% of its discretionary budget – to
    purchase land for a police station in FY 2009/10. The decision emerged from the VDC’s grassroots planning
    for use of funds. Funding for the land purchase was the second largest of 31 allocations for a mix of
    livelihoods schemes for women, local roads, small infrastructure for schools, and other projects. Pakhribas is
    not alone in having this spending pattern: all local bodies fund a large number of small projects across a range
    of sectors. Other VDCs and DDCs also spend on the police. Yet public security is not a function for VDCs or
    DDCs.
    This spending pattern raises questions about frontline service delivery and the role of local bodies in their
    delivery. Why did the VDC use limited resources for a service over which it had no responsibility or
    authority? Is the VDC simply responsively using its funds to address local needs across a range of public
    services? Is it a case of local capture of resources? Is the VDC then accountable for the quality of police
    services or for service delivery in other areas where it provides albeit modest funding? Does the allocation
    give the VDC a say in how the funds are used? Does it give the VDC a role in how the police perform?


40.     There is also limited understanding of how deconcentrated line agencies interact with
LBs to deliver services. Nepal’s governmental system treats LBs and local development as a ‘sector’
unto itself, rather than a contributor to the delivery of services in a sector such as education. The
system does not allow for understanding how LBs are contributing to service outcomes. LBs are
viewed as contributing to development in general rather than to any particular outcome in the
provision of specific public services, such as water or the rural road network. There are mechanisms in
place for local level coordination between line agencies and local bodies, but the extent to which this
coordination is effective is not clear.

41.    This study seeks to map out the dynamics of frontline service delivery in Nepal. It is
based on a rapid review conducted over four months of service delivery in two sectors – local roads
and primary and lower secondary education – in 14 LB jurisdictions in two districts.4 The study

  The districts of Dhankuta and Dhanusa were chosen to reflect the situation in a relatively well performing and
resourced hill district and a more populous, less well performing and resourced district in the country’s southern
Terai region. The jurisdictions in Dhankuta were: Dhankuta DDC, Dhankuta municipality, and Bhedetar,

analyzes the formal framework for local bodies’ operations and service delivery in the basic education
and local roads sectors. It compares de jure arrangements with data on what actually occurred over a
three year period from 2009 to 2012 in the reviewed jurisdictions. Information about budgets, staffing,
and planning was gathered by two field-based consultant teams. It proved difficult to obtain
comprehensive budget and planning data at the local level for analysis, but nonetheless there is
sufficient information on service delivery in this small number of jurisdictions to serve as case studies
in the context of existing knowledge about the formal institutional framework. In addition, the study
included a field survey of individual citizens and local officials in the same LB jurisdictions. The
survey covered 3,200 local citizens and local officials in DDCs, VDCs and municipalities sampled in
Dhankuta and Dhanusa. The survey was intended to assess perceptions about local governance and
service delivery responsibilities, as well as the quality of services. Citizens’ perceptions thus provide
an important, if not all-encompassing, measure of outputs and outcomes from service delivery. A
detailed description of the districts and the methodology for the study and its two field surveys is
provided in Annexes 1 and 5.

42.      The limited service delivery orientation and coordination challenges among increasingly
well-resourced local bodies suggest that there is an opportunity to improve the organization of
frontline service delivery. This would involve both providing incentives for more orientation of local
bodies towards their role in the delivery of services and for ensuring greater synergies and
responsiveness among local bodies and deconcentrated line departments. The purpose of this report is
to examine in detail the current dynamics of frontline service delivery to identify institutional
limitations and propose approaches to addressing them.

        II.   INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY

43.     The institutional framework for service delivery is defined by functional assignments (or
the placement of responsibility for provision of public services with respective public entities), fiscal
assignments (the system for financing of public entities to perform their responsibilities), and
administrative assignments (the powers given respective public entities to carry out their
responsibilities, such as control over staffing or planning and execution of the quantity of services
provided). Assignments are typically among levels of government, which assumes some degree of
autonomy of sub-national units. Nepal’s intergovernmental system is quite complex de jure. This is
further compounded by how LBs have developed and adapted since their introduction decades ago.
This section reviews the governance arrangements of local bodies, functional assignments, and the
intergovernmental fiscal framework.

A. Brief History of Sub-National Government in Nepal

44.      Nepal has had sub-national government institutions for 50 years. The current structure of
sub-national administration and governance – based on districts and villages – was established in the
1960s in the Panchayat era. Districts and villages have been a part of Nepal’s sub-national
institutional landscape for as long as most Nepalese can remember. A watershed in their development
was the 1982 Decentralization Act, which provided for elected district and village panchayats, albeit
on a non-party basis and with nominated and elected members. The functions and responsibilities of
these early panchayats were largely limited to the maintenance of public goods and social order. They
had few own source revenues and fiscal transfers were limited.

45.     Following the establishment of multi-party democracy and promulgation of a new
constitution in 1990, District Development Committees (DDCs), Village Development
Committees (VDCs), and municipalities were established under separate DDC, VDC and
municipality Acts adopted in 1991. Full multi-party local elections were held in 1992. The first
block grants for LBs were put into place in 1995. New local elections were held in 1998 for five year
terms. The three local body acts were subsequently combined in the Local Self Governance Act
(LSGA) of 1999, which remains the over-arching legal framework for sub-national government. In
2002, as part of a policy of sector devolution, the government officially devolved three key sectors
(primary education, primary health and agricultural & livestock services) to LBs, giving further
impetus to decentralization reforms. Later ‘local infrastructure’ was normatively devolved.

46.      Local government reforms were undermined by the armed conflict between the
Government and Maoist insurgents in the 2000s. The elected local bodies lapsed in 2002 when
elections could not be held and the government decided not to extend the mandate of the LBs elected
in 1998. Since then, despite the re-establishment of a broad democratic process at the national level in
2006, sub-national government has been managed without elected leaders or councils. Instead,
centrally appointed civil servants (LDOs, VDC Secretaries, and EOs, respectively), have been
responsible for the day-to-day management of LBs, with the assistance of other line department
officials in DDCs and municipalities. In 2009, the government established the ‘All-Party Mechanism’
(APM), seen as a way of widening accountability by bringing political parties at the sub-national level
into the local body decision-making process. The APM was repealed in 2012 following reports of
corruption, but political parties continue to play a role in local-level decision-making.5 The absence of
locally elected councils since 2002 has diminished downward accountability, as well as the political
status of local bodies. At the same time it has increased the perception that they are ‘branches’ of the
Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD).



5
  Cf. Carter Center (2014), The Asia Foundation (2013). The Carter Center report stresses that political parties
are involved in many organizational structures at local level, including schools, which by regulation are
supposed to be free from such interference.

47.      Decentralization policies and reforms in Nepal have reflected an approach that
emphasizes LBs as conduits for local participation and carrying out small works as development
rather than government responsible for delivering public services. The usage of the term
‘development committee’ and as opposed to council or government denotes this vision. One major
attempt to devolve sectoral responsibility to local bodies was made in 2002, but this was never
implemented due to armed conflict, the dissolution of elected councils, the reservations of line
ministries to devolve authority and implementation of government regulations which kept powers
within the line agencies. In the recent post-conflict period, the same local development vision of sub-
national government has remained unchanged. In recent years, increasingly large intergovernmental
fiscal transfers (see section D on the intergovernmental fiscal framework below) have been central
government’s principal mechanism for strengthening sub-national government – but with little
concomitant effort made to make local bodies increasingly responsible for service delivery.

B. Sub-National Governance Arrangements

48.      The legal framework for sub-national governance is the Local Self Governance Act
(1999) and the Government of Nepal (Allocation of Business) Rules (2008, amended in 2009).
While the LSGA provides the legal basis for LBs, government rules allocate public sector
responsibilities, including issues of frontline service delivery, in detail among national ministries.
Nepal has an interim constitution which provides for a federal system of government and local self-
governance and has committed to having a new constitution as soon as possible. Questions of how to
structure a federal state and sub-national governance are the most contentious issue in this drafting
process.

49.    Nepal has two tiers of sub-national institutions. At the lowest level, there are 3,915 Village
Development Committees (VDCs) and 58 Municipalities. At a higher level, there are 75 District
Development Committees (DDCs), the territory of which overlaps with the VDCs and municipalities.

50.     There is significant variation within the same types of jurisdictions. VDCs on average
serve and represent relatively small populations. Their small size may prevent VDCs from capturing
economies of scale in service delivery, thus potentially compromising their ability to function as
viable local government units6. Yet there are outliers: VDCs in the Terai, are typically a great deal

6
    See Boex (2012): 4-5

                                                       16
 
 


larger than VDCs in mountainous or middle hills areas in terms of population, but much smaller in
terms of their area. DDCs also vary significantly by demography and topography. Municipalities
include the large cities in the Kathmandu Valley and small towns of under 20,000 people.

51.      The geography and topography of local jurisdictions have different implications in
terms of their fiscal capacity. Most LBs in the Terai are likely to have access to more own source
revenues than their counterparts in the mountainous or middle hills zones.7 Not only is agricultural
land more valuable (and therefore a stronger tax base) in the Terai, but the area’s proximity to India
and trans-national commerce also provides LBs there with a more vibrant tax base8. LBs in mountain
areas correspondingly lack these opportunities. At the same time, service provision is much more
difficult in remote locations with less traversable geography and dispersed small populations.
However, despite their objective differences there is no differentiation in the institutional framework
for bodies of the same type. All VDCs, municipalities, and DDCs operate under the same regulations
and arrangements as their respective peers.

Linkages between DDCs and Municipalities/VDCs

52.      Municipalities are largely autonomous of DDCs, while VDCs are more closely
subordinated to DDCs by law and in practice. For example, the disbursement of fiscal transfers to
VDCs is subject to DDC authorization in practice, but the same is not true of municipalities. VDC
internal audits are carried out by DDCs, which also play a role in approving the selection of VDC
external auditors; municipal internal and external audits, on the other hand, are not subject to any
involvement on the part of DDCs. In addition, whilst the planning and scheme implementation
processes for DDCs and VDCs are (in principle, at least) inter-twined, there are few linkages between
DDCs and municipalities when it comes to planning and scheme implementation. Finally (and
perhaps most importantly), LDOs are almost always Under-Secretaries and as such always outrank
VDC Secretaries in the civil service hierarchy. However, EOs in municipalities are usually of the
same civil service grade as LDOs. In the absence of elected local councils, this has reinforced the
degree to which VDCs are subordinate to DDCs. In sum, while municipal performance is not
constrained or enhanced by DDC performance, VDC performance is partly conditioned by how well
(or badly) DDCs carry out back-office functions with respect to VDCs.

53.      Though not in effect at present since elections have not been held, the de jure system for
elected LBs provides for organic linkages between DDCs and VDCs/municipalities. Legislation
provides for the direct election of village and municipal councilors. District councils and DDC
leaders, however, are not directly elected – instead, they are indirectly elected by an electoral college
made up of village and municipal councils within the district in question. This means that district
councils and development committees are electorally accountable to village and municipal councils,
which would imply that district governments are likely to be sensitive to the opinions and priorities of
lower tier LBs.

Governance and Staffing of Local Bodies

54.      Despite the absence of elected representatives, the provisions of the LSGA continue to
apply to LB governance arrangements, through non-elected local councils. At all levels, local
‘councils’ remain in place as deliberative bodies, with the official function of approving plans and
budgets, providing oversight and endorsing key decisions. Such councils, however, are not made up
of elected members but instead consist of a mix of civil servants, local political leaders, and
representatives from other stakeholder institutions (such as local NGOs)9. LDOs, EOs and VDC
Secretaries function as both de facto chairpersons of these councils and as the day-to-day executives
of their respective LBs.

  With perhaps the singular exception of local bodies located in the Kathmandu Valley.

  See the section on the intergovernmental fiscal framework of this report.

  There are considerable variations in the composition of local councils.

55.      Core staff in local bodies are provided and financed through earmarked grants by the
central government. The following table provides a summary of LB staffing positions that are
typically filled by such civil servants.

                           Table 2: LB staff positions filled by civil servants

    Local body                     Seconded civil servant staff
    DDC                               DDC Secretary (Local Development Officer)
                                      District engineer(s) in the District Technical Office (DTO)
                                      DDC Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Officer
                                      DDC Finance Officer and Accountants
    Municipality                      Municipal Secretary (Executive Officer)
    VDC                               VDC Secretary

56.      Secondments of civil servants tend to be the same for and across all levels of the local
government system, irrespective of the size or importance of the LB in question. Thus, central
government provides VDCs with one secretary only regardless of whether the VDC serves a
population of less than 5,000 or a population of more than 30,000. Institutional ‘equivalence’
translates into staffing ‘equivalence’ when it comes to civil service secondments. Moreover, seconded
staffing levels tend to reflect the perceived roles of LBs. VDCs only have one secretary who is a
junior civil servant. This appears to reflect the vision of their playing a role as conduits for funding of
small works rather than units for ongoing service delivery. DDCs, on the other hand, have more
seconded staff, reflecting their role as coordinating bodies. Municipalities are in between, with only
one centrally appointed Executive Officer (EO) who usually has a rank similar to the LDO.

57.      Generally speaking, the central government fulfils its requirement of providing DDCs
and municipalities with core staff, though there are reportedly quite frequent rotations and
occasional cases of absenteeism. At the VDC level, however, an estimated 500 VDCs throughout the
country are currently without secretaries10; these VDCs are covered by secretaries from other VDCs.
There are cases of one secretary covering even more than two VDCs. There is also a large degree of
reported absenteeism among VDC secretaries. During the conflict this was justified by the dangers of
a central government employee being exposed in the countryside, but the problem reportedly
continues at present. Some VDC secretaries in Dhanusa indicated that they worked mostly in the main
city in the district.

58.      Other full-time staff at the local level are hired as needed by the LBs themselves and
paid for out of their own budgets.11 For the most part, such locally financed positions are usually
junior (e.g. book-keepers or filing clerks in DDCs and municipalities, overseers and assistants in
VDCs) or of an administrative support profile (e.g. night watchmen or drivers). The five VDCs
surveyed in Dhanusa, for example, had a total of 11 locally hired staff: a technical assistant and an
office helper in each of the five VDCs and a health worker in one. The DDC in Dhanusa, in addition
to seconded civil servants, employs 22 locally-hired staff as internal auditors, accountants, office
assistants and administrative staff.

59.     There has been policy debate about establishing a local civil service cadre, from which
LBs would be able to recruit senior executive officials (such as LDOs). This debate recognizes that
the current system – by which senior LB executive officials are central government civil servants – is


10
  Himalayan Times, 8 March 2014.
11
  LSGA (articles 249-252) provides LBs with considerable latitude when it comes to hiring staff. The principal
constraint to taking on more staff or short term employees is budgetary.

                                                      18
 
 


sub-optimal. Frequent rotations of senior LB staff, which are the result of central-level decisions12
(rather than LB decisions), tend to reduce continuity. More importantly, key LB officers are
effectively accountable to MoFALD, the entity which appointed them and provides a career
framework. This line of accountability to the center has been significantly strengthened in the absence
of local elected representatives who could monitor performance (and which was reputedly successful
when there were elected LBs). The incentive structure for this staff is to be less responsive to local
priorities and more responsive to central directives and policies.

Central Government Agencies Engaged with Local Bodies

60.      The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development is responsible for policy and
execution of programs on decentralization, local self-governance, and local development,
including much local infrastructure.13 It also oversees coordination relations among LBs. MoFALD
provides LBs with conditional and unconditional grants/transfers14 and for seconding (or deputing)
core staff to LBs. MoFALD also provides LBs with guidelines and technical backstopping, as well as
being responsible for regular monitoring of LBs and their performance15 Finally, a division within
MoFALD runs the nation-wide social safety net programs, issuing guidelines and funds to LBs for
providing social benefits.

61.      MoFALD implements the Local Government and Community Development Program, a
large technical assistance program for LBs funded by multiple donors. LGCDP has worked to
institute a number of practices at the local level, particularly social accountability mechanisms. This
has included deploying social mobilizers, developing Ward Citizen Forums and Citizen Awareness
Centers, promoting social audit mechanisms, and addressing aspects of fiduciary risk.

62.      MoFALD’s mandate of supporting local governance and decentralization and its role in
ensuring development occurs in the form of rural infrastructure do not always coincide.16
Previously known simply as the Ministry of Local Development, MoFALD is often seen as a line
ministry, with LBs operating as if they were local level line departments of the ministry carrying out
local development. MoFALD houses the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and
Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR), a central agency that oversees national schemes for local
infrastructure, mostly with donor funding. DoLIDAR supervises District Technical Offices (DTOs)
which in turn are authorized to supervise most local infrastructure projects financed by the DDCs.

63.     Central level coordination on service delivery is hampered by a ‘sectoral’ orientation of
government agencies. MoFALD focuses on local bodies and their operations, in much the same way
as the Ministry of Education oversees the activities of its line departments and schools at the local
level. Outside of the overall coordination which occurs in the national planning process, there are few
mechanisms for MoFALD to coordinate with other line ministries on operational issues. For example,
there are no permanent and functional inter-ministerial committees that work on roles and
responsibilities in the education sector or coordinate inputs into service delivery.

64.    MoFALD’s mandate related to Municipalities overlaps with that of the Ministry of
Urban Development (MoUD). MoUD is responsible for urban development (see Government of
Nepal Allocation of Business Rules 2008, amended in 2012) and has adopted an urban development
12
   Understandably, LDOs and EOs often lobby the ministry to avoid being posted to remote or ‘problematic’
LBs or to be transferred to localities or to Kathmandu.
13
   The full listing of MoFALD’s functions is included in the Government of Nepal (Allocation of Business)
Rules (2008, amended in 2009),
14
   Which are included in the ministry’s annual budget.
15
   Most notably through the annual MC/PM assessments of DDCs and municipalities, the results of which are
endorsed and acted upon by the ministry.
16
    This tension is discussed in considerable detail in Institutional Assessment of the Ministry of Local
Development, Atos Consulting (2008) – a report commissioned by DFID and submitted to (the then) MLD
during the preparatory and design phase for LGCDP.

strategy. MoUD has jurisdiction over the Town Development Committees created under the Town
Development Act, 1988 and the Town Development Fund (TDF). Responsibilities of the TDC
(chaired by a government nominee) include “land use planning for the development of town and
provision for services and facilities such as road, transport, electricity, drainage, sanitation and open
space” which is what a municipality is also supposed to do under the LSGA. The autonomous TDF
provides financial (lending) and technical support to municipalities in delivering ‘basic social
services’ (e.g., streets, roads, electricity, bridges, drinking water, drainage, collection of garbage,
public toilets, public libraries, and schools) and ‘income oriented projects’ (e.g., public markets, trade
centers, bus terminals, slaughter houses, warehouses). The Department for Urban Development and
Building Construction (DUDBC) is mandated to coordinate the activities of TDCs and TDF on behalf
of the MoUD, and is involved in the formulation of municipalities’ periodic plans, GIS maps, poverty
mapping and Town Development Committees. The National Urban Policy recognizes this challenge
and advocates for better cooperation/coordination between MoFALD and MoUD at the central level.

Planning in Local Bodies

65.     LBs are required to formulate periodic and annual plans. The LSGA and the Resource
Mobilization and Operation Management Guidelines (2013) provide for a participatory, inclusive
framework for planning, management, implementation, resource allocation and budgeting,
supervision, monitoring and evaluation, reporting and oversight activities.17 The participatory
planning process is known as the fourteen steps planning process, which begins at the community
level and moves up to the national level (NPC and MoF). Village, municipal and district councils are
all expected to finalize their respective plans within their budget ceilings. LBs can submit project
proposals for inclusion in the plans of higher tiers in the intergovernmental system. See Annex 2 for a
detailed breakdown of the role of the principal institutional stakeholders and the planning process.

66.     All LBs are expected to prepare five year periodic plans in a participatory way, in
accordance with NPC directives.18 Local periodic plans should meet several criteria:
     include long term goals, objectives and strategies and cover major functional areas or sectors
      that are devolved to local bodies;
     include gender, social inclusion, the environment and children as cross-cutting issues in all
      sectors;
     be prepared on a spatial basis and on the basis of an analysis of spatial factors;
     encompass the key elements of sector-specific plans;
     forecast and take into account resource projections;
     take into account potential developmental and contributions from central government, NGOs
      and the private sector (which are to be coordinated with LB activities and investments included
      in LB periodic plans);
     support and complement national plans and contribute to national goals, objectives and overall
      targets.

67.      LBs are expected to formulate inclusive, participatory, integrated and comprehensive
annual plans based on their periodic plans. This requires both the communication downwards of
resource envelopes and an upward planning process to prioritize projects from grassroots community
groups up to the DDCs. In terms of downward communication, line ministries are expected to provide
their district level departments with annual budget ceilings, estimate sector grants to LBs and issue
guidelines for annual planning. Local line department and district plans should be consistent with
national development policies and plans. Included in this are MoFALD forecasts of annual

17
   VDC, municipal and DDC planning processes are provided for in LSGA (Arts. 43-54, 111-124, and 195-214,
respectively) and LSGR (rules 64-69, 134-139, and 197-206, respectively). The RMOM Guidelines (sections 3-
5) provide LBs with additional instructions for planning in the absence of elected councils.
18
   NPC directives are structured around four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) data and SWOT analysis; (iii) plan
formulation on the basis of a logical framework; and (iv) implementation.

                                                      20
 
 


conditional and unconditional grants. District Resource Estimation Committees19 (DRECs) estimate
the total resources that are expected to be available for each LB in the district for the following year.
These resource envelopes (or budget ceilings) are communicated to the respective LBs. In addition,
VDCs and municipalities will also be expected to estimate their respective resource envelopes.

68.     The upward planning process involves several rounds of meetings and reviews of
proposals. It begins with grassroots community organizations and user groups making proposals
which are successively consolidated, reviewed, and forwarded successively upward to Ward Citizen
Forums (WCFs)20; village level integrated plan formulation committees; the VDC (and municipality);
the Ilaka level which combines several VDCs and municipalities21, the DDC Integrated Plan
Formulation Committee (IPFC); the DDC; affected line agencies; MoFALD; and the National
Planning Commission (NPC). At each level of government, the proposed programs and projects are
reviewed for synergies and whether they fit into communicated budget ceilings. Central level line
departments and ministries may also ask DDCs to include sector-specific projects (identified at the
national level) in their annual plans. Finally, the NPC consolidates these plans and it is integrated with
the budget and approved by Parliament.

                        Figure 2: Normative Participatory Planning Process




19
   The RMOM Guidelines (procedure 18) stipulate that each DDC should establish a District Resource
Estimation Committee.
20
   WCFs consist of 25-30 members, selected in an inclusive way to ensure representation of women and
disadvantaged communities. Although WCFs are not provided for in LSGA/R, the RMOM Guidelines (2013)
do so in order to ensure citizen engagement in the local planning process in the absence of ward committees.
Every VDC has nine Wards; each ward is to elect a member of the Village Development Committee.
21
   There are a total of 927 Ilakas and 3,915 VDCs. On average, Ilakas combine about 4-5 VDCs, although Ilalas
in the Terai tend to be larger than those elsewhere.

                                                     21
 
 



69.     The plan is expected to serve as the basis for concerned ministries to authorize budgets
for respective line departments, project offices, DDCs and municipalities. DDCs then authorize
for VDCs. DDCs request all concerned implementing agencies to prepare their operational calendars
(along with implementation responsibilities) for program implementation and also request them to
prepare funding matrices.

70.      DDCs are expected to form Monitoring Committees under the chairpersonship of an
MP representing the district. If there is more than one MP representing the district, MPs will chair
the committee in alphabetical order. However, few DDCs have followed this. To ensure monitoring,
the RMOM Guidelines (2013) make special provision for the establishment of supervision and
monitoring committees, the meetings of which are to be chaired by the chairpersons of the respective
LBs. This committee monitors whether projects or programs have followed the operational calendar
and whether the funds are used properly or not. The committee is also authorized to monitor outputs
every trimester and submit its report to the LB chair.

71.     The formal planning process does not appear to be followed in full... LBs are not
systematically informed by central government of their budget ceilings on a timely basis. Instead, LBs
are usually asked to prepare next year’s budget on the assumption of a 10% increase on the previous
year’s budget22 On the basis of field observations, DDCs, in turn, generally do not provide
municipalities with information about budget ceilings or guidelines for annual development planning.
However, annual MC/PM (performance) assessments indicate that DDCs do so. The timely provision
of budget ceilings to VDCs/municipalities by DDCs is included as one of the minimum conditions
(MCs); the most recent MC/PM assessment report (201223) indicates that all but one, out of 75, DDCs
complied with this MC.

72.      Though the upward planning process is largely followed. Ward-level planning meetings
do appear to be common, if not universal. In 2008-09, before WCFs were established (through
LGCDP), 42% of a sample of households from just over 200 VDCs reported that ward-level planning
meetings took place.24 Evidence from annual MC/PM assessments of LBs indicates that the majority
do complete their annual planning process on time. Timely completion of annual planning is one of
the MCs that LBs need to comply with. According to the 2011 MC/PM assessment25, only 147 (out of
a total of 3,915) VDCs and 2 municipalities failed to comply with this MC; with the exception of
Kathmandu Metropolitan city, all the LBs that failed to comply were located in the Eastern Terai
region and included Dhanusa.

73.      Grassroots citizen influence on planning is mixed though appears to be growing. A 2009
study of citizen perceptions26 indicated that 39% of the households surveyed claim that VDC priorities
are identified and selected by certain influential interest groups, without any prior community
consultations. According to 35% of the VDC secretaries surveyed in 2008-09, local political leaders
are more often than not able to have their priorities (without reference to proposals from local
citizens) addressed in VDC and municipal plans. At the same time, the WCFs appear to be a
functioning venue for influencing decision-making. As of mid-2013 there were over 35,000 WCFs
established in virtually all districts. Roughly 40% of the over 100,000 projects proposed via WCFs in
2012-13 were financed by LBs, taking up roughly 40% of the latter’s capital budgets.27 Yet survey
results in the two target districts show about 20% of the population feels able to influence the quality
of roads, even though this is an area that is a major expenditure item and for which LBs are seen as

most responsible.28 In addition, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that political parties play a
major role in the WCFs and UCs as well. The level of ‘elite capture’ in the planning process and local
institutions such as WCFs is difficult to assess, particularly in the aggregate (see Box 3).

                               Box 3: Political parties and LB decision-making
    Political parties have played and continue to play an important role in local body decision-making about
    budgets and spending even without an elected local council. Between 2009 and 2012, this was officially
    sanctioned by the All-Party Mechanism (APM), through which local leaders of political parties were able to
    participate in council meetings at all levels of sub-national government. Although the APM was repealed in
    2012, in recognition of mal-practice and excessive politicization, political parties continue to have a say in
    local government affairs. Recent reports by the Asia Foundation (2013) and the Carter Center (2014)
    document how the APM operated in practice, how political parties continue to influence decision-making at
    the local level, and how the active engagement of political parties in local body processes has often been
    driven by partisan, patron-client and pork-barrel politics.
    Politicians everywhere may seek to channel resources to their constituencies. In the case of Nepal, according
    to these studies, there have been numerous reported cases of collusion and corruption associated with the
    involvement of political parties in local body budgetary and spending processes. Some Nepali political leaders
    appear to seek to spread resources widely, so as to satisfy, reward and attract as many supporters as possible.
    Choices appear to be made in terms of the demands that are immediately satisfied, rather than on the basis of
    a blend of political and technocratic considerations.
    The large number of projects also reportedly reflected a balance of party interests in jurisdictions. The
    stronger parties would obtain a bigger ‘piece of the pie’ but lesser parties would also benefit from directing a
    portion of LB resources. It could be argued that the large number of projects served a political purpose of
    providing a stake in local governance processes to a wide range of parties.


74.      Analysis and prioritization of projects appear to be driven by local politics with limited
technical analysis. Planning involves the mediation of a range of interests carried out in multiple
successive meetings. Criteria exist for selection of projects but these do not appear to include rigorous
identification or appraisal of proposed projects and programs. Cost benefit, cost efficiency, or other
appraisal tools are not visibly utilized. Instead, specific individual projects may be proposed and,
depending on general perceptions of importance at successive higher levels, are carried forward.
Perceptions of importance appear to be in large part driven by the weight of the group proposing the
project; decision-making is thus political without a detailed assessment of economic or social
rationale that would allow for comparison according to objective indicators. Both MoFALD and local
officials in the target districts noted that there were strong incentives to simply divide up the resource
envelope equally among groups which represent political and geographical balance. This is reflected
in the expenditure patterns of LBs where there are a large number of small projects in a broad range of
sectors (see paragraphs 96 onwards below). For instance, the Dhankuta DDC decided to provide equal
amounts of funding to each of 22 user committees involved with each of the 22 roads in the District
Transport Plan.

75.      There appear to be few genuine linkages between LBs’ plans and those of line agencies
or national plans. VDC/municipal integrated plan formulation committees (IPFCs) exist and meet
but there is little evidence that they analyze linkages between priority proposals across or within
sectors. DDC level IPFCs also meet in order to comply with procedures but do not appear to analyze
intra- or inter-sector linkages between proposed activities. Moreover the planning schedule for LBs
does not correspond to those of line agencies, meaning that planning often occurs in parallel.
Although line ministries are expected to examine the district-level annual plans that are submitted to
them by DDCs, observations indicate that line ministries pay limited attention to local plans and do
not provide DDCs with systematic feedback on their annual plans. The same appears to be the case
with respect to the NPC. Given this, genuine linkages between district level priorities and national
plans appear to be limited.

                             Box 4: Do LBs manage their public investments effectively?
    The processes that govern public investment selection and management are critical in determining the
    efficiency of public expenditure, in general, and capital expenditure, in particular. When sound and robust
    processes and controls are used in public investment management, capital expenditure is more likely to be
    efficient, justifiable and yield value for money. A number of key features should be in place if public
                                                           29
    investment management is to be as efficient as possible .
    While these key features are vital in the management of large public investments (such as building a new
    highway), some of them may be less appropriate in the case of the public investments that are typically
    undertaken by local governments. To begin with, local public investments are usually smaller, making for
    more of a trade-off between the time and resources to carry out a rigorous investment management process
    and the benefits derived from such a process. In particular, local governments have access to limited human
    resources and cannot be expected to follow all the steps that might be expected to be followed when managing
    large public investments.
    Nonetheless, the basic principles underlying ‘must have’ key features remain relevant to local government
    public investments. Many of the features provide for greater use of objective evidence in the selection and
    implementation of investments, while not negating the political aspects of government being responsive and
    delivering to local constituencies. The process in Nepal is relatively weak in providing for objective
    investment management.

        Key PIM feature                                                How and why (not)?
                                     local PIM?
                                                     Some (but not all) LBs have periodic or sector master
     Investment guidance,
                                                     plans, but these rarely provide a strategic framework to

                                                     guide investments. Moreover, annual investment planning

                                                     is infrequently linked to periodic or master plans.
                                                     LBs rarely conduct thorough feasibility studies of
     Formal project appraisal                        investment projects, due to a lack of technical capacity,
                                       Rarely

                                                     Investments are usually (but not always) linked into the
     Project selection and
                                       Partly        annual budgeting process. However, there are no medium-

                                                     term budgetary frameworks at the local level.
                                                     Given that the preferred implementation option is through
                                                     user committees, there are no local procurement plans.

                                                     size of most investment projects.

                                                     adaptable ways.
                                                     Investments are typically ‘handed over’ to local user

Financial Management in Local Bodies

76.     LBs’ expenditures consist of recurrent costs for their own core administration, social
benefit transfers, and a range of small, mostly capital projects. Budget execution for core
administration is carried out via the accountant or accounting department for the corresponding LB.

     See Rajaram etalia. (2010).

Delivery of social benefit payments to beneficiaries is carried out directly by VDC and municipality
staff and accounted for accordingly.

77.      User Committees are the primary vehicle for carrying out LB-funded projects. A 2009
report reviewing over 200 VDCs found that 79% of projects funded out of block grant resources are
implemented through user committees (UCs), 7% by school management committees, 5% by
community organizations and the remaining 11% by NGOs and VDCs themselves. A survey on
perceptions in the two target districts noted found that 20% of the population believed user
committees to be most responsible for the quality of local roads.30

                                              Box 5: User Committees
    LBs can implement the approved project either directly, by contracting out, or via user committees (UCs).
    The formation, operation, management and implementation of UCs are provided for in the LSGA and further
    regulated by the LBFAR and Resource Mobilization Procedures. Among the reasons for this implementation
    method are the remoteness of many project sites and corresponding lack of contractors; and to mobilize
    project beneficiaries to contribute cash and labor, thereby increasing local ownership. However, UCs are often
    employed even in cities where there are contractors.
    UCs are formed by an assembly of users at the project site in the presence of LB officials or designated social
    mobilizers. The assembly is supposed to record the involved households and create a UC with 7 to 11
    members, of which 33% must be women. Field studies suggest that formation rules are not always followed
    and with political leaders playing a leading role rather than users.
    UCs are authorized to carry out programs of up to six million rupees (roughly US$ 60,000). Funds of more
    than 50,000 rupees must be held in a bank account which is jointly operated by the UC chair person, secretary
    and treasurer, requiring each of their signatures. The UC is required to mobilize cash and/or in-kind labor
    from the population to help fund the project cost. UC officials are supposed to receive training on operations,
    accounting and construction.
    A roster of subject-wise UCs (e.g. for roads, water etc.) has to be maintained by the LBs. The invitation
    notices published by LBs for UC applications and formation have to include information on basic cost and
    other relevant details. The UCs also have to disclose project progress reports and are subject to social audits.
    The LB’s supervision of the project implementation work carried out by UCs is generally limited.
    In practice, however, UCs are often not constituted as prescribed. In some cases, UCs may be dominated by
    political party representatives; in other cases, UCs act as ‘fronts’ for contractors. In addition, there are
    numerous reported cases of UCs acting in collusion with contractors and frequent reports of corruption and
    financial mismanagement by UCs. The integrity of UC social audits has also been called into question. 31 In
    addition, UCs – however representative and honest they are – have inherent technical limitations; despite this
    they are given implementation responsibilities for sometimes technically demanding activities. 32


78.     LBs’ financial reporting is fragmented. LB reporting is driven by the type of revenue which
is provided rather than providing a consolidated statement of revenues and expenditures. Moreover,
while standard formats have been issued, financial reports from various LBs follow a variety of
formats. Financial reports typically contain revenue sections divided up by revenue type (own source,
government grants, etc.) and corresponding expenditure sections. For this reason, financial reports
show for example VDC or DDC ‘recurrent grants’ as expenditures in some cases (while the
expenditures are on core administration salaries) or ‘land registration fees’. In most cases,
expenditures are listed by the name of the program, particularly in cases of funding from specific
program grants.

79.    There is currently no functional reporting on expenditures, i.e. by sector (education,
water supply, local roads etc.). To some degree this reflects the approach where LBs are only
expected to spend on development that is locally responsive without concern for specific sectors.

Sectoral focus can in some cases be inferred from the names of program expenditures but this is
usually not aggregated or systematized, even at the level of LBs. Instead, LBs’ expenditure statements
simply list hundreds of small ‘programs’. This practice of financial reporting currently does not allow
MoFALD or any other central government agency to assess how much LBs are spending on any given
sector. Line agencies such as the Ministry of Education also do not have a record of LBs’ financial
contributions to education. Even though the MoE’s semi-annual flash reports call for tracking these
contributions, they are typically left blank. Specific studies such as this one have been carried out to
ascertain this information, but as of yet there is no regular reporting mechanism to capture all funding
flows to schools. 33

80.    Financial reporting practices suggest that there is little, if any, joint funding from
multiple revenue sources for activities. For instance, the use of block grant funding for the
maintenance of a section of a local road and the use of own source revenue funds for the same road
would be treated as two different projects with two different cost centers.

81.     Accountability for the use of funds is similarly fragmented. For particular conditional
grants, such as those provided for specific roads, LBs have to report back to the funding source
(usually DoLIDAR). LBs are also required to report on own source revenues and shared taxes to the
Local Bodies Fiscal Commission housed in MoFALD. These reports contain an aggregate reporting
on grants only, without differentiating between conditional and unconditional grants.

82.      Delays in fund transfers present financial management challenges. There appears to be a
consistent delay in issuing authorization letters for fiscal transfers by the central government,
particularly for conditional grants for specific programs. VDCs face a specific challenge in accessing
funds due a requirement that district level LDOs accept trimester reports and authorize the release of
funds; LDOs typically will wait to group VDC disbursement requests before authorizing release from
the District Treasury & Comptroller’s Office. Issues with the timely receipt of funds can prompt less
sound management as LBs are under additional time pressure to absorb funds. Delays create an
incentive for LBs to move resources that have not been spent by the end of a FY to a ‘non-freezing’
account in order to avoid having to return unspent funds to the central treasury. Other coping
strategies for anticipated fund transfer delays include providing advances to user groups or
contractors, or pre-financing user group activities before final project approval. The delays make it
very challenging for LBs to efficiently utilized funds and follow financial management rules.

83.      Formal mechanisms to address fiduciary risk lack rigor and at times are not applied.
LBs are required to have a Fiduciary Risks Reduction Action Plan (FRRAP) for managing their funds,
but this appears to be a pro forma exercise, if at all conducted. There is no effective mechanism to
check compliance with these plans. Municipalities and DDCs have an internal audit section, with the
DDC audit section also responsible for carrying out internal audits of VDCs. In the two districts
reviewed in this study not all VDCs were audited owing to capacity constraints. DDCs are subject to
an external audit by the Auditor General’s Office while municipalities and VDCs are to hire an
independent registered auditor approved by the municipal council and the DDC, respectively.34 Audit
reports are to be tabled in the respective LB accounts committee and in their council meetings, but
there is little practice of following up on audit findings. Although detailed procedural guidelines for
public/social audits and public hearings on use of funds have been issued, only a few LBs reportedly
comply with these guidelines.

84.     The budgeting and financial reporting system limits LB accountability. There are strong
regulations mandating transparency in LBs’ as well as in UCs’ operations, but there are apparent
issues of compliance and fiduciary probity. Moreover, when reporting is available such as was
observed in Dhankuta and Dhanusa, it consists of a list of projects and levels of financing. This limits


33
     The Department of Education is planning to require such reporting in the next fiscal year 2014/2015.
34
     An audit bill presently in Parliament calls for all LB audits to be conducted by the OAG.

accountability and more strategic decision-making about prioritizing among sectors or among projects
within sectors.35

85.      Public trust in LBs is moderate in Dhankuta but low in Dhanusa. Surveys in Dhankuta
and Dhanusa shows levels of trust in local bodies which are, on aggregate, slightly lower than they are
for most other public institutions (including the police, DEO, district administration). There is
substantial difference between the districts. In Dhankuta, citizens have as much, if not more, trust in
their local bodies as they do in other public institutions; some 80% of the citizens interviewed in
Dhankuta regard their VDCs as either moderately or very trustworthy and only 2.5% regard them as
not trustworthy at all. In Dhanusa, on the other hand, there is less citizen trust in all public institutions,
but LBs are rated particularly poorly: only 52.5% of respondents regard their VDCs as moderately or
very trustworthy, while almost 20% regard their VDCs as not trustworthy at all. Citizen distrust of
local bodies in Dhanusa resonates with deficient PFM and financial reporting practices that this study
found in the district.36

C. Functional Assignments

86.    The normative basis for the assignment of functions and responsibilities across Nepal’s
intergovernmental system is defined by a number of regulatory or policy instruments, inter alia:
        The LSGA (1999), which sets out the ‘functions, duties and powers’ of each type of LB. This
         is the key law that provides for Nepal’s system of sub-national government and is the starting
         point for identifying sub-national functional assignments.
        The Local Infrastructure Development Policy (LIDP, 2004), which provides a broad
         framework for the management of local (as opposed to national) infrastructure.
        MoFALD regulations and guidelines. Of these, the most important in terms of assigning
         responsibilities are the 2012 Local Body Resource Mobilization and Operation Management
         Guidelines, which provide LBs with guidance as to how they are expected to spend both own
         source revenues and grants/transfers from central government.
        Various Acts specific to key infrastructure and service delivery sectors (e.g. the Education
         Act of 1971, most recently amended in 2001), which provide the legal framework for their
         respective sectors.
        The Government of Nepal (Allocation of Business) Rules (2008, amended in 2009), issued by
         the Council of Ministers. In effect, these rules allocate governmental responsibilities among
         all national ministries.

The table on the following page summarizes the developmental and service delivery functions
assigned to different types of LB in the LSGA and the Government Allocation of Business Rules.37A
detailed description of the large number of functions assigned to LBs by the LSGA may be found in
Annex 3.




35
   For this reason efforts to conduct budget hearings in local jurisdictions have been challenged to produce
budget-in-brief documents showing expenditures by sector.
36
   See Annex 5
37
   These are set out in LSGA Article 26 (for VDCs), LSGA Article 96 (for Municipalities) and LSGA Article
188 (for DDCs).

87.      Local bodies have been assigned a wide range of functions. As per the LGSA, LBs are
expected to assume some kind of responsibility for most key service delivery sectors. In that sense,
the LSGA provides LBs with an ambitious service delivery agenda and enables LBs to intervene – in
one way or another – in virtually all sectors38. This is somewhat constrained by the Local Body
Resource Mobilization and Operation Management Guidelines (RMOMG), issued by MoFALD in
201339, which limit exactly what LBs can finance in the functional areas for which they have
normative responsibilities. In the education sector, for example, the RMOMG appears to prohibit LBs
from financing recurrent costs (such as salaries for contract teachers) even though this proscription is
not part of the LSGA’s provisions.

88.     But there is ambiguity about what this means in terms of actual responsibility. For
example, VDCs are expected to ‘supervise and manage the schools being operated within the village
development area’ – which leaves open the question of what ‘manage’ means. Does school
management by VDCs imply that VDCs are expected to finance schools or hire teachers? This does
not occur and government rules indicate otherwise, yet it would appear that the LBs are supposed to
engage in management of local schools. This formulation and resulting ambiguity is repeated for a
large number of public services, including such areas as health, agriculture, and transport. (see table 3
above and Annex 3)

89.     Most functions assigned to LBs by the LSGA are voluntary. With the partial exception of
municipalities, there is no indication of whether functional responsibilities are exclusively to be
carried out by LBs, whether tasks within a function are shared, or if LBs in fact have no responsibility
for outcomes. Given that the overall legislative framework shows a de facto sharing, it is not clear
from the law what LBs are required to do and how this fits with line agencies’ responsibilities. The
absence of mandatory assignments suggests that LBs have broad discretion to do as they see fit
without explicit responsibility for outcomes or service levels. There is greater clarity in cases where
LBs carry out delegated tasks for which conditional financing is provided. The situation is somewhat
different for municipalities where the LSGA specifies that functions and duties are to be performed
‘mandatorily’ although the description of functions is expansive and does not appear to correspond to
municipalities’ resources and de facto practices.

90.      Although LSGA functional assignments often do demarcate the respective
responsibilities of DDCs, VDCs and municipalities, there remains considerable overlap among
LBs. With respect to social protection, for example, DDCs (for their ‘women and helpless people’
function) and VDCs (as a ‘miscellaneous’ duty) appear to have almost identical functions. The same
can be said of DDC and VDC/municipal responsibilities with respect to agriculture, education, health
and the environment. MoFALD issued a Local Infrastructure Development Policy (LIDP) in 2004
which does indeed provide a more consistent demarcation between national and sub-national
infrastructure, but it does not assign specific and discrete infrastructure responsibilities to DDCs,
VDCs and Municipalities. The local planning process, as prescribed by the LSGA, also tends to blur
DDC and VDC functional assignments. While VDCs initially plan and then take on what they can at
their level, they also ‘forward’ proposals to DDCs through the 14-step planning process, many of
which would normally be considered to be VDC responsibilities. These may or may not be accepted
by DDCs as part of their plans – which will (or will not) then finance the implementation of such
activities or schemes.

91.      The LSGA is not explicit regarding two key functions that LBs do play in practice: vital
events registration and a share of responsibilities for social security payments. Vital events
registration is categorized by the LSGA as a ‘miscellaneous’ function for both VDCs and
municipalities, although it is exclusively carried out by the LBs and one of the most recognizable

38
   This is not unique to Nepal. In many francophone African countries, for example, laws specify a very broad
set of functions for local governments. The same applies to Bangladesh, where Union Parishads are assigned a
wide range of functions.
39
   The RMOMG superseded earlier and separate guidelines for VDCs, municipalities and DDCs.
 


public services provided by LBs to the population. The delegated management of social security
payments – identification of beneficiaries per national criteria and delivery of the benefits (e.g.
pensions and widows allowances) – is also categorized as a ‘miscellaneous’ VDC function and not
defined as a municipal function, although carried out by municipalities.

92.      Functional assignments to LBs follow a principle of ‘supplementarity’ to line agencies
rather than subsidiarity. While the LSGA provides LBs with a wide range of functional
responsibilities, the overwhelming majority of the same responsibilities are also assigned to line
ministries. A recent fiscal decentralization stocktaking study40 notes that although 23 sector laws were
originally identified as conflicting with the LSGA, few have been amended to take into account LB
functional responsibilities. The Government’s Allocation of Business Rules (2008) make it clear that
major line ministries (such as the Ministry of Education or Ministry of Health and Population)
continue to be responsible for the provision of the same sector services as are assigned to LBs by the
LSGA. In sum, overall institutional arrangements with respect to functional assignments are not
internally consistent.

93.      Even in cases where line ministries have tried to align themselves with decentralization
policies, there remains functional ambiguity. Primary education, for example, was defined as a
devolved sector in 2002, for which the Ministry of Education drew up sector devolution guidelines.
The guidelines, however, did little to make LBs genuinely responsible for primary education; instead,
and consistent with previous primary education policies, School Management Committees (SMCs)
and District Education Offices (DEOs) continued to be the principal managers of the primary
education sector, with DDCs, VDCs and municipalities playing a largely symbolic role as chairs of
their respective education committees. Managing funds for primary education also continued to be
seen as a MoE/DEO responsibility. Even where funds for primary education have been channeled
through DDCs (as is the case for the salaries of primary school teachers), this has not implied any
meaningful involvement of DDCs in planning and budgeting; instead, the DDCs simply operate as an
additional layer in the fund flow and bureaucratic process for the primary education sector41.

94.      In the case of functions (or services) assigned to them by the LSGA and which are not
undertaken or provided by other institutions, LBs appear to meet their responsibilities. This is
notably the case for vital events and civil registration, which are typically local government functions,
for which they are exclusively responsible and accountable. Moreover, vital events and civil
registration are seen as key functions and expected by local populations – without official birth and
marriage certificates, for example, it is technically impossible to obtain Nepali citizenship, without
which children are not admitted into public schools and the old age are not entitled to non-
contributory pensions.

95.       Where LBs are provided with earmarked grants or transfers, they take on the
associated functional responsibilities.42 This is most obviously the case for social protection and
cash transfers. On a delegated basis, VDCs and municipalities administer the vast majority of the
government’s cash transfer programs (old age pensions, widows’ allowances, child grants, grants for
disadvantaged households, etc.), using social security grants or transfers from MoFALD. The only
major exception to this is the administration and management of scholarships – a form of conditional
cash transfer – which are handled by schools and funded out of grants from the Ministry of Education.
This is also the case for a variety of local infrastructure responsibilities, especially local roads, for
which LBs often receive conditional grants from MoFALD. DDCs, in particular, are provided with
substantial funds (in the form of conditional grants) for the maintenance and/or improvement of
district-level road networks. The provision of such conditional grants ensures that LBs meet (some of)
their assigned infrastructural responsibilities.

   This would appear to be a good example of ‘finance following functions’ – although it could be argued that,
in practice, this is a case of ‘function following finance’.

96.     LBs use their discretionary resources for a wide range of activities. Discretionary funds
are own source revenues, shared revenues and block grants. Although the recent RMOM Guidelines
require LBs to spend at least 35% of their block grant allocations on targeting certain categories of
beneficiaries (women, children, and disadvantaged groups such as Dalits) and a minimum of 60% on
the development of economic and social infrastructure, they do not include sector-specific spending
requirements (see the section on intergovernmental fiscal transfers, paras 113 onwards, below for a
description of transfers). Observers have identified five reasons for this practice of diffuse spending
on small infrastructure projects43:
     Resource constraints that make it implausible to try to address many of the formal functional
      assignments;
     The broadness of the legal framework permits LBs to pick and choose from a wide range of
      public sector functions;
     The planning process is open-ended and appears to be driven towards providing for a large
      number of small projects to satisfy many constituencies rather than just a few strategic ones;
     Preference for small capital projects which are visible, even if this is not necessarily what
      would be most important for the particular service;
     Lower importance of supporting areas where there already is significant financing via line
      agencies even if it is a local function.

97.      The broad functional framework means that the accountability framework for local
government focuses on allocation of funding (inputs) rather than service delivery (outputs and
outcomes). Outside of vital events registration and where there are delineated tasks such as social
protection and the local road network, LBs are not clearly responsible for any public services. In
particular, they are not responsible for ensuring delivery of services or making decisions about the
quantity or quality of these services. LBs may take on such a role, but there is little legal impetus to
do so. Accountability arises rather in the process of allocating and providing financing in a manner
that meets local demands for small projects. The large degree of discretion means that LBs – in effect
the VDC secretary, EO, or LDO – can cater to the needs and demands as formulated in localities.

Local Bodies Functions in Practice

98.     It is difficult to ascertain aggregate spending patterns which would give an indication of
LBs’ de facto functions. Available consolidated fiscal reporting at the central level provides minimal
characteristics of expenditures. It must be noted that the below proportions are based on reports on the
use of centrally provided transfers, i.e. conditional and unconditional grants. Expenditures from own
source revenues and shared taxes are not included. The following can be drawn from those reports:
     High levels of capital expenditure, but with a decline as a proportion of total expenditures from
      80% in 2010/11 to 67% in 2012/13;
     Cash transfers for social benefits through the LBs have increased by approx. 900% between
      2007/08 and 2011/12, now comprising nearly one-third of LBs’ expenditures;
     For municipalities, where more data is available, average recurrent expenditures were 25%, but
      with some outliers as high as 51%; the seven largest municipalities (out of 58) account for 49%
      of all recurrent municipal expenditures, while the five largest municipalities account for 36% of
      total recorded capital expenditure.44

99.      Expenditure patterns in LBs in the two case districts demonstrate a broad range of LBs’
activities. A functional breakdown of VDC expenditures in Dhankuta district is provided in Figure 3.
This figure was derived by looking at the detailed lists of scores of small mostly capital projects in the
five VDCs where such detailed expenditures could be captured. Record-keeping in the VDCs in
Dhanusa district was not sufficiently comprehensive to construct reliably a composite picture of

expenditures by function. See Annexes 1 and 6 for a detailed breakdown of expenditures and the
methodology for compiling sectoral or functional grouping of expenditures.

100.   VDC expenditure patterns in Dhankuta are dominated by social security payments,
administrative costs and support for maintenance of local roads. Key features of VDC budgets
are:
    Overall, administrative costs, social security payments and local roads account for about 60%
     of the expenditures. The remaining 40% is spread out across a large number of sectors –
     education, water & sanitation, community infrastructure, agriculture, electrification,
     environment, health, police stations, temples and miscellaneous activities.
    A significant proportion (30-35%) of VDC expenditure is accounted for by social security
     payments (pensions, widows’ allowances, etc). This is in line with earmarked grants to VDCs
     for social security and the exclusive mandate of VDCs to administer such cash transfers.
    Spending on the construction and maintenance of local roads is also an important part (roughly
     15%) of overall VDC expenditure. Financed out of block grants, spending on local roads is
     both a response to demand and a reflection of VDCs’ mandate and the absence of other
     agencies to finance such activities.

                            Figure 3: Dhankuta VDCs sector spending 2009-12




101.     From the expenditure data for Dhankuta VDCs it can be seen that allocations are
further fragmented within sectors. Given that average annual expenditure among the Dhankuta
VDCs is a little under NPR 4 million (US$ 40,000), the absolute amounts spent on many of these
sectors are relatively small. Detailed expenditure statements for VDCs45 show that:
    VDCs tend to spend small amounts on discrete projects or activities. In 2009/10, Pakhribas
      VDC, for example, spent a total of NPR 580,000 on local roads, divided up into seven discrete
      projects, the largest of which cost NPR 300,000 and the smallest of which cost NPR 30,000;
    VDC spending outside of social security and administration tends to be on small scale
      infrastructure or capital items (e.g. construction of school facilities, repairing irrigation canals);

45
     Detailed expenditure statements for some VDCs in Dhankuta district are included in Annex 6.

                                                       32
 


      VDC spending in sectors like basic education (which receives substantial ministry funding) is
       on items that are peripheral, such as building walls around schools or school playgrounds.

102.     Municipal expenditure is similarly fragmented, although limited data shows more
spending on local roads. Dhankuta municipality, for which fairly complete data on expenditures was
collected, spent about 15% of its 2010/11 and 2011/12 budgets on administration and social security.
Spending on local roads accounted for almost 40% of total expenditure and the remaining 45% was
spent on education, health, water supply, solid waste management and a range of other sectors and
sub-sectors.46 Moreover, expenditure items are typically small (see the local roads chapter below for
details on the small size of roads projects).

103.    The same eclectic patterns of spending are seen at the DDC level. Figure 4 provides a
graphic summary of Dhanusa DDC’s development spending in 2010/1147. Although spending on the
local roads and bridges sectors is important, accounting for roughly one third of the DDC’s total
development expenditure, the DDC was also involved in providing significant funding for education,
water & sanitation, livelihoods, community buildings, and religious buildings (for which expenditure
was over ten times greater than for DDC spending in the health sector).

                       Figure 4: Dhanusa DDC expenditure 2010/11 by sector




104.    Dhanusa DDC also allocates funds to a very large number of often small items within
each sector48. Moreover, many of the DDC’s expenditure items (such as spending on primary or
lower secondary schools or spending on community buildings) might normally be VDC
responsibilities – illustrating the extent to which functional assignments across tiers of the local
government system may overlap in practice.

   See Annex 6 for a detailed expenditure statement for Dhankuta municipality.

   The development section comprises most capital funding in the budget. Detailed expenditures that could be
classified by function were only available for this part of the budget and only in Dhanusa.

105.    Public perceptions about service delivery responsibilities correspond to de facto LB
areas of focus. In the education sector, for example, about 65% of survey respondents claimed that
they see SMCs, DEOs and MoE as responsible for the quality of education, while less than 15% of
respondents hold local bodies or local education committees responsible. The responsibility of local
education institutions is further reflected in the overwhelming public perception that it is to them that
complaints about the quality of education services should be addressed. In the local roads sector, on
the other hand, just over 70% of respondents identify local bodies as being primarily responsible for
the quality of infrastructure, with a further 20% attributing this to UCs. These institutions are also the
ones to which the public feels that any complaints about local roads should be addressed.49

106.     LBs are not necessarily focusing on citizens’ highest priorities for public services, but
rather in areas where they are expected (or required by conditional transfers) to deliver. In
terms of local public services, citizens in both districts accord the highest priority to education and
health. Almost 90% of respondents in Dhankuta and Dhanusa perceived these two services to be very
or extremely important. Local roads were the third overall highest priority, rated as very or extremely
important by just over 80% of respondents. These three sectors were all seen as more important than
water & sanitation (75% finding it very or extremely important), electrification (61%) and vital/civil
registration (62%). This appears to reflect a de facto division of labor between LBs and line
departments, rather than a lack of responsiveness.50

D. The Intergovernmental Fiscal Framework

107.     Nepal’s intergovernmental fiscal framework is marked by a concentration of revenues
at the central level, a complex system of transfers to LBs and an overall increase in recent years
of LBs’ discretionary and non-discretionary revenues. The total expenditure of LBs as a
percentage of central government expenditure has increased six-fold between 2006/07 to 2012/13,
entirely due to substantial increases in intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Transfers to LBs made up 9
- 12% of total central government expenditures in the last three fiscal years ending FY 2012.51

Revenue Assignments

108.     Major sources of revenue such as VAT, income tax or excise duties are collected
nationally while LBs are assigned small, mostly so-called ‘nuisance’ taxes. VDCs and
municipalities have eight local taxes apiece. This includes a ‘rent and tenancy’ property tax, which
can be significant where there is substantial agricultural land, such as in the Terai. However, its
collection is limited and is hampered by issues with maintaining a proper cadastre. VDCs and
municipalities can also charge a range of service fees and license fees. Notably, outside of two cities
in Kathmandu Valley no LB charges fees for solid waste collection. DDCs have four minor taxes and
the right to levy service fees. LBs do not have authority to set tax rates or bases. There are generally
not enough trained personnel for tax collection nor are there effective enforcement mechanisms for
local taxes. See Annex 4 for a breakdown of revenue assignments.

109.     Own source revenues (OSR) are a small and shrinking proportion of the total revenue of
LBs. In FY 2006/07, OSR52 were around 17.5% and grants made up around 60% of the total revenue.
In FY 2012/13, OSR saw a decrease to 13%, while the central government’s grant transfer increased
to 83% of the total revenue.53 For example, OSR as a proportion of total municipality revenue has
been declining from 33% of total municipal revenues in FY 2006/07 to 18% in FY 2010/11. This
decrease in OSR as a proportion of total revenues is largely due to the substantial increase in fiscal
transfers, as local OSR has in fact tripled over the same period.

                        Figure 6: LB own source revenue for FYs 2006-2012




110.     There are large variations in own source revenue potential and collection among LBs.
The 58 municipalities collect roughly half of all LB own source revenues, while the nearly 3,915
VDCs take in only 20% in total. A small number of DDCs in Kathmandu Valley and the Terai receive
significant income from sand and gravel sales, which functions as a kind of excise tax on the transport
of these. Similarly, the OSR collected by VDCs in aggregate in 10 districts accounts for more than
20% of total VDC revenues, while, on the other hand, in the majority of districts (57 out of 75), OSR
accounts for less than 10% of total VDC revenues.54

111.    A large proportion of DDC and municipal OSR comes from user charges and fees. In FY
2011/12, tax revenue in municipalities was only 41% of the total municipal OSR, while the remaining
share came from non-tax revenues, service fees being the largest contributor with 42% of the total
OSR. Similarly, in DDCs around 55% of the total DDC OSR is generated from tax, the remaining

52
   This includes shared revenue of VDCs as disaggregated data was not available for VDCs.

percentage is generated from non-tax revenue. Income from taxing sales (of sand, boulders, wood,
etc.) is the second largest revenue source and highest non-tax contributor to DDC budgets.

                 Figure 7: Composition of Municipality and DDC own source revenue




112.    The LSGA provides for vertical and horizontal revenue sharing between center and
local government or among local governments. The types of shared revenues are outlined in Annex
4. Of these revenues, the most important is the house and land registration fee shared between DDCs
and the central government: in FY 2011/12 it accounted for one third of DDCs’ OSR and shared
revenues combined. However, the share of the income from registration fees flowing back to DDCs is
capped at 6 million NPR (about US$60,000).

Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers (Grants and Social Payments)

113.     Conditional grants are transfers from central government agencies for specific
recurrent or capital expenses. LBs are required to specifically report on the expenditures under each
such conditional grant to ensure that they are meeting the criteria set by the central agency allocating
the grant. Central agencies run multiple programs involving conditional grants to LBs and separate
expenditure reporting for each program. Conditional grants make up a large part of LBs’ budgets.
This is one of the reasons why major parts of financial reporting are done by revenue source55. The
largest type of conditional grant in terms of budget is social benefit transfers, which are administered
by LBs. The second largest conditional grant is for local infrastructure, usually provided via the
Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR) in MoFALD.

114.     Unconditional grants, usually referred to as block grants in Nepal, provide largely
discretionary revenue. There are capital block grants and recurrent block grants to be spent on staff
and core administration costs. As for the capital block grant, LBs are required to spend a minimum
proportion of it on project activities that benefit certain historically disadvantaged segments of the
population, in that sense limiting the LBs’ discretion. The capital block grant comprises of two
components:
    i) Minimum grant: LBs receive an annual ‘minimum block grant’ for capital expenditures; VDCs
         receive between NPR 1.5 million and 3 million depending on criteria such as population or
         poverty levels, while DDCs all receive a flat amount of NPR 3 million;
    ii) Formula based MC/PM grant: in addition to the minimum block grant, LBs may be provided
         with an additional grant dependent on the fulfillment of meeting certain minimum
         requirements (e.g. proper financial management) and performance measures, trying to
         incentivize compliance with legal provisions and good performance.

115.     Per capita grant allocations vary considerably from one local body to another.
Unconditional grants are driven by formulae that are specifically intended to give weight to poverty,
land area and local costs, as well as population. However, the ‘equal shares’ component means that
per capita allocations will be higher in smaller local bodies56. In addition, per capita conditional grant
allocations – which are not allocated on the basis of any formula – are also variable: Dhankuta DDC,
for example, received in FY 2012 a per capita conditional grant allocation (about NPR 1,500) that was
over ten times greater than Dhanusa (about NPR 120).

116.     Municipalities and VDCs exercise substantial discretion over about half of their
revenues; DDCs have less such discretion. This is despite the fact that social payments via VDC and
municipal budgets have increased faster than any other recorded revenue in local budgets. National
financial statements for the FY 2012/13 (the ‘Red Book’) show that unconditional grants, conditional
grants, and social benefit transfers make up 40%, 35%, and 25% respectively of all transfers. If one
takes that proportion and applies it to the proportion of ‘grants’ reported in the Local Bodies Fiscal
Commission on OSRs, then roughly 34% of LBs’ revenues are largely discretionary block grants and
another 15% are fully discretionary OSRs. 57 It would appear based on available national level data
that the proportion of discretionary spending is even higher at the VDC and municipality level.
Whereas overall for LBs unconditional grants make up 40% of the total transfers, they made up only
20% of total transfers to DDCs. A breakdown below DDCs is not available but it appears logical that
VDCs and municipalities would have discretion over somewhat more than 50% of all revenues.

Data Sources:
OSR, Shared Revenue = LBFC 2013

117.    Data for Dhankuta58 reflect the nation-wide breakdown of discretionary versus non-
discretionary revenues. In Dhankuta VDCs enjoy discretionary powers over about 60% of their total
revenues. VDCs typically receive only one conditional grant, for social security; other transfers are
almost exclusively recurrent or capital block grants, over which they have substantial discretion.

56
   See Boex (2012).
57
   Figures for grants in LBFC’s data differ from those of central transfers in the Red Book. This means that
combination of proportions of central government transfers as per the Red Book with records of central grants
received by LBs mixes data that does not match. However, the proportions derived from the Red Book provide a
rough sense of scale between various types of conditional and unconditional transfers received by LBs.
58
   Revenue data for VDCs in Dhanusa is too inconsistent to be analysed.

                               LOCAL ROADS AND PRIMARY EDUCATION

A. Local Roads

Normative Institutional Framework

118.     Local body functional responsibilities in the local roads sector are specified in several
legal, regulatory and policy documents. The Local Self Governance Act (LSGA, 1999) spells out
LB functional assignments, which include local roads and transport infrastructure. The LSGA also
specifies that concerned line ministries are expected to assist LBs in the planning and implementation
of their development programs. LSGR (2000) and LBFAR (2007) provide more detailed operational
and financial management rules, applicable to all LB activities (including those related to the local
roads sector). Finally, the Local Infrastructure Development Policy (LIDP, 2004) assigns
responsibilities to LBs in seven local infrastructure sub-sectors, including local roads and transport.
The LIDP further classifies local infrastructure as village level, municipal level and district level
(without actually providing much detail on precisely what types of infrastructure correspond to which
level).

119.    The Public Roads Act (PRA) of 1974 remains the principal legal framework for the
roads sector as a whole. Although the PRA is no longer up to date, a range of more recent policy
documents have tried to address issues related to the roads sector – notably the National Transport
Policy (2002) which classifies the local transport system as consisting of district roads, village roads,
agriculture roads, municipal roads and major foot trails, for which planning, construction and
maintenance are LB responsibilities.

120.     This normative institutional framework for the roads sector is internally not fully
consistent. The Department of Roads and DoLIDAR, for example, use different definitions for
classifying roads and assign responsibilities for their management to different institutions. The
harmonization and rationalization of the overall policy framework for the roads sector is a priority at
present for DoLIDAR59. This is further complicated by the often low levels of LB compliance with
policies, regulations and guidelines. This appears to be particularly marked in the local roads sector.

121.     There are several key national and sub-national institutional stakeholders in the local
roads sector60. At the center, the National Planning Commission (NPC) provides policy and
budgetary directives; the Ministry of Finance allocates resources and authorizes the release of
budgets, grants and transfers; MoFALD and DoLIDAR provide guidance and support to LBs with
respect to their activities in the local roads sector; the Roads Board provides funding for local roads
maintenance; and, finally, the Department of Roads (DoR) also directly undertakes local roads
activities.

122.    At the sub-national level, DDCs, VDCs and municipalities are responsible for the
planning, prioritization and implementation of local roads within nationally set guidelines. Local
roads sector activities are planned and undertaken according to the generic planning and
implementation procedures for LBs (paras 65 onwards above). However, the authority of LBs
(especially DDCs) in the sector is limited by conditions attached to earmarked roads sector funding.
In some cases work on local roads is carried out separately by the Department of Roads. District
Technical Offices (DTOs in DDCs are expected to provide all LBs with technical support. In practice,
they tend to direct their limited capacity to district level roads and to GoN and donor-funded sector
programs. The construction and maintenance of local roads are dominated by user committees (UCs)
except for DoR roads, which are usually given to private contractors.

Local Roads: An Overview

123.     The roads sector in Nepal is divided between the Strategic Road Network (SRN), which
includes national highways and feeder roads, and the Local Road Network (LRN). All roads
outside of the SRN are automatically local roads. Although estimates vary, the LRN consists of at
least 50,000 km of roads. Only 5% of local roads are paved. Most paved roads are situated in the
relatively flat Terai region, where the majority of other local roads are graveled. In the Middle Hills,
on the other hand, there are few paved roads and most local roads are earthen. The overall consensus
is that over half of all local roads are inoperable.

                              Box 6: Local road networks in Dhankuta and Dhanusa
    Dhankuta: the current road network in Dhankuta district consists of a total of 1,010.5 km of registered roads; in
    addition, there are estimated to be about 500 km of unregistered roads. Of this, 119 km are strategic roads,
    538.1 km make up the District Road Core Network (DRCN, which link up the VDCs and Dhankuta
    municipality) and 353.4 km are village roads. Less than 1% of the DRCN consists of paved roads; the vast
    majority of DRCN and village roads are earthen. Only 20% of DRCN roads and 5% of village roads are
    considered to be ‘all weather’ (i.e. usable throughout the year, including the monsoon season); the remainder
    are only ‘fair weather’ (i.e. unusable in poor weather conditions).
    Dhanusa: the existing registered road network in Dhanusa district consists of just over 177 km of strategic
    roads, about 505 km of district level roads (making up the DRCN), and 427 km of village or municipal roads.
    A little over 5% of the DRCN is paved, 30% is graveled and about 65% is earthen. The vast majority of
    registered village or municipal roads are earthen. 65% of the DRCN is classified as being in poor condition and
    35% is classified as being ‘all-weather’, the remainder (65%) being ‘fair weather’.

Local Roads: Planning and Implementation in Practice

124.    In practice, the ways in which local roads sector activities are planned and implemented
by LBs appear to vary according to the source of funding. Where LBs rely on their own source, or
shared revenues, and unconditional block grants (for which they enjoy a good deal of discretion with
respect to the use of such funds), LBs appear to follow the ‘generic’ planning and implementation
framework. In these cases, the overall priority accorded to the local roads sector (in relation to other
sectors) and to specific roads sector projects are identified through a combination of bottom-up
planning and council decision-making. In all types of LB, roads sector spending funded out of own
source, shared and block grant revenues is a relatively high priority.

125.     At the VDC-level, considerable priority appears to be given to spending on local roads.
As can be seen from figure 9, VDC spending (in Dhankuta district) in the local roads & bridges sector
accounts for 4-24% of annual expenditure. Taken over a three-year period (2009-12), the VDCs in
Dhankuta spent just over 14% of their total budgets on the local roads sector. Local roads are the third
largest spending category for the VDCs, after social security transfers and administrative costs.




                                                          39
 


                      Figure 9: Roads and other sector spending by VDCs




126.    DDCs appear to give the local roads sector a higher spending priority than VDCs in
their use of discretionary revenues. Dhankuta DDC, for example, spent just under a third of its
block grant resources on the local roads sector between 2009 and 2011; indeed, the roads/bridges
sector was the largest sector in terms of spending (see figure 10 below).

                   Figure 10: Dhanusa DDC block grant spending by sector




127.     Municipalities appear to place an even greater emphasis on the local roads sector. In
Dhankuta municipality, for example, spending on the local roads sector accounts for almost 40% of
total annual expenditure (based on all revenues) and is by far the biggest spending sector.

                      Figure 11: Dhankuta – municipal expenditure by sector




128.    The annual roads sector planning process is supposed to be informed by District
Transport Master Plans (DTMPs). DTMPs are prepared by technically competent roads sector
planners, based on consultations with key local stakeholders, and approved by district councils.
DTMPs focus on District Road Core Networks (DRCNs) and do not apply to village or municipal
roads. DTMPs accord a high priority to maintenance and a low priority to the construction of new
roads. The selection of which DTMP elements are to be funded each year is integrated into the regular
annual DDC planning process. Up until recently, however, DDCs have paid limited attention to their
DTMPs61 – which have generally been used as a framework for national roads sector programs, often
funded by donors.

129.     Data from Dhankuta and Dhanusa indicate that local roads sector activities funded out
of discretionary resources follow the same pattern whereby LBs spread resources among a large
number of projects. Planning for the roads sector is part of the standard LB planning process
discussed in paras 65 onwards. The result is that spending on the local roads sector is spread out over
a large number of individual projects for all types of LBs. These are typically small given that (a) the
local fiscal budget is of limited size and (b) local councils and officials are under pressure to satisfy as
many constituents as possible. In the VDCs, DDCs and municipalities surveyed, this tendency –
described as the ‘sprinkler effect’ by a recent study62 – is readily apparent in the large number and
small size of roads sector projects (see table 4 below). The average cost of VDC roads sector projects
(of all types) is about NPR 122,000 (US$1,200),which is very small; Dhanusa DDC and Dhankuta
municipality have larger projects, but these still cost remarkably little (on average less than NPR
550,000).




61
   This now appears to be changing, as the government and its development partners have begun to insist that
annual planning and implementation of local roads activities by DDCs be strictly guided by DTMPs.

130.     Local bodies do not appear to be engaging in the local roads sector in a strategic or
systematic way. Rather than trying to maintain or upgrade entire stretches of the local roads network,
LBs tend to take an approach of satisfying a range of local stakeholders (communities, UCs, political
leaders, etc.), who may have parochial interests rather than a vision of the local roads network as a
public good. Although most DDCs now have updated DTMPs, which potentially provide a coherent
framework to guide investments and activities in the local roads sector, these do not appear to be
rigorously adhered to given the local context (as Box 7 below illustrates). VDCs, on the other hand,
have no strategic document for the local roads sector. This leaves them more vulnerable to parochial
interest groups, and limits their ability to look at their road networks as a whole.

        Box 7: Dhankuta DDC’s current approach to the local roads sector: ‘Everybody gets something’
    For the coming FY (2014/15), the DDC in Dhankuta intends to allocate about NPR 22 million to the local
    roads sector, to be financed out of the DDC’s unconditional block grant and from conditional grants.
    According to the DTO, the allocation of funds to individual road projects will be consistent with the DTMP,
    which was updated in 2013; priority will be given to maintenance and road improvements, rather than to new
    construction. Allocations will be limited to work on the district’s 22 DRCN roads, each of which has its own
    UC. The district council will meet to decide on how to allocate these funds – both the LDO and the head of the
    DTO agree that allocations from the overall roads envelope are almost certain to be made to everybody, in
    other words to all 22 UCs (but with some variations in the amount allocated, depending on ‘difficulties’ with
    certain UCs). Doing otherwise, the LDO and DTO head argued, would create problems with local
    stakeholders. Once the sub-allocations are made, the DTO and respective UC will discuss the exact nature and
    location of the works to be undertaken.

Conditional Financing and Other Fund Flows for Roads

131.     DDCs also receive more tightly earmarked conditional grants for the local roads sector
from the government and donors. During the period 2009-2012, Dhankuta DDC, for example, has
received separate grants for agricultural roads, for bridges, for local transportation, and for road
maintenance. These leave the DDC with little discretion as to their use – either in terms of locality or
activity. Moreover, some of these conditional grants appear not to have been budgeted for, suggesting
that they were allocated on an ad hoc basis and outside of the DDC’s regular planning and budgeting
cycle. These diverse, unpredictable and typically ad hoc sources of funding do not foster a strategic
approach to the planning and management of the local roads sector. In such cases, local planning may
be limited in practice.

132.    End of year budget reallocations are important. During the third trimester of each FY, the
Ministry of Finance reallocates budgets from projects or activities that are likely to remain unspent
before the end of the FY to ‘new’ projects or activities. Such reallocated budgets are often channeled
through DDCs to finance earmarked works in the local roads sector, even though they are (more often
than not) unplanned at the local level. This is a top-down process and does not follow any formal

                                                             42
 


national or local planning process. Given that these budget reallocations take place towards the end of
the FY and do not correspond to any regular planning or project preparation process, the roads
projects that are financed may be hastily implemented. It is often the case that UCs are created to
implement them quickly while limited levels of technical support and supervision are provided. As a
result, quality may be compromised.

133.     Municipalities have an additional specific reallocation mechanism. Unspent Local
Development Fee (LDF63) funds are allocated to municipalities on the basis of proposals (including
roads projects) that they submit to central government and which municipalities are willing to co-fund
out of their own source revenues or beneficiary contributions. These funds are so-called Jageda Kosh
(matching funds). These funds are allocated by a central level committee, chaired by the Secretary of
MoFALD and including representatives from MoF/FCGO and the Municipal Association. Operational
guidelines for the management and use of such funds are in place. Again, this can lead to ad hoc
planning.

134.    Rural Community Infrastructure Works (RCIW), a food-for-work program jointly
implemented by the GoN and WFP, also contributes to roads. RCIW includes an important local
roads component. At the DDC level, a separate technical wing (distinct from DTOs and DoLIDAR)
oversees RCIW implementation. Local roads planning under RCIW may or may not be consistent
with the wider DDC road sector planning process.

135.     MPs’ Constituency Development Funds of NPR 1 million apiece are often a source of
financing for the local roads sector.64 This is disbursed through DDCs as authorized by the MP.
DDC/DTO technicians are responsible for technical supervision of these projects. Given the limited
capacity of DTOs, road projects appear to be often implemented without detailed engineering design
and funds are released on a cost estimate basis. These roads projects are generally implemented
through UCs, often selected by MPs themselves. The sole accountability for these types of program
resides in the MPs, who are responsible for authorization. DDCs function like a post office for budget
release, although they are responsible for all related audit functions.

136.    The Department of Roads (DoR) also carries out works on the local road network,
though it is supposed to limit itself exclusively to the Strategic Roads Network. Financing for this
work comes via national budget heading 68/4/5/249, a heading that provides for specific local
development spending determined by the central government. This provides an opportunity for
national politicians and leaders to influence the selection of local roads sector projects that are
included in the NPC’s annual program book. There is no coordination mechanism between DoR and
LBs and in practice this occurs only if DDCs ask for the information.65 The amount of work on the
local roads network that is carried out by DoR varies from year to year and from place to place. In
Dhanusa, for example, DoR’s divisional office spent very little in 2010/11 (NPR 1.2 million) on local
roads, but spent over NPR 20 million on local roads in the following year (2011/12), representing
roughly 40% of its annual works budget.

137.     While funding for the local roads sector has increased, the financing arrangements do
not lend themselves to coherent planning and management of local road networks. Although LBs
can generally rely on their own, shared and block grant revenues – all of which are fairly predictable –
this is not the case for either conditional grants or the other funding/grant modalities described above.
Conditional grants, earmarked for the local roads sector, are often not predictable nor are they based
on a transparent formula. Instead, they appear to be allocated in a largely ad hoc fashion by central

63
   The Local Development Fee (LDF) is provided to municipalities by central government as compensation for
revenues previously mobilized through octroi taxes, which were abolished in order to comply with WTO
regulations. See Annex 4 for more discussion of LDF.
64
   MPs elected through proportional representation can allocate such funds to more than one district, up to a
maximum of 6 projects/ constituencies.

   According DTO in Dhankuta, field report.

government. There are also parallel sources of road sector funding and a number of ad hoc allocation
mechanisms, few of which are predictable.

Implementation Issues in Maintaining the Local Roads Network

138.    Persistent delays in the release of funds can undermine work in the local roads sector.
The late release of funds forces LBs to rush the implementation of local road works during the last
trimester, which may further compromise quality.

139.     LBs have limited technical capacity. The pool of qualified road engineers is relatively small
in size. Inherent capacity limitations are exacerbated by the ‘sprinkler effect’ in the local roads sector,
which results in a limited number of technical staff being spread thinly across a large number of
projects and activities. The problem is further complicated by the reliance on UCs, many of which
may have limited skills and other limitations requiring relatively frequent technical backstopping to
ensure minimum standards. Increasingly large conditional and unconditional grants have expanded
spending on the local roads sector – stretching still further local technical capacities. There is
currently a mismatch between spending on local roads and the technical capacity of LBs to properly
manage activities in the local roads sector.

140.     Quality of implementation of roads building, maintenance, and upgrading could be
improved. Although LBs can implement road sector projects through contractors, UCs or directly by
themselves, in practice the majority of local road projects are implemented through UCs (see box 5 on
UCs above). Leaving aside problems associated with the composition and management practices
associated with UCs, the LBs’ reliance on them to implement local roads works may result in reduced
quality. Whatever their benefit in terms of local participation and ownership, UCs often appear to
have limited capacity and technical skills to carry out quality road works.

141.     VDC level road projects in particular tend to be of limited quality. Detailed engineering
design is rare, costing is largely driven by the amount of money allocated (rather than on the basis of
design and bills of quantities), technical supervision is limited, and works are rarely completed within
the year.66 VDCs spend much of their budgets on local roads, accounting for by one assessment about
18% of all spending on local roads.67 VDCs can hire technical staff or share with other VDCs the
associated costs. But VDCs rarely appear to take on full-time engineers, even when they are making
significant investments in the local roads sector or funding large numbers of local roads projects.
While some VDCs do indeed share the cost of hiring overseers to monitor and supervise works, they
may have limited qualification and experience. A major challenge appears to be the lack of qualified
engineers available at the local level. DTOs are stretched too thin to be able to provide VDCs with
sufficient technical support for any sector, including the local roads sector.

142.     At the DDC level, local roads sector activities are also characterized by limited technical
inputs. Although the local roads sector absorbs about 6.7% of the total national budget, DoLIDAR
and DTO staffing levels remain modest. Less than 1,200 DoLIDAR/DTO technical and administrative
staff provide full-time support for the local roads sector (see table 5 below). This staffing pattern has
not been reviewed to determine whether it is compatible with the growing volume of work at both the
central and local levels. DTO staff is thus frequently over-stretched and unable to carry out pre-
feasibility or feasibility studies, even when these are mandatory. This is compounded by DTOs having
technical responsibilities for several local infrastructure sub-sectors (water supply, suspension
bridges, micro-hydropower, irrigation), in addition to local roads. This situation may lead to shortcuts
in the design and costing of roads works; and lack of proper supervision in construction, upgrading
and maintenance activities.

66
    Moreover, LBs and UCs often ignore environmental standards: bulldozers are used, labor-based and
environmentally-friendly approaches are not applied, etc. This non-compliance with environment-related
standards results in roads that rapidly degrade, subject to landslides, etc.

143.     DTOs are not fully anchored within DDC organizational structures. In terms of policy,
DTOs are sector sections of DDCs, but effectively they operate as DoLIDAR outreach offices for
technical support to LBs. DTOs are supervised by DoLIDAR and not the LDO. This arrangement
reportedly can result in internal conflicts between DTOs and DDCs and lead to coordination or
communication problems. Authorization mechanisms for fund flows are not fully institutionalized and
may function on the basis of the personal relationship between LDOs and DTO chiefs. This can also
lead to delays in meeting project implementation schedules and reporting requirements. In some
districts, conflict and limited coordination appear to send negative messages to the general public and
undermine service delivery.68

144.     Monitoring, reporting and evaluation in the local roads sector could be improved.
Progress and financial reporting systems face important challenges at all levels. Monitoring and
reporting functions are given limited priority or importance by stakeholder organizations in the local
roads sector. The personnel responsible for monitoring and reporting may lack skills and/or the
budgetary resources they need to undertake their allocated tasks. There are challenges in regularly
updating and reviewing information about local road networks: VDCs face particular limitations in
this respect, but even DDCs/DTOs do not appear to systematically keep reliable and updated data
about the condition, use and expansion of their road networks. This implies that planning in the sector
is not sufficiently grounded in regular assessments of the local road network.

145.    Despite issues with planning and execution, there is an overall assessment that the
quality of rural roads is improving, particularly in Dhankuta district. This is not to say that roads
are in good shape: over 50% of the public surveyed for this study responded that the quality of local
roads is either very bad or bad. There are significant differences between the two districts: in
Dhanusa, 70% of respondents classify local roads as being of very bad or bad quality while in
Dhankuta less than 35% of respondents assessed the roads to be bad or very bad. More importantly,
just over 50% of people think that the quality of road infrastructure has improved over the last three
years. There is again a strong difference between the two districts: over 73% noting improvement and
23% noting no change in Dhankuta while only 27% saw improvement and 62% noted that quality
remained the same in Dhanusa in the past three years. Given the increase in LBs’ funding envelope
and the prominence of expenditures on roads, at least some improvement is to be expected. At the
same time, the continued poor overall quality suggests that there remains much still to be done.


B. Primary and Lower Secondary (Basic) Education

Introduction

146.     In Nepal, education is the biggest public service delivery sector. The importance of the
sector is underlined by: (a) the size of the population benefiting directly and indirectly from services;
(b) the annual budgetary allocation, which consistently accounts for more than 15% of total public
expenditure (of which about 85% is earmarked for basic and secondary education); and (c) the
workforce involved in service delivery. Nationwide, the school education system consists of almost

                                                       45
 


35,000 schools, nearly 7 million students, more than 200,000 teachers, 1,000 resource persons, and a
few thousand administrative officials of various categories.

147.     School education in Nepal consists of 5 years of primary, 3 years of lower secondary, 2
years of secondary, and 2 years of higher secondary education. Ongoing reforms will restructure
this into basic education (grades 1-8) and secondary education (grades 9-12). This study focuses on
basic education which refers to a combination of what is presently primary and lower secondary
education.

148.     Nepal has made notable progress in enhancing equitable access to all levels of school
education. The net enrollment rate (NER) has reached 95.6% in primary and 55% in secondary
education in 2013/14, compared to 92.6% and 40% in 2009/10. Gender parity in NER has been
achieved at all levels of school education. Likewise, dropout and repetition rates have decreased
significantly in the past five years (although they still continue to be high in grade 1, with a dropout
rate of 7.1 and repetition rate of 17.5, respectively). Cycle completion rates have improved at all
levels. These improvements are indicative of the overall success of government strategies (such as
free textbooks, scholarships for various disadvantaged groups, and mid-day meals in food-deficit
regions) in bringing all children to schools and retaining them.

149.     Progress in improving the quality of education, however, has been modest. Pass rates in
the annual school leaving certificate examinations are below 50%, especially in the public schools
where more than 80% of all students study. Likewise, results from the national assessments of
students from grades 3, 5 and 8 students show on average scores at or less than 50% in the major
subjects, with substantial variations in performance between public and private schools as well as
among public schools. This indicates significant variations in service delivery across districts and
schools.

150.     There is a growing private sector provision of education. As elsewhere in South Asia,
private schooling is an important and growing part of the overall school system, particularly in urban
areas: of the total of about 35,000 schools in the country, 5,500 are private, and approximately 16% of
all school students (grades 1-10) go to private schools. This report, however, focuses largely on the
provision of public education.

151.     Education is more than just the operation of schools. Of course, schools themselves are the
primary mechanism for delivery of education. The inputs of staff, infrastructure, curricula, and
supervision of schools that allow them to perform are critical aspects of service delivery in the sector.
However, provision of education services also includes a broader framework for learning, including
ensuring access to schooling and corresponding attendance of school age children, maintenance of
libraries, non-formal education, adult literacy and early childhood development. These broader issues
fall out of the remit of entities responsible for school management.

Institutional Framework for Basic Education

152.     At the national level, basic and secondary education are the responsibility of the
Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Department of Education (DoE), a central agency that is
responsible for overall implementation of all school education programs. In addition, a number of
semi- and fully autonomous central agencies (such as the Curriculum Development Center) provide
inputs to the education sector.

153.    At the sub-national level, there are Regional Education Directorates (REDs) in each of
the five development regions, and District Education Offices (DEOs) in each of the 75 districts.
DEOs are responsible for a range of functions: financial management (including the disbursement of
funds to schools, school inspections and monitoring). Resource Centers (RCs), each of which serves
and supports several schools, also act as an outreach arm of their respective DEOs.


                                                   46
 


154.     Since 2001, the governance of school education has been highly decentralized, with local
School Management Committees (SMCs) playing a primary role. SMC core members are elected
from among parents, who are entrusted with functions such as school management and development,
teacher recruitment, financial management, and transparency and accountability in the use of funds. In
the absence of LB elections for over a decade, SMC elections have generated significant political
party interest, with winning SMC berths linked to the strength of the party at the local level.69

155.    As provided for in the Seventh Amendment to the Education Act (2001), each tier in the
local body system also has a corresponding Education Committee (EC), which is intended to
ensure horizontal linkages between MoE line departments, LBs and education sector
stakeholders. Accordingly, at the district level, DECs are formed and VECs/MECs at the
VDC/municipality levels. The DEC is headed by the chair of the DDC and the VECs/MECs are
headed by the chairs of the VDCs/municipalities. Other members include GoN officials (including
DEO staff), representatives from lower tier ECs, representatives of School Management Committees
(SMCs), and teachers.

156.    DEC and VECs/MECs have three broad areas of responsibility: planning, resource
mobilization and monitoring & evaluation (see table 6 below for more details). DEC functions are
specified in Education Act (2001), while those of VECs/MECs are prescribed in the Education
Regulations (2011). In practice, DECs are generally operational; VECs/MECs, on the other hand
display limited activity.

                    Grant approval for closure of existing
                      schools

157.    In addition to their role in their respective DEC, VEC or MEC, LBs have (according to
the LSGA) a number of functions with respect to the basic education sector. The 1999 LSGA
includes provisions for the devolution of authority over school education to local bodies (see paras 86
onwards on functional assignments in this report). However, few LBs appear to play an active role in
the management of schools or the basic education sector as a whole, although (as shall be seen below)
some LBs do provide schools with funding or finance certain expenditures (especially the
construction and maintenance of school buildings and facilities). In addition, LBs are to provide
support to other education sub-sectors, such as non-formal education, adult literacy and early
childhood development (ECD).

Planning

158.     In theory, the education sector follows a decentralized, bottom-up planning framework.
The basis for this planning is the formulation of 3-year School Improvement Plans (SIPs) at the
school level and village/municipal education plans (V/MEPs) at the VDC/municipality level. These
are then consolidated at the district level in the form of 3-year District Education Plans (DEPs). All of
these plans are expected to be updated every year. While there are no provisions and practices for
approving the SIPs, the VEP/MEPs and DEPs are expected to be formulated and approved by their
respective Village/Municipal Education Committees (VECs/MECs) and District Education
Committees (DECs).The SIPs are not tied with budget flows from the central treasury. Likewise, there
is no flow of funds from the MoE system to the DECs, MECs and VECs. Furthermore, there is no
official monitoring and reporting of the implementation status of these plans, and several studies70
have suggested that SIPs largely amount to school wish lists, rather than realistic plans per se.

159.     At the same time, the school education sector’s annual planning and budgeting cycle is
driven by a largely top-down process. The annual planning cycle in the MoE (and all other
ministries as well) is aligned with the fiscal calendar (16 July-15 July) and commences with the
receipt of budget ceilings and guidelines from the MoF. Upon receipt of such ceilings and guidelines,
the MoE sends the same to the Department of Education (DoE) and other central level line agencies.
The DoE forwards them to REDs and DEOs, generally by the third week of December (although, in
practice delays happen in sending them). The DEOs prepare their annual strategic implementation
plans (ASIPs) based on the guidelines received from DoE, which are discussed and finalized at the
RED level. These district ASIPs are then submitted to the DoE, which prepares a consolidated
national ASIP together with an annual work plan and budget (AWPB). The ASIP/AWPB is shared
with external development partners in the education sector during the joint annual review mission in
April/May and finalized after discussion. The MoE then incorporates the ASIP/AWPB into its School
Sector Reform Program and submits this to the NPC and the MoF, which finalize it. This final MoE
program and budget is incorporated into the overall national budget by the MoF, which then presents
it to parliament after getting cabinet approval. The expected date of budget approval is usually just
before the beginning of the new fiscal year.

Financing

160.     The central government provides funds to schools through earmarked and non-
earmarked grants. These include grants for salaries, per child funding (PCF) grants, scholarship
grants, grants for school feeding programs in targeted areas, capital grants, and un-earmarked grants
to cover operating costs. These school grants are provided by the MoE and routed through the DoE
and then the DEOs, which then make disbursements to the schools in their district. There is an
additional step involving DDCs signing off on funding allocations for salaries from DoE to DEOs for
onward disbursements to schools in the case of primary teachers’ salaries, but in practice this appears
to be purely pro forma with DDCs lacking authority to do anything other than confirm the allocations
and reroute them to schools through the DEO. In addition, the DEO receives funds for its own
operations from the DoE/MoE.

161.    Central government financing of basic education is significant. As noted above, education
makes up over 15% of total central government expenditures. In Dhankuta and Dhanusa districts,
education sector spending (which was largely for basic and secondary education) in 2011/12 was,
respectively, NPR 514 million and NPR 464 million. For 2011/12, education sector spending in
Dhankuta was greater than all LB revenues combined (NPR 482 million) and about 80% of all LB
revenues (NPR 583 million) in Dhanusa.

162.    Figures available for Dhankuta and Dhanusa show differences in the levels of central
government funding of education in the two districts. In terms of per student71 funding, for
example, Dhankuta consistently received roughly two to three times more from central government
than Dhanusa has over the period 2009-12. This difference in per student funding in the two districts
explains the differences in student-teacher ratios (see figure 12 below).

                                   Figure 12: Student-teacher ratios




163.    Apart from the central treasury, schools/education institutions also can receive funds
from local bodies, I/NGOs, and local individuals. In addition, various school fees (especially for
secondary level students) and other own source resources (e.g. rent from land and buildings belonging
to schools) contribute to school income.

164.    The schools that were surveyed in this study appear to receive very modest financial
contributions from local bodies. In a review of 35 schools in Dhankuta district, all LB contributions
to schools amounted to less than 1.5% of total school income. In 27 schools reviewed in Dhanusa, the
proportion was even lower (less than 0.5% of total school income). See figure 13 below.72

165.     Local body financial contributions to schools are declining in the districts under review.
In Dhankuta, there has been a decline in VDC financial contributions to schools in their jurisdictions –
for the surveyed schools, VDC contributions to school income declined from a little under NPR 0.9
million in 2009/10 (representing 1.5% of total school income) to around NPR 0.75 million in 2011/12
(representing about 1.1% of total school income). VDC officials in Dhankuta confirmed this in
interviews, reporting that education sector spending was a declining VDC priority. The same trend
applies to DDC and municipal contributions to school income in Dhankuta. The same reduction in the
size of VDC contributions to school income has also taken place in Dhanusa – in 2009/10, the VDC
contribution to school income amounted to a little under NPR 0.3 million (or 0.8% of total school
income); in 2011/12 VDCs made no contribution to school income.

                           Figure 13: Dhankuta – sources of school income




166.     When looked at from the point of view of LB budgets, the contribution of LBs to the
basic education sector is somewhat more important – but is still a small proportion of total LB
expenditure. The VDCs surveyed in Dhankuta have been spending about 6.5% of their total
expenditure on the primary and lower secondary education sector. In Dhanusa, however, VDCs spend
less than 0.1% of their total expenditure on education. However, these are probably underestimates of
VDC spending in the education sector because some VDC datasets do not disaggregate spending by
sector for all expenditure items (especially capital).

167.    Recorded (and overall) VDC spending on education has been declining – not only as a
proportion of total VDC expenditure (from 7.2 % in 2009/10 to about 2.8% in 2011/12), but also in
absolute terms (from about NPR 1.4 million in 2009/10 to less than NPR 0.5 million in 2011/12).

168.    This decline in VDC spending on education appears to be part of a longer term trend.
The 2008 UNCDF study of VDCs showed that in 2006/07 education sector spending accounted for
about 13.5% of total VDC expenditure; the 2009 UNDP/INLOGOS study showed that in 2007/08,
education sector spending by VDCs accounted for 18% of block grant expenditure (and presumably a
somewhat smaller % of total expenditure73).

169.     This decline is in response to perceived lack of need for additional funding from LBs.
Income data for the schools in Dhankuta and Dhanusa shows that they are carrying over, every year,
substantial unspent ‘surpluses’, as can be seen from figure 13 above). In Dhankuta, the amounts being
‘brought forward’ account for almost 17% of annual income – and, indeed, are getting larger ever
year (accounting for 10.3% of total income in 2009/10 but 21% of total income in 2011/12). Schools
in Dhanusa carry over less than those in Dhankuta (about 12% of total income as opposed to 17%) –
but this is still substantial74. These carry-overs imply that schools are effectively saving, are
accumulating substantial cash reserves75, and do not have a cash flow problem. Given this, VDCs may
not see any reason to provide local schools with additional funding. Alternatively, and precisely
because their schools have financial reserves, school management committees or head teachers may
not be lobbying their VDCs for additional funding.


73
   In the case of VDCs in the Middle Hills (such as those in Dhankuta), the UNDP/INLOGOS study estimated
that block grants accounted for approximately 70% of total revenues. If this was the case, then 18% of total
block grant expenditure being used for the education sector would have represented about 12.5% of total VDC
expenditure.
74
   This is consistent with the findings of the recent School and Household Survey (New Era 2013), which shows
that carried over funds account for about 17% of total annual school income.
75
   One school in Dhankuta, for example, has actually deposited its ‘savings’ (of some NPR 800,000) into a
‘blocked’ bank account that yields a higher rate of interest than a regular bank account.

                                                     50
 


170.     Another possible explanation for reduced VDC engagement in the basic education sector
in Dhankuta district may be declining levels of enrolment in primary and lower secondary
schools. Overall primary school enrolment in the district has declined steadily over the period 2009-
2013, going from about 31,500 students to just over 24,000 (see figure 14 below). The total student
population in Dhankuta in public primary schools has declined steeply – from almost 30,000 in
2009/10 to under 21,000 in 2012/13. FLASH report data shows that the decline is very steep in VDC
jurisdictions while remaining constant in Dhankuta municipality. The survey shows that in Dhankuta
enrolment rates at the household level are high, with 96.2% of respondents saying they have school
age children that are enrolled. Only 2.9% of the 1,600 respondents state not to send their children to
school. There is no significant difference between VDCs and Dhankuta Municipality, or between boys
and girls enrolment of children in the 5-15 year cohort.

171.     There are several potential causes for declining enrolment in public primary schools in
Dhankuta. One reason is the increased enrolment in private schools, although enrolment in private
schools has risen little (see figure 14 below). Anecdotal reports indicate that private schools are
particularly attractive for providing more English medium instruction; there are also disproportionate
numbers of boys going to these schools. Other reasons for decline include more accurate reporting
and greater uptake of very young children in expanding ECD centers rather than having them attend
school. Finally, there are demographic changes, including an overall decline in population (for
Dhankuta) and the effects of lower fertility rates. Overall in Dhankuta 3% of the surveyed households
do not have school age children, but this includes Veddetar, a VDC where 13% of households do not
have children between 5 and 15. Declining school enrolment rates in Dhankuta, coupled with school
financial surpluses, would be an understandable reason for LBs to de-prioritize funding of the basic
education sector.

172.     In Dhanusa district, primary school enrolment is modestly increasing. Enrolment in all
primary schools has grown, but with both public and private school enrolment being unstable (see
figure 15 below). The survey shows that here enrolment rates are also above 90%, but on aggregate
slightly lower than Dhankuta. In part this is due to Lohanna, Supahi and Basbitti, three VDCs where
between 4 and 6% of school age children do not enroll, but attend Madrasas, Muslim religious schools
(which means they are not counted as attending school). The demographic shift in Dhanusa is slightly
behind Dhankuta: household size is on average one person more per household: 6.4 persons per HH in
Dhanusa, against 5.4 per HH in Dhankuta. However, the reduction in school aged children also
manifests itself in Dhanusa.76

173.    DDCs also spend in the education sector. Between 2009-11, Dhanusa DDC77, for example,
spent almost 8% of its unconditional block grant and land registration revenue78 on the education
sector as a whole, most of it in the primary and lower secondary sub-sectors. After roads & bridges
and community buildings expenditure, education spending is the third largest expenditure item in
Dhanusa DDC.

174.     Of all local bodies, municipalities appear to spend the lowest proportion of their total
expenditure on education. Expenditure data for Dhankuta municipality show that education is a low
spending priority: in both 2010/11 and 2011/12, municipal spending on education represented less
than 2% of total expenditure and – in absolute terms – less than NPR 1.3 million (or $13,000) per
annum. The low priority accorded to public sector schools by municipalities is probably linked to the
relatively greater importance of private schools in urban areas.

175.    Within the education sector, LBs appear to be spending on much the same types of
items. Expenditure data for VDCs in Dhankuta, for example, indicate that VDC financing in the basic
education sector is paying for school operating grants, the purchase of furniture and equipment, the
construction/maintenance of school buildings and facilities, and early childhood development. These
are almost exactly the same types of expenditure incurred by Dhanusa DDC, and in exactly the same
types of schools (primary and lower secondary). The LBs’ financial statements also contain a number
of general purpose grants to schools.

176.    There appears to be a mismatch between what LBs describe as their expenditure in the
basic education sector and what schools record as financial contributions from local bodies.
Schools in Dhankuta, for example, record LB contributions as if they were grants – thus providing
general budgetary support which can be used for a variety of purposes (construction, paying contract
teachers, etc.). LBs, on the other hand, generally record education sector spending in terms of specific
items (such as the purchase of school furniture or school maintenance), rather than as school grants. It
is unclear as to why there is this mismatch.

Financial Management and Reporting

177.    Schools have become de facto cost centers but they are not financially audited through
the state audit mechanism (OAG). Schools are required to carry out financial audits by using
auditors certified by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal and designated by the DEC. Only


77
     Data for Dhankuta DDC is not sufficiently detailed to properly assess education sector spending.
78
     These DDC revenue sources are highly discretionary.

                                                         52
 


60% of schools report that they have undergone regular financial audits.79 Schools continue to receive
central funds irrespective of whether or not they conduct these audits.

178.     The financial audit report is required to be made public through a teacher and parent
meeting and needs to be submitted to the DEO, which will only release third trimester
disbursements to schools if they submit their audit reports on time. Likewise, schools are also
required to conduct an annual social audit through a social audit committee (coordinated by the PTA
chair) that includes an audit of the school’s financial and educational performance. The social audit
report also needs to be submitted to the DEO and has to be made public through a parent assembly.
There are no formal reporting requirements of the school to LBs, though the chair of the respective
ward in which the school is located is a member of the school social audit committee.

179.     Schools are required to report to the MoE line agencies at the district levels on financial
and educational outputs/outcomes. For example, they have to report twice a year on the numbers of
students and teachers, the school’s physical status, etc. through the school FLASH reports that are
collected and verified by the RCs and compiled by the DEOs. School financial reports, however, only
provide a partial picture of their finances: they are limited to expenditures financed out of central
government grants, and do not include income from LBs or other sources of revenue or on the
expenditures financed out of such off-budget income. The DoE is currently in the process of changing
this, so that in the coming FY 2014/15 school financial reports are to include all sources of income
and all expenditure.

Supervision of Schools and Schooling Outcomes

180.     Supervision of public and private schools is undertaken by School Supervisors (SS),
based in DEOs, and by Resource Persons (RP), based in Resource Centers. Resource centers
(RCs) are usually located in the main high school. According to the Education Regulation, the SS is
required to visit schools on a monthly basis, focusing primarily on the regularity of school operations
(including teacher attendance), adequacy of physical facilities and teachers, and teaching-learning
processes. In doing so, the SS is required to work closely with the head teacher and SMC members,
and present supervision reports to the DEO as well as to the concerned VECs/MECs. However, the
geographical area covered by an SS is typically very large (with the school-SS ratio of more than 100
to 1) and the incentives for supervision do not match the enormous task of covering all schools on a
regular basis. In addition, schools are supposed to be more closely supervised by the RPs.80 There are
in total 1,053 RCs nation-wide, usually located in the main local high school, each staffed with one
resource person. Like the SS, the RP is required to visit schools in his/her cluster on a regular basis,
primarily focusing on classroom observations and providing on-the-site professional support to
teachers. However, over the years, the role of the RP has gradually evolved from teacher support to a
more administrative function, acting as a postbox between the DEO and schools. There is also a
duplication of roles and responsibilities between the SS and RP, with the RPs being considered as
subordinate staff of the SS.

181.    Record-keeping for school supervision could be improved. There are no standard formats
used by the SS and RP for school supervision. At the most, they maintain a personal diary. As a result,
there is no systematic recording and availability of data on school performance across a range of
indicators (such as educational, financial and management) at the RC or DEO level.

182.   School performance at the local level is measured in FLASH reports through enrolment
and repetition rates. Repetition rates (see figure 16 below) in Dhankuta declined up until 2010, but
have now flattened out over the past three years; in Dhanusa, repetition rates increased slightly until


79
  See Nepal Education Studies 2012-13: School and Household Survey, New Era 2013.
80
  The legal status of RPs is not clear in the Education Act and Regulations, although they have been an integral
part of the institutional arrangements at the school level since the 1990s.

                                                      53
 


2011, but have since declined. This suggests at least satisfactory performance among primary schools
in both districts. Figures at the VDC and municipal level are not available.

    Figure 16: Repetition rates in all Dhankuta and Dhanusa primary schools (public and private)




183.    Drop-out rates in Dhankuta primary schools have risen, as they have in Dhanusa, but to
a lesser extent. Although it is not clear whether this is part of a persistent trend, it does raise
questions about the external factors that might be at play in making it difficult for children to stay in
the schooling system and what might be done to address them.

    Figure 17: Drop-out rates in all Dhankuta and Dhanusa primary schools (public and private)




184.     Data on school performance in Dhankuta and Dhanusa is contradictory. While the NERs
for both districts have improved over the years, the NER of Dhankuta is higher than the national
average whereas that of Dhanusa is lower. In both districts, the share of private school enrolments has
been gradually increasing. Dhankuta has achieved gender parity in NER at all levels whereas Dhanusa
is yet to achieve this, particularly at the lower secondary and secondary levels, indicating that girls
still face challenges in accessing education, in particular in villages with higher poverty rates or
significant numbers of minorities. It should be noted however, that on average the age at which girls
start to attend school is not higher than for boys (5.75 against 5.83 for boys) and children in rural
VDCs actually start almost a year earlier than those in municipalities. With respect to the efficiency of
education, both districts have higher primary and lower secondary dropout rates than the national
average, with these rates being higher in Dhankuta compared to Dhanusa. In the case of repetition

                                                   54
 


rates, Dhanusa surprisingly reports lower repetition rates than the national average whereas they are
higher in Dhankuta. However, in both the districts, the efficiency of primary and lower secondary
education has gradually improved since 2009.

185.    Survey data on local perceptions show that over 85% of citizens view public primary
and secondary education to be of average or good quality and is moreover improving. This
assessment of quality is higher overall than for private education, though this may be the case because
many fewer respondents have knowledge of or an opinion about the quality of private schooling.81
There is also a general sense among the public that local education services have improved over time:
almost two thirds of respondents perceive that the quality of education has improved over the last
three years, and less than 7% feel that this has worsened. However, there are differences between the
two districts: in Dhankuta, just over 70% of respondents perceive that the quality of education has
improved, while less than 20% feel that quality has remained unchanged; in Dhanusa, the figures are
57% and 32%, respectively. In Dhanusa there are also significant differences among VDCs. Based on
survey results the population in Umaprempur and Lobatoli have consistently the lowest perception of
the quality but even more the infrastructure and facilities in public schools. These are also the two
VDCs with the highest levels of unemployment and poverty.82


Broader Concerns in Frontline Delivery of Local Basic Education

186.    LBs are not active in the school education sector, but this has little impact on schools per
se. Basic education at the local level is not short of government funding, SMCs and DEOs (for the
most part) manage inputs, and the private sector provides an ever more significant alternative to
public sector schools. Given all this, LBs are not major players in financing or supporting basic
education schooling.

187.    LBs in general and the local education management institutions that they lead
(VECs/MECs) are also not active in addressing broader educational issues in their jurisdictions.
Neither schools nor local authorities are active in trying, for example, to increase enrolment. In Nepal
as a whole, an estimated 9.4% of children aged 5-12 are out of school83 in 2011. Currently, there do
not appear to be initiatives at the local level to bring those children into the schooling system, even
though this might be a way for local institutions to engage with education. In a similar way, external
factors that exacerbate repetition or drop-out rates are not addressed by local authorities (such as
scarce or distant water supplies, which may force families to keep their children at home in order to
take on domestic chores). Addressing these broader educational challenges could be a part of
VEPs/MEPs.

188.     This includes addressing the overall deployment of resources to meet the changing local
needs for formal education. There is a major decline in primary (public) school enrolment in
Dhankuta. In some cases there are less than fifteen children in schools for grades 1-3. This raises
important issues on rationalizing the use of public resources for education. VDCs and the DDC might
be expected to lead and coordinate a process of school consolidation and teacher redeployment
through their positions in VECs and the DEC. Reconfiguring the primary school network within
localities is highly political, and is something that goes beyond the competence of SMCs which are
concerned only with their individual school. At the same time, it is beyond the capacity of a small
DEO which has limited human resources in supervising the existing schools, let alone taking on a
more comprehensive challenge of rationalization. There is no indication that VECs and the DEC meet
regularly, or look at systemic education issues in their jurisdictions.



81
   30% of the VDCs did not have any private schools.

189.     Finally, there is no evidence that local bodies plan their priority service delivery
functions (especially local roads and water supply & sanitation) in ways that complement school
education. The planning of local roads activities, for example, is not based on improving access to
other basic services, including school education. This may not be a significant issue. Survey data
indicate that roads and transport is not a major obstacle to access to education facilities. In Dhankuta
99% of the students walk to school, in Dhanusa 87% and a significant number frequently uses a
bicycle. In both districts it takes on average 20 minutes to reach the school.

190.    There is an apparent conundrum between the progress observed nationally and in
reviewed districts in the education sector and the convoluted structure of inputs to service
delivery in schools. The mix of financing of inputs and lack of local and national level coordination
mechanisms may be affecting frontline service delivery, but evidence indicates that the impact is
operationally not significant. The system is improving according to basic operational indicators such
as net enrolment rates. Survey data suggests that citizens on balance see improvement in their
schools’ operations. The available evidence suggests that the decentralization carried out through the
SMCs, overseen by DEOs, with negligible and decreasing involvement of LBs is effective. At the
same time, there remains cause for concern about quality of education, particularly as parents are
proving increasingly ready to spend on private schools for their children.

                            IV.      Conclusions and Recommendations
                                  to Improve Frontline Service Delivery

A. Conclusions

On Local Bodies’ Role in Nepal’s Public Service Delivery Framework

191.    Nepal has increased LB revenues six-fold over the past six years without corresponding
changes in the institutional framework for local government. The jump in funding has not been
matched by an overhaul of LBs’ responsibilities, relationship to other entities involved in public
service delivery, or administrative arrangements and skills. Capacity building programs have focused
mostly on local participation rather than technical expertise or improved management.

192.     LB responsibilities reflect an approach of ‘supplementarity’ rather than the principle of
subsidiarity. The legal framework sets out an expansive list of functions which LBs may choose to
undertake, but government rules make central government agencies actually responsible. The only
major function where LBs are mostly responsible is vital events registration. Outside of this service,
LBs either carry out functions as a result of conditional grants – such as delivery of social benefits and
local roads – or pick and choose from a large menu of possible small projects without consideration of
their relationship to issues in the given sector. This has led to proliferation of micro projects ranging
from income generation to buying land for the local police station. Despite survey results indicating
that health and education are a priority, LBs undertake work that is de facto in areas where there are
no deconcentrated service providers or separate decentralized entities such as School Management
Committees.

193.     Disparities in geography and demography are not reflected in LBs’ institutional
framework or operations. All VDCs, municipalities, and DDCs operate under the exact same legal
framework for their respective units despite great disparity in size, population density, the nature of
service needs, and revenue potential (though this is less important given the limitations on OSRs). For
instance, the five largest municipalities have the same population as the next 23 municipalities, yet
they operate under the same rules. Localities with more potential capacity and revenues are not given
greater responsibilities. Moreover, DDCs and primary level VDCs and municipalities perform similar
functions: financial reports for Dhankuta and Dhanusa LBs showed little variation in expenditures’
sectoral profiles.

194.    LBs appear to have become a successful conduit for local empowerment. The roughly
50% of LB revenues that are largely discretionary appear to provide for significant responsiveness to
the local population. It is difficult to assess the extent to which these resources benefit the
disadvantaged or are captured by local interest groups such as political parties or local elites. At a
minimum the bottom-up planning process takes place in many locations and it appears that the Ward
Citizen Forums influence allocation decisions. The requirement to use proportions of the block grants
to benefit underprivileged segments of the population may also contribute to forestalling elite capture.

195.    While the planning process promotes participation, it is complex and its orientation
towards addressing public service delivery could be strengthened. Local planning is characterized
by a lack of timely information about budget ceilings; lack of coordination with planning by line
agencies compounded by different schedules for these often parallel processes; and a large number of
steps. More importantly, LB planning – except in the use of conditional grants, e.g. for most local
roads – does not appear to be based on a structured assessment of needs or a holistic view of what is
needed to improve service provision within sectors. While there is a five-year periodic plan, the
annual plans do not reference prior year activities (except in cases where continued funding is
proposed) or future year activities. There is limited technical input into planning overall or in the
assessment of individual projects, particularly among VDCs.



                                                   57
 


196.    The intergovernmental finance framework does not focus on addressing imbalances. The
assignment of revenues and design of transfers do not take into consideration LBs’ expenditure
assignments and needs. There is no implicit or explicit assessment of the vertical imbalances that LBs
might face. The grants also do not systematically address horizontal imbalances. Although there is
some weighting of the block grants by population and density, there remain important disparities in
per capita revenues among LBs. This was shown in the 10-fold per capita differences in block and
conditional grant transfers for Dhankuta DDC and Dhanusa DDC.

197.     The intergovernmental finance framework does not stimulate local revenue effort. The
system for local taxes is limited by low capacity, insignificant types of taxes outside of real property
taxes, and insufficient powers over setting rates and the base. Steadily increasing intergovernmental
transfers appear to crowd out incentives to gather local taxes, though the inherent limitations of local
taxes also likely play a role in the lack of tax effort. There currently does not appear to be a ‘virtuous
circle’ of citizens paying taxes and local leaders delivering services which benefit citizens and
increase the value of their assets. Instead, temporarily posted civil servants divide up funds provided
by the center.

198.    There is significant scope for strengthening the management systems at the local level.
Nepal’s LBs face objective difficulties due to limited professional staff, high turnover, and scarcity of
suitably skilled accountants, engineers, and other specialists to work in often remote localities. These
challenges are compounded by rules which are complex and practices which are not conducive to
good management. LBs are reliant on transfers, but these appear to be frequently delayed either from
the center or, for VDCs, at the district level. There are many separate transfers for a variety of
purposes. The delays and complexity of transfers can hinder efficient planning and execution.

199.     LB-citizen relations are not qualitatively different from other public institutions in spite
of their greater proximity. Respectively a quarter and a fifth of citizens found primary level LBs and
DDCs to be very or completely trustworthy according to survey results; in all cases a plurality found
LBs to be moderately trustworthy. Perceptions of other public institutions such as the DEO or the
police were similar, indicating no particularly higher or lower levels of trust. A third of respondents
noted that it could influence their VDC/municipality regarding education and only 20% felt the same
concerning roads construction, despite the fact that roads are seen as more clearly a LB function.

On Service Delivery in the Local Roads Sector

200.     The local roads sector is a key sector for LBs. While LBs, particularly VDCs, are
intensively involved in social protection, the local roads sector is significant for all three types of LBs.
It was by far the largest sector where expenditures could be identified in the target districts. It is a
service for which LBs are in large part responsible for the identification, allocation, and conduct of
activities to improve the local road network. This is driven in part by conditional grants to DDCs, but
evidence from the LBs reviewed in this study suggests that they additionally spend between 15% to
40% of their total discretionary funds on local roads. The large number of small roads projects
suggests that the sector allows for meeting a large number of localized demands while also being
effective in meeting block grant beneficiary targeting requirements since a road is a public good
serving a range of persons.

201.    The institutional framework for local roads is a mix of local management and central
direction. While there is no other entity on the ground involved in maintaining the local roads
network (except in some instances the Department of Roads), LBs nonetheless in important respects
fall under DoLIDAR’s supervision. As DoLIDAR falls under MoFALD coordination at the central
level is presumably easier than, for instance, with the Education Ministry. At the same time,
DoLIDAR plays a substantial oversight role over DDCs through the provision and monitoring of
several types of conditional grants. Moreover, the DTO is subordinate to DoLIDAR rather than the
DDC, meaning that technical inputs and approvals are not fully under the DDC’s authority.


                                                    58
 


202.     Planning for district level roads is mostly integrated but not comprehensive. The DTMPs
provide overall information about the local roads networks; DoLIDAR requires identification of a
core district network upon which the DDCs are to focus in utilizing some of conditional grants
provided to it (in part as a function of credit agreements with donors financing the roads sector).
However, as was seen in Dhankuta where each of the 22 core roads received a small allocation for
maintenance regardless of need, this does not necessarily obviate the ‘dividing up’ approach to
allocating resources as the local level. In addition, other conditional grants are provided at different
times with yet other conditions that can impair cohesive planning. Finally, at least in Dhankuta DDC
the use of resources outside of conditional grants by DDCs was decided via the LB planning process
without reference to the DTMP.

203.    There is no systematic planning for village level local roads. Outside of DTMPs – which
only apply to the DRCN – there is no technically-informed planning for development of the local
roads network. VDC planning for roads occurs within the general framework for local bodies’
planning.

204.     Earmarked financing of the local roads sector is not conducive to stronger planning.
Some roads sector grants are provided on an ad hoc and unpredictable basis. In addition, a range of
strictly earmarked and semi-parallel funds (such as Constituency Development Funds, budget re-
allocations made by central ministries, ‘matching’ funds for municipalities) are allocated to local
bodies, further limiting any coherent approach to the management of local roads.

205.     LBs generally lack basic engineering capacity. There is a limited number of technical staff
spread thinly across a large number of projects and activities. For example, a half-dozen DTO
technical staff in Dhanusa are responsible for at least 60 district roads projects every year (in addition
to scores of other infrastructure projects, such as water supply facilities). Increasingly large
conditional and unconditional grants have expanded spending on the local roads sector which has
further stretched local technical capacities. There is a mismatch between spending on local roads and
the technical capacity of local bodies to properly manage activities in the local roads sector.

206.    Monitoring, reporting and evaluation in the local roads sector are limited. Progress and
financial reporting systems for roads projects are spotty for smaller projects, particularly when not
related to donor-funded projects which usually have more rigorous reporting requirements.
Monitoring and reporting functions are given limited priority or importance by stakeholder
organizations in the local roads sector.

207.    Citizens nonetheless assess that there has been improvement in the local roads network
over the past three years, albeit much remains to be done. Over half of the respondents saw
improvement while over 40% felt that the quality remained the same. At the same time, a solid
majority still felt that roads were bad or very bad.

On Service Delivery in the Basic Education Sector

208.     Basic education service delivery is decentralized to School Management Committees.
Reforms beginning in 2001 have directed funding for various service inputs such as staff,
infrastructure, stipends to the SMCs. Most funds are earmarked for salaries for permanent and
temporary teachers. The SMCs exercise substantial discretion over hiring of contract staff, including
teachers.

209.    There is limited effective local oversight of schools’ use of funds. Many of the same
challenges with financial reporting and controls in LBs occur with respect to schools. Financial
reports are driven by revenue source; although changes are now planned to introduce more
comprehensive reporting until now schools have submitted reports only on use of centrally provided
funds to the DEO, leaving out own source resources and LB contributions. Schools have become de
facto cost centers but their financial reporting is subject to only cursory review by the local DEO; nor

                                                   59
 


are schools audited by the Auditor General’s Office. Schools are required to carry out annual financial
audits by using certified private accountants, but only 60% of schools report that such regular audits
take place. Similar to the situation with LBs, audit findings are not systematically acted upon; schools
continue to receive central funds irrespective of whether or not they conduct these audits.

210.     A marked decline in students at public (community) schools raises the need for
rationalization. The decline appears due to demographic factors such as out-migration and lower
birth rates as well as family choices to send their children, especially boys, to private boarding
schools. Field workers for this study found schools with actual attendance of some 15 children in
grades 1-3. The decline could prompt a rationalization of the number of schools in operation and
staffing.

211.    LBs’ role in basic education is limited and declining in terms of financing. Studies from
five years ago suggested local bodies taking a keener interest and spending as much as 13% of their
total expenditure on schools. However, the recent Education sector QSDS/PETS as well as the data
collected from schools in the target districts for this study point to LBs playing a tiny role (3% and 1%
of school income, respectively); as a proportion of LB spending education is also declining. The
decline appears due to the combination of robust central funding for schools and a decline in the
numbers of children in community schools.

212.     The limited role of LBs is not affecting the efficiency of delivery of basic education in
schools. The relative progress in terms of net enrolment rates nationally and in the target districts
gives little compelling reason for increasing the role of LBs in school management.

213.    LBs are not playing an active role in ensuring education for all children in their
jurisdictions. The administrative heads of LBs have a de jure role chairing corresponding village,
municipal, and district education committees. These committees are supposed to provide broad
oversight of schools operations and facilitate planning. The committees are also positioned to identify
education needs beyond what is visible in the schools, i.e. identifying and addressing issues with
children not attending school and/or attending private schools. However, these committees display
limited activity. LBs treat education as a central government function.

214.    Overall service outcomes appear to be positive in terms of efficiency and citizen
satisfaction. A total of 63% and 72% of survey respondents felt that respectively primary and
secondary education had improved in the past three years. Overall dropout rates and net enrolment
rates have improved over the past three years as well.

B. Recommendations for Improving Frontline Service Delivery

215.    The findings of this study point to two sets of potential measures to improve frontline
service delivery: long term changes in the institutional framework and actionable steps within
the existing framework. Improvements could be made both in local bodies’ general performance and
capacity to contribute to service delivery, as well as actions that directly concern the local roads and
basic education sectors.

216.     Work on the institutional framework is a complex task since current arrangements for
frontline service delivery involve numerous stakeholders with multiple interests. Changes to
these arrangements go to the heart of how the state operates and interacts with citizens. Therefore, the
details of implementing changes to frontline service delivery would benefit from substantial
consultation with stakeholders.

217.    Issues concerning the role of local bodies are also part of the broader, contentious
deliberations around federalizing Nepal’s governance structure. While these deliberations have
focused on defining federal units, the role of local bodies and the lower links in the service delivery
chain are critical elements. Local governments are near certain to have a place in any new federal

                                                   60
 


system, albeit not necessarily the existing territorial units. For this reason factors which promote
better local government practices under the current system merit consideration irrespective of the
deliberations on federalism (see Box 8).

                  Box 8: Frontline Service Delivery and the Deliberations on Federalism
Nepal’s major political parties have committed to establishing a federal system of government though
consensus has not been reached on the details of such a system. The preceding Constituent Assembly (CA)
eventually dissolved without drafting a new Constitution in large part due to unresolved issues about
federalism. The present Assembly elected in November 2013 has renewed work on drafting a Constitution and
has decided to base its efforts on previously developed analysis and proposals.
The prior CA’s Committee on Restructuring of the State and Distribution of State Power produced a 186-page
report summarizing extensive research on domestic preferences, international practices, and theory on the
potential design of a federal system in 2010. The report provides a comprehensive framework for designing an
effective decentralized system, laying out the decisions which the country’s political leadership must make. In
particular, it provides detailed exposition of the ‘building blocks’ for a strong system of sub-national
governance and service delivery:
    i. Principles for identification of sub-national units;
   ii. Assignment of functional responsibilities for public services to national, federal, and local governments;
  iii. Principles to underpin an intergovernmental fiscal system through assignment of own source revenues
         and intergovernmental transfers; and
  iv. Provision of administrative authority to levels of government to carry out service functions, including
         control over relevant staff and intangible and physical assets associated with the service.

The present organization of frontline service delivery is important when considering a transition to a federal
state for two main reasons. First, Nepal could draw on its own experience with sub-national governance and
service delivery when designing the future system. Issues in the current system, particularly ambiguities in
functional assignments and the long practice of LBs mostly playing a supplemental role in service provision,
could be addressed in a new design. Addressing shortcomings could begin prior to a more far reaching
transition to a federal system that might be undertaken. Second, setting up a new system of sub-national
governance will necessarily involve a complex transition from the existing system to the new design. A
detailed mapping of how services are delivered at present and when and how they are transferred to new
entities could help minimize disruption of service delivery in the transition.


218.    Changes should consider building on ongoing efforts to strengthen the institutional
framework for local service delivery. Since 2006, for example, MoFALD has extended performance
(‘MC/PM’) assessments to all local bodies and calibrated block grant allocations to assessed
performance. The country-wide Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP),
implemented by MoFALD with funding from a range of development partners, has also provided a
framework for incremental local governance reforms (such as establishing WCFs, revising LB
guidelines, and reviewing grant allocation formula). Recommendations could build on the
considerable work heretofore undertaken. At the same time, this study finds that there remains more
that might be done to strengthen local bodies’ performance.

Long Term Institutional Considerations

219.     Local Bodies could be oriented to fulfill the role of a local government that is more
clearly responsible for public service outcomes. While present practices have had success in social
mobilization and transferred resources to localities, they have not encouraged local bodies to ensure
delivery of public services, a role commonly played by local governments in many countries. Such a
shift in orientation will be complex because expectations among officials and the population have
been conditioned by LBs’ practice of ‘picking and choosing’ small projects for the past 15 years. The
institutional framework would need to be changed to build in stronger lines of accountability for
service delivery, addressing the classic ‘building blocks’ of decentralized government: functions,
finance, and functionaries.


                                                       61
 


220.    Accountability for functions might be assigned more clearly, spelling out LBs’ authority
in sufficient detail. This does not mean an increase in functions for LBs. It is rather an increase in
accountability for specific functions which could efficiently be carried out at the local level. These
reforms could ideally include:
     Introducing the concept of ‘own exclusive’ assignments for LBs, for which they are fully
        responsible and have corresponding authority;
     Allowing for asymmetric assignment, recognizing the different geographic and demographic
        circumstances for local government units (which would remain true even if there is a change
        among units as a result of federalism and a new constitution);
     With respect to functions that are shared with central government, delineating tasks within
        functional areas and then assigning them unambiguously among the different tiers of LBs and
        line agencies;
     Retaining substantial local discretion to take on functions voluntarily in response to local
        needs and priorities;
     Ensuring harmonization with other (sectoral) legislation, particularly the Government Rules
        of Business.

221.    Transfer of responsibilities can be done sequentially for different public services or
occur in all areas at the same time. Some countries, most notably Indonesia, have adopted ‘big
bang’ approaches to decentralization where responsibilities in all functional (service) areas were
reassigned in one round. Other countries have adopted a more incremental approach whereby
responsibility for a small number of public services is transferred at first. These services are usually in
areas where the role of local governments would be expected to be significant and/or a division of
responsibilities is relatively straightforward (e.g. ensuring potable water or local roads). It is expected
that local governments would increase capacity and hence be better able to absorb more complex
responsibilities in successive rounds.

222.     Changes to the intergovernmental financial system should provide more predictability
and stimulate local revenue collection effort. To the extent possible, reforms in revenue
assignments could focus on boosting own source revenues, as well as harmonizing, simplifying and
clarifying them. Intergovernmental fiscal transfers could be consolidated, made more predictable and
equitable, and designed so as to incentivize own source revenue collection at the sub-national level.

223.    Development of personnel management systems that support LBs’ administrative
authority could be considered. Providing a framework to motivate skilled persons to work in local
bodies while also being accountable to LBs is a challenge. Although the present system of
secondment of senior officers subordinate to MoFALD raises few issues in the absence of locally
elected bodies, administrative officials could be answerable to the LBs when they are elected.
Discussion underway regarding the development of a sub-national government cadre, presently in the
context of a potential move to a federal system, reflects the importance of making staff locally
accountable. A key element of such as a transition could ensure ease of movement between local and
national civil service cadres.

224.     LBs’ accountability could be increased through holding elections. Though elections are
far from the only means of building downward accountability, they would play an important role in an
overall framework that could incentivize performance in serving citizens in localities.

225.     The transfer of functional responsibility, financial resources to address these
responsibilities, and authority over personnel should be concomitant and aligned to the extent
possible. The expansion of local government responsibilities should coincide with an assessment of
levels of finance to execute those responsibilities and corresponding changes to the intergovernmental
fiscal framework to provide for those levels. Local bodies should also administratively be empowered



                                                    62
 


to have sufficient staff needed for ensuring the execution of what is required to deliver services for
which they are responsible.

Potential Actionable Steps in the Short and Medium Term

226.     Addressing the areas identified for areas for improvement of frontline service delivery
must take into consideration Nepal’s specific circumstances. In particular, there are substantial
challenges due to dispersion and remoteness of many jurisdictions and a related lack of technical and
administrative capacity. For instance, the problems with local reporting are much less a question of
guidelines than of local capacity. The lack of technical inputs for planning and execution in the roads
sector is in part due to the scarcity of qualified persons in many of the country’s localities. Actionable
recommendations must be simple and geared to these capacity constraints.

Short Term Steps

For the Government of Nepal, initiated by MoFALD:

227.    Address LB human resource constraints. LBs, especially VDCs, would benefit from
additional capacity in accounting and in basic engineering (at the level of an overseer). More regular
book-keeping could improve accountability and ultimately allow for better coordination with line
agencies. More technical input into LBs’ planning and execution of infrastructure projects could be
beneficial. Two options may be considered:
     Provide for accountant and overseer positions among VDC staff, and augment positions in
        DDCs and municipalities.
     Facilitate the hiring of accountants and overseers which could be shared by several VDCs and
        perhaps municipalities and DDCs. Five VDCs in Dhankuta reportedly share an overseer – this
        approach could be replicated. MoFALD could provide guidance to facilitate the establishment
        of joint committees of LBs to share staff.

Such a change could involve establishing links with professional associations (such as the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Nepal) that have members who could provide these technical and
managerial inputs. The linkage could include orienting professionals to the particular needs of LBs.
The horizontal linkages would over time help to improve capacity. Finally, additional personnel may
require additional financing, though this could be justified given that LBs are receiving six times more
funds than before. Financing might be through grants; any increase in funding for personnel could be
matched with more rigorous monitoring of standards for financial management and technical inputs.

228.    Carry out a review of DoLIDAR and DTO staffing needs. While many technical functions
can be out-sourced to the private sector, core design and supervisory functions probably require
additional full-time staff. At the same time, more thought needs to be given to the ways in which
VDCs can be provided with basic technical support from DTO offices.

229.    Adjust planning processes. Although much of the planning process is mandated by law and
hence not easily changed, there may be adjustments that could lead to more strategic and service-
focused plans which incorporate principles of good public investment management. These are:
       Introducing simple needs assessments into the planning process. This could involve having
        mandatory planning formats that LBs would use to estimate the baseline levels of service,
        constraints and problems in key local service sectors, e.g. roads, water & sanitation,
        education, and health. These assessments might encourage more strategic investments as well
        as consideration of how LB activities can contribute towards improving the quality and/or
        quantity of those services.
       Harmonizing the LB and sector planning calendar. This could allow for more synergy at the
        local level.


                                                   63
 


       Orienting local planning processes towards a medium-term or ‘pipeline’ perspective. This
        might address issues of short-term orientation and the danger of ‘participation fatigue’ of the
        annual planning process.

230.     Strengthen LBs financial management framework. The increase in resources makes
improving the framework whereby local bodies manage their funds a priority. There are several
actions that might be considered:
       Unifying, harmonizing and simplifying reporting formats and making their use mandatory.
        Reports could consolidate various revenues and expenditures, regardless of source into one
        document that is the same for all LBs of the same type.
       Strengthening MoFALD capacity to ensure reporting and interpret LBs’ spending patterns.
        MoFALD could become able to collate and use LB reports for purposes of monitoring and
        broader strategic planning.
       Incrementally introducing functional expenditure reporting. This could start with reporting on
        capital or developmental expenditures, for which LBs would be expected to provide a simple
        but clear breakdown in terms of sectors.
       Consolidating bank accounts held by local bodies. This could reduce fiduciary risk as well as
        encourage LBs to report on expenditures and revenues in a more comprehensive way.
       Removing a local bottleneck in the disbursement of transfers. While delays in
        intergovernmental transfers are a longstanding issue with causes beyond the scope of this
        report, at the local level LDOs’ authority to release funds to VDCs creates additional delays.
        Rather than having LDOs wait to group requests from VDCs before approving disbursements,
        VDCs could submit their financial reports directly to the DTCO with a copy to their DDC.
        The DDC could have a set time period (for instance two weeks) to raise any concerns; in the
        absence of written concerns, the DTCO could be authorized to release funds directly to the
        VDC’s account.

For DoLIDAR/MoFALD

231.    More fully integrate the District Technical Offices into the DDC structure, rather than
preserving the at times competitive structure in place. While there are valid reasons to insulate
DTOs from local influence (including political), if LBs are to be made accountable for service areas
they will need to have an integrated management structure to deliver.

For the Ministry of Education and the Education Sector

232.   Carry through with plans to consolidate school reporting of all revenue and
expenditures, including from LBs, NGOs and OSR in FY 2014/15. This could help SMCs make
more strategic use of available resources. It would also allow for better overall planning and
deployment of resources for basic education at the national level.

233.    Clarify the roles and responsibilities of Education Committees at local levels to address
issues of providing education beyond the operation of schools. The VECs/MECs/DECs could be
promoted as fora within which education sector activities are coordinated at the local level without
getting into issues of individual school management that are handled by SMCs and supervised by
DEOs. Local level Education Committees could play a role in addressing questions of attendance,
enrolment, and, given demographic trends, rationalization. This would require amending the
Education Regulations and cooperation between the Education Ministry and MoFALD to provide
local Education Committees with active guidance and support. Such work could be undertaken
irrespective of whether a more profound delineation of functions is undertaken in the sector.

Medium Term Recommendations

For the Government of Nepal, initiated by MoFALD:

234.    Delineate service responsibilities to the extent possible within existing legislation.
Delineation should occur between DDCs and primary tier VDCs and municipalities, as well as in
relation to central government agencies. Expenditure patterns show that DDCs, VDCs and
municipalities finance the same types of expenditures with the only difference being that DDCs take
on more costly capital projects. The District Transport Management Plans largely achieve a
delineation of responsibilities in the local roads sector through distinguishing between the District
Core Roads network for which DDCs are responsible with the presumption that VDCs and
municipalities are responsible for other local roads. The same kind of demarcation of functional
responsibilities between DDCs, VDCs and municipalities could be made in other sectors where LBs
presently play a large role, such as water & sanitation or irrigation. For services which presently are
essentially central in nature, such as education, guidance on what LBs are responsible for could be
developed in conjunction with sector agencies.

235.     A delineation of service responsibilities might first be modeled and tested for a few
functions. It is a complex task to transfer service responsibilities. There are many types of inputs and
activities that are carried out to deliver services. Moreover, the inputs and activities for each public
service will differ. In the short term, the GoN might consider modeling a detailed description of what
LBs (with differentiation among VDCs, municipalities, and DDCs) and what line agencies would be
responsible for in two or three functions. One would be a case where there is clearly a large role
played by LBs (e.g. local roads, water supply) and the other might be a case where central agencies
will play a major role (e.g. social services such as basic education or primary healthcare). The
delineation would distinguish between operational authority to make decisions on quantity and quality
of services delivered; long term planning, including capital investment; service standards; oversight
and monitoring functions; and incentives for performance. Undertaking such a delineation of
responsibilities would need to be reflected in changes to existing regulations to avoid overlap and
inconsistencies. It would also likely require a program to prepare LBs for greater responsibilities.

236.     Simplify the system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Conditional grants that target
the same sector, such as local roads or water & sanitation, could be provided at the same time and
have harmonized reporting requirements. This would require intensive consultations with donors
which are the ultimate source of many of the grants and have their own conditions, often including
traceability of fund flows. Consolidation would help central management of fund flows and, more
importantly, would provide an enabling framework for a more strategic approach to service delivery
in these functional areas.

237.    Improve the predictability of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. There are three major
ways where improvement may be sought. First, avoid ad hoc and mid/end year allocations as is now
often the case with conditional grants. Second, provide local bodies with next year transfer ceilings
before the beginning of the annual local planning/budgeting cycle. This might be considered in the
context of the budget calendar mandated in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Third, stronger formula-
driven allocations which recognize objective disparities among LB jurisdictions, particularly for
conditional grants, could be considered.

                           ANNEX 1: METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY

This report is largely based on two field-level surveys. The first survey, carried out by INLOGOS,
collected quantitative and qualitative data concerning local level public expenditure and financial
management. The second survey, carried out by Solutions Consultant Pvt. Ltd., collected information on
public perceptions about local level service delivery. Both surveys were carried out in the same sample of
local body jurisdictions in two districts.
This annex provides a short description of the methodology used in the first survey to collect data and
information for this study, as well as an assessment of the data collected. The methodology used for the
second survey (on public perceptions regarding local service delivery) is described in annex 5.

1. Case study approach

Given time limitations, data collection was not intended to provide a representative database for local
service delivery in Nepal. Instead, a ‘case study’ approach was taken, whereby data was collected from a
relatively small sample of local governments and frontline service delivery units in order to provide
illustrative material and evidence-based grounds for exploring issues related to local service delivery.

2. Selection of districts, local bodies and sectors

The study focused its data collection on two districts – Dhanusa and Dhankuta. These districts were
selected on the basis of a number of criteria. Firstly, they are located in different ecological zones:
Dhanusa in the floodplains of the Terai and Dhankuta in the Middle Hills. Secondly, they are very
different in terms of local governance: the performance of local bodies (LBs) in Dhanusa is poor, largely
because of political conflict, while that of Dhankuta’s LBs is assessed as being good. Thirdly, Dhanusa
and Dhankuta have different poverty profiles, the former being considerably poorer than the latter.
Two sectors were selected for detailed data and information collection. Basic education was selected
because: (a) earlier studies had indicated that LBs were providing significant funding for schools; (b)
although a ‘devolved’ sector, funding and policy remain very much the responsibility of the Ministry of
Education; and (c) the primary and lower secondary education sectors are some of the most important
public services. The local roads sector was selected because: (a) it is very much a core local government
mandate; (b) local roads spending by LBs is significant; and (c) the sector makes a major contribution to
socio-economic development.
A sample of LBs were selected in each of the two districts: five VDCs in each district, the DDC and the
municipalities. VDCs were selected so as to be more or less representative of socio-economic diversity.
Within VDCs, all basic public schools were included in the study; in each municipality, a sample of
schools was selected. District Education Offices (DEOs), District Treasury & Comptroller Offices
(DTCOs), and Divisional Offices of the Department of Roads (DoR) were also included in the study.

3. Collection of data and information

Primary local level data

The field-level survey was undertaken by INLOGOS and was carried out by two teams of four
enumerators, with each team being supervised by a district coordinator under the overall guidance of a
national team leader. The INLOGOS teams collected data in their respective districts in two rounds: a first
round lasting about 3 weeks, followed a month later by a second round of less than a week.
The survey teams used standard forms for each type of institution for collecting data: forms for
quantitative data (revenues, expenditure, staffing, students, etc.) and checklists of questions for qualitative
data.
The teams collected revenue and expenditure data for three FYs (2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12) from:
VDCs, schools, DDCs, municipalities, DEOs, divisional DoR offices and DTCOs. To the extent possible,
hard copies of financial statements, planning documents, audit reports, council minutes and other
documents were collected and information transcribed from these into the standard forms. The same
applied to staffing and, in the case of schools, to student numbers.
Additional and more qualitative information (about planning, management, etc.) was collected through
interviews with LB staff, school teachers, and others. In addition, the enumerators pieced together small
case studies and recorded them as notes.
After the first round of fieldwork, the INLOGOS team returned to Kathmandu in order to verify and
collate data. Data gaps and inconsistencies were identified. A second round of fieldwork in the two
districts took place in order to iron out inconsistencies and to complete – as far as possible – datasets.

Secondary data and other sources of information

In addition to the INLOGOS teams in the field, several consultants or World Bank staff collected data and
information at the center, with a focus on the local roads sector, primary and secondary education, and the
intergovernmental fiscal framework, This involved collecting information from a number of institutions:
DoLIDAR, DoE, MoFALD, and the Local Bodies’ Fiscal Commission. Relevant documentation and
reports were also consulted.

Difficulties and limitations

Data collection in the districts proved to be as difficult as expected, if not more so. LBs’ financial records
often proved to be fragmented, incomplete, inconsistent and – on occasion – non-existent. High staff
turnover among VDC Secretaries and other LB staff exacerbate these problems. In Dhanusa, for example,
Umaprempur VDC has had four different VDC Secretaries in the last three years, while Labtoli VDC has
had three different VDC Secretaries in the last twelve months. Such high rates of turnover inevitably result
in weak institutional memory.
Data collection in Dhanusa district was particularly challenging. Several DDC staff have been suspended
pending investigations into malpractice and corruption. In addition, the DEO was under investigation by
the CIAA, which had been alerted to the existence of ‘phantom’ schools in the district – allegedly
registered officially and receiving government grants, but non-existent in reality. Finally, the district
suffers from chronic political conflict and poor local governance. Dhanusa has consistently been rated by
MoFALD as one of the worst performing districts in the country. All of this made it difficult for the
enumerators to meet with local officials in Dhanusa in order to get information. Financial and other
records in Dhanusa proved to be very difficult to obtain and, moreover, were usually incomplete. For
example, in four of the five VDCs surveyed in Dhanusa, financial reports were not available in VDC


                                                      7
offices and could only be found in the homes or briefcases of VDC Secretaries. Even when such records
could be located, they were – more often than not – incomplete.
Although data collection was easier in Dhankuta, where most financial and other records were filed in
local body and other offices, the INLOGOS team still faced difficulties in collecting financial data from
LBs due to inadequate/inconsistent record keeping and missing documents. It was particularly difficult to
collect financial data that would allow the study to analyse LB sector-wise expenditure. However, many
fewer difficulties were encountered in collecting financial data from local schools.
Given the difficulties encountered in the collection of primary data, the existing datasets for Dhankuta and
especially Dhanusa are incomplete (and sometimes inconsistent). Excepting a few cases in Dhanusa,
school datasets are generally the most robust and consistent. VDC datasets from Dhankuta are relatively
good; for Dhanusa, however, the VDC datasets include several major gaps. The two municipal datasets
are reasonably solid, although the dataset for Janakpur is incomplete. Surprisingly, DDC-level financial
data from Dhanusa is much more complete than for Dhankuta.

LBs are required to formulate periodic and annual plans. The LSGA and the Resource Mobilization and
Operation Management Guidelines (2013) provide for a participatory and inclusive framework for
planning, management, implementation, resource allocation and budgeting, supervision, monitoring and
evaluation, reporting and oversight activities. 1 The participatory planning process is known as the fourteen
steps planning process (see figure 1 on the next page), which begins at the community level and moves up
to the national level (NPC and MoF).

All LBs are expected to prepare five year periodic plans in a participatory way, in accordance with NPC
directives. 2 Local periodic plans should meet several criteria:
  − include long term goals, objectives and strategies and cover major functional areas or sectors that
       are devolved to local bodies;
  − include gender, social inclusion, the environment and children as cross-cutting issues in all sectors;
 − be prepared on a spatial basis and on the basis of an analysis of spatial factors;
 − encompass the key elements of sector-specific plans;
 − forecast and take into account resource projections;
 − take into account potential developmental and contributions from central government, NGOs and
       the private sector (which are to be coordinated with LB activities and investments included in LB
       periodic plans);
 − support and complement national plans and contribute to national goals, objectives and overall
       targets.

Based on their periodic plans, LBs are expected to formulate inclusive, participatory, integrated and
comprehensive annual plans. This requires both the communication downwards of resource envelopes and
an upward planning process to prioritize projects from grassroots community groups up to the DDCs. In
terms of downward communication, line ministries are expected to provide their district level departments
with annual budget ceilings, estimate sector grants to LBs and issue guidelines for annual planning. Local
line department and district plans should be consistent with national development policies and plans.
Included in this are MoFALD forecasts of annual conditional and unconditional grants. District Resource
Estimation Committees 3 (DRECs) estimate the total resources that are expected to be available for each
LB in the district for the following year. These resource envelopes (or budget ceilings) are communicated
to the respective LBs. In addition, VDCs and municipalities also have to estimate their respective resource
envelopes. Village, municipal and district councils are required to prepare their respective plans within
their budget ceilings. LBs can submit project proposals for inclusion in the plans of higher tiers in the
inter-governmental system.

The Local Level Planning Process – The Key Steps

Resource forecasts and budget ceilings

•    Line ministries are expected to communicate the annual budget ceilings to their district level line
     departments; this includes information on the estimated sector grant amounts and guidelines for
     annual planning, consistent with more general NPC instructions.
•    Similarly, the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) forecasts annual
     conditional and unconditional grants and communicates the estimated grant amounts to LBs.
•    The District Resource Estimation Committees 4 (DRECs) then estimate the total resources
     (unconditional and conditional grants, own-source revenues, shared revenues, etc.) that are expected
     to be available for each LB (DDC, VDCs and municipalities) in the district for the following fiscal
     year. These resource envelopes, or budget ceilings, are communicated to the respective LBs. VDCs
     and municipalities are also required to provide an estimate of their expected resource envelopes.

Committee.
                                                   10
The annual planning process at the VDC/municipal level

•     After receiving the resource projections/budget ceilings, policy guidelines and a description of the
      priority areas from their VDC/municipality, community organizations (COs), user groups (UGs),
      NGOs and line agencies initiate the planning process at the community level. In the community level
      plan formulation committee meetings community groups submit their priorities to their respective
      Ward Citizen Forums 5 (WCFs).
•     The WCFs then select their priority projects/activities and submit them to their VDC or
      municipality. Priority activities, projects or investments should be classified as:
      - Activities which can be completed/implemented by communities themselves or in partnership
          with other agencies;
      - Activities which can be completed/implemented within the forecasted VDC/municipality budget
          ceiling;
      - Activities which should be referred to the district or central level;
      - Activities which have been carried over from the previous FY.
•     The VDC/municipality then holds an integrated plan formulation committee meeting to:
      - Prioritize among proposed activities and ensure synergy between the different sectoral
          activities/projects submitted by WCFs, taking into account NPC and DDC directives regarding
          national development policies and VDC/municipal periodic plans;
      - Forward the prioritized sectoral activities to village/municipal councils for approval; the
          councils can only approve activities or programs within their jurisdictions and within their
          annual budget ceiling;
      - Review all programs under implementation and determine their linkages with other sectors;
      - Determine which projects/activities should be submitted to the Ilaka level6 to be included in the
          district or national level planning.


The annual planning process at the DDC and national level

•     The plan formulation committees at Ilaka level 7 prioritize among the proposed projects/activities as
      per the policy guidelines and within the limits of the available resources; they then recommend the
      selected priorities to the concerned sectoral plan formulation committees at the district level.
•     The sectoral plan formulation committees further prioritize among the projects/activities submitted
      by the Ilaka plan formulation committees and then forward their recommendations to the DDC.
•     The DDC’s Integrated Plan Formulation Committee (IPFC) reviews the priority proposals submitted
      by the sectoral committees to ensure inter- and intra-sector synergies and to eliminate overlap or
      duplication and sends its recommendations to the DDC.
•     The DDC then classifies the proposed projects into district and central level programs/activities and
      submits the annual district program proposal including recommendations to the district council.
      After verifying that the proposed projects/programs are below the approved budget ceiling, the
      district council approves district level programs and budgets 8; it forwards central level priority
      projects/activities to the concerned line ministries, MoFALD and NPC.

5
   WCFs consist of 25-30 members, selected in an inclusive way to ensure representation of women and
disadvantaged communities. Although WCFs are not provided for in LSGA/R, the RMOM Guidelines (2013) do so
in order to ensure citizen engagement in the local planning process in the absence of Ward Committees.
6
  Ilaka level meetings are scheduled to take place before the end of January each year
7
  Each DDC is divided into 9-17 Ilakas, the exact number depending upon the number of electoral constituencies for
national parliament elections. There are a total of 927 Ilakas in Nepal. Ilakas are no administrative or local
government units and are used only for electoral or district planning purposes.
8
  The district councils are supposed to approve district programs and budgets by mid-March.
                                                           11
•    At the central level, ministries review the district plans for consistency with national sector policies
     and whether they are within the agreed budget ceiling guidelines. In case of inconsistency with the
     guidelines the proposal including directives and/or comments is sent back to the concerned DDCs.
•    Central level line departments and ministries may also ask DDCs to include sector-specific projects
     (identified at the national level) in their annual plans.
•    Taking into account the recommendations/proposals from all DDCs – among other things – the NPC
     consolidates the national level plans. DDCs are informed by the NPC if their recommendations or
     proposals have been incorporated into central level plans.
•    The NPC then approves the national plan and submits it to the MoF which submits the approved
     national plan and annual budget to parliament for approval.

The approved plan should serve as the basis for concerned ministries to authorize budgets for respective
line departments, project offices, DDCs and municipalities. DDCs authorize for VDCs. DDCs request all
concerned implementing agencies to prepare their operational calendars (along with implementation
responsibilities) for program implementation and also request them to prepare funding matrices.

Supervision and monitoring

In line with LSGA provisions, DDCs should form Monitoring Committees under the chairpersonship of an
MP representing the district. If there is more than one MP representing the district, MPs will chair the
committee in alphabetical order. However, few DDCs have followed this. To ensure monitoring, the
RMOM Guidelines (2013) make special provision for the establishment of supervision and monitoring
committees, the meetings of which are to be chaired by the chairpersons of the respective LBs. This
committee monitors whether projects or programs have followed the operational calendar and whether the
funds are used properly or not. The committee is also authorized to monitor outputs every trimester and
submit its report to the LB chair.

                   ANNEX 4: INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL FRAMEWORK


1) Background

The key feature that distinguishes fiscal decentralization from other forms of decentralization is the
constitutional or legal power to raise taxes and carry out service delivery by the lower tiers of
government (Tanzi, 1995). The central government while devolving both expenditure and revenue
responsibilities to lower tiers is also hoping to improve economic efficiency, service delivery and
accountability in local governments (Jenkins, et al., 2000). However, (Oates, 1999) notes that the
relationship between fiscal decentralization and development outcomes is not straightforward.
Additionally, various tenets of fiscal decentralization – expenditure mandates, revenue assignment,
intergovernmental transfers, coordination among tiers – are complex and fraught with challenges.
There is no magic bullet in terms of designing fiscal decentralization which is further complicated by a
country’s history, culture, geography, institutional setting, bureaucracy and politics.

The Local Self Governance Act (1999) provided for a comprehensive transfer of central decision
making power and implementing authority to local bodies in Nepal. However, the LSGA faced several
constraints and challenges which led to the slow decentralization reforms. A total of 23 sector laws
conflicting with the LSGA were never harmonized. As a result, the Nepalese government structure has
remained centralized. This is evident by the own source revenue generated by LBs in Nepal. After 12
years of passing of LSGA, own source revenue generated by LBs was 0.3% of GDP while the central
government’s total revenue has reached 15.7% of GDP in FY 2012/13 9. LBs’ total expenditure as a
percentage of central government expenditure has increased significantly in recent years (reaching
approx. 10%, 12% and 9% of total central government expenditure in FY 2010/11, FY 2011/12 and
FY 2012/13 respectively). However, own source revenue has remained flat, comprising 2% of total
central government revenue in FY 2012/13. 10).

2) Revenue

Revenue Assignments

Major sources of revenue (income tax, VAT, custom, excise etc.) are collected by central government
while minor sources are provided to LBs in Nepal. The LSGA and Local Bodies Fiscal Administration
Regulation (1999) provided that local governments can mobilize resources from different sources:
internal resources (tax and non-tax revenue), revenue sharing, transfers from the central government
and donations/grants from various agencies. Revenue assignment between different tiers of
government is listed in the table below:

Historically, own source revenue (internal revenue) resources account for a small proportion of the
total revenue of LBs in Nepal. In recent years, the share of OSR has been shrinking, resulting in an
increased dependence of LBs on central government transfers to carry out their functions. In FY
2006/07, OSR 11 and fiscal transfers were around 17.5% and 60% of the total revenue respectively. In
FY 2012/13, OSR decreased to 13% while the central government’s grant transfers increased to 83%
of the total revenue (Various LBFC reports and WB Staff estimates). LBs OSR increased by more
than three times between FY 2006/07 to FY 2012/13 while grants increased by more than six times
during this period. As a result, despite the increase of OSR in nominal terms, the percentage of OSR in
total LB revenue has significantly declined in recent years.

     This includes shared revenue of VDCs as disaggregated data was not available for VDCs.

Local bodies’ contribution to total OSR has also been changing over the years. Up until FY 2006/07,
municipalities followed by VDCs were the largest contributors to OSR, which changed starting from
FY 2007/08 when DDCs took over VDCs as the second largest contributor of OSRs. As of FY
2012/13, municipalities and DDCs were the largest contributors of OSR – contributing 47% and 33%
of the total OSR respectively – while VDCs’ share has increased only marginally starting from FY
2010/11.

OSR collection is extremely skewed among the VDCs, districts and municipalities i.e. most of the
OSR are collected by a handful of VDCs, districts and municipalities.

VDC Own Source Revenue

VDC own source revenue (including shared revenue) is a very small component in the total VDC
revenue. Further, its proportion of the total revenue has been declining: from FYs 2006/7 to 2012/13,
OSR (and shared revenue) has declined from 16% to 10% of the total VDC revenue. Moreover,
because of considerable differences in revenue potential across VDCs in the country, this is skewed by
VDCs of a few districts. Most VDCs have extremely low internal revenue generating capacity: in FY
2012/13, the VDCs of 57 districts (i.e. VDCs in 80% of the districts) collected less than 10% of their
revenue from own source. For instance, in FY 2012/13, the internal revenue of VDCs in Kathmandu
district amounted to NRs 179 million while the internal revenue of VDCs in Bajura district was only
NRs 389,000.

DDC Own Source Revenue

Although the LSGA and LSGR assign few OSRs to DDCs compared to VDCs and municipalities (see
table 2 above), the OSR of DDCs has increased both in nominal and comparative terms. In nominal
terms, the OSR of DDCs increased five times in the FYs 2006/07 to FY 2012/13. The DDCs’ share of
OSR of the total LB OSR increased from 20% to 33% during this period. However, the DDCs’ OSR
share as a percentage of their own total revenue has not changed much and remained between 8% to
12% of the total DDC revenue between FYs 2006/07 and FY 2012/13.

Around 55% of the total DDC OSR is generated from tax, the remaining portion is generated from
non-tax revenues. Income from ‘sales’ of sand, boulders, wood and other items (in reality a kind of tax
on the transport of commercial quantities of such items) is the second largest revenue source and
highest non-tax contributor to DDC budgets.

Municipality Own Source Revenue

Municipalities are the largest contributor to OSR among LBs. However, OSR as a share of total
municipal revenue has also been on the decline: from 33% of total municipal revenue in FY 2006/07,
it declined to 18% in FY 2010/11.
Non-tax revenue contributions have been higher than tax revenue in the case of municipalities. In FY
2012/13, tax revenue was only 41% of total OSR, while the remaining share came from non-tax
revenue, service fees being the largest with 42% of the total OSR.

LB Own Source Revenue – Some Issues
     •   Low OSRs for LBs generally and the trend seems to be a further decrease.
     •   LBs have little discretion over determining revenue rates or base.
     •   There are few incentives for LBs to increase OSR and/or tax revenue. Even in the current
         formula for central government grants, only municipalities have direct incentives (see grants
         section below).
     •   Capacity issues are another reason for low LB tax revenue. Even when tax could be a good
         source of income, LBs are unable to determine the optimal tax policy. It also appears that LBs
         have not been sufficiently prepared for managing the revenue assignments transferred to them.
         As for land revenue for instance, VDCs and municipalities face difficulties in handling cadastral
         information, account keeping and other complex administration tasks 12.
     •   Issues with tax administration at the local level: low tax compliance by taxpayers is further
         compounded by problems in enforcement and monitoring enforcement measures.
     •   Unclear, overlapping and ambiguous revenue assignments create confusion on responsibilities,
         jurisdiction and tax rates. For example, tax on rental income from house and land is under the
         tax authority of both, central government and LBs. The central level levies 15% tax on such
         rental, whereas the LSGR permits municipalities to charge 2%. The regulations do not specify
         whether the 2% municipal share is in fact included in the central government tax rate of 15% or
         if municipalities can raise their 2% on top of central governments share. Municipalities have not
         been able to collect any substantial revenue from this source due to this confusion 13.

     2.1) Revenue Sharing

The LSGA 1999 (section 220) and the Local Self Governance Regulation (LSGR, 1999, rule 211)
provide for vertical and horizontal revenue sharing between center and local government or among the
local governments. There are several revenue sharing categories, described in the table below:

Revenue Sharing – DDCs

DDCs share a tax base with central government for the land and registration fee, royalties from mines,
forests and power generation from hydropower plants with the biggest share coming from land
registration followed by hydropower royalties.

Revenue Sharing - VDCs and Municipalities

VDCs share 25% of the collected land revenue with DDCs. Municipalities receive a ‘Local
Development Fee’ (LDF), which is supposed to be a share of the import surcharge (1.5% of the import
value) from the central government. In effect it is actually a grant not tied to import surcharges. The
LDF was devised in 1999, originally as temporary measure to compensate municipalities for the
revenue loss as a result of the abolishment of the octroi. However, it has become one of the largest
sources of revenue for municipalities. Its reporting has been inconsistent over the years and there is
confusion over whether it is a central transfer or shared revenue.

Revenue sharing issues:
  •   Contradictory provisions regarding responsibilities for tax collection in the LSGA and other
      related regulations, for example on royalty collection for tourist entrance fees, royalties from
      mines, forests and power generation from hydropower plants, the house rental tax, land
      registration fee, land revenue and the motor vehicle tax (Pandey, 2008, p. 43) (page 20,
      Shrestha, 2002). This creates conflicting and unclear assignment of responsibilities between
      central government and LBs as well as among LBs.
  •   Overlaps between jurisdictions is a major problem; between DDCs and VDCs/municipalities as
      well as between central government and DDCs.
  •   Ambiguities regarding the revenue base, rate and the applicable sharing mechanism.
  •   Delays in transfers of shared revenues from central government.
  •   Revenue sharing bias towards central government in some cases: As for the registration fees
      shared between central government and DDCs, the DDC share is capped at 6 million NRs. The
      excess amount is kept by central government (Shrestha 2002, page 25)

Vertical Imbalance

Vertical imbalance is defined as ‘a mismatch between expenditure functions that local governments
have been assigned and their access to locally generated finances to fund activities to meet their
mandates’ (Bhatta, 2011, p. 3). Vertical imbalances are common since major sources of revenue are
typically administered more efficiently and with less distortions at the national level and hence
assigned to the central government. From the discussion on revenue assignments and expenditure
mandates above, it is evident that there is high vertical imbalance for LBs in Nepal. For instance, in
FY 2012/13, LB own source revenue accounted for a mere 2% of the total central government
revenue. LB OSR (including shared revenue) of the total LB revenue was 17% (also FY 2012/13) and
the deficit of 83% was covered by central government transfers (calculated based on LBFC 2013).

Horizontal Imbalance

Horizontal imbalance is the mismatch ‘in the resource capacity of local governments; it is a function
of different spatial, resource base, and other factors’ (Bhatta, 2011, p. 3). LBs in Nepal face
considerable differences in revenue potential and tax capacities, largely due to the diverse
geographical conditions in the country. For example, there is a stark difference in the availability of
natural resources, the demographic patterns and economic base, in districts in the mountain, hill and
Terai regions. This greatly influences LB revenue generating capacity. Not surprisingly, tax collection
rates per capita are very unequal among LBs.

There is also great variation in expenditure needs of LBs in Nepal, again due to their diversity in size,
population, cost of service provision, level of economic development and accessibility. It is therefore
important that central government transfers take into account these diverse conditions and differences
in LB revenue generating capacity through an appropriate and well-accepted transfer formula. The
various transfers currently being used in Nepal are discussed in the following section.


                                                   26
Intergovernmental Transfers

Overall, intergovernmental fiscal transfers to LBs have been growing significantly in Nepal in both
nominal terms and as a proportion of total revenue. In nominal terms, grants increased from NRs 5.6
billion in FY 2006/07 to more than NRs 30 billion in FY 2012/13, i.e. over five times in six years
(Source: LBFC reports and WB Staff Estimates). As a proportion of total revenue, grants transferred
to LBs in FY 2006/07 accounted for 60% and increased to 82% of total revenue in FY 2012/13. In
comparison, OSR decreased from 17% to 12% of total revenue during the same period, although in
nominal terms OSR tripled. This shows that fiscal transfers have grown substantially, particularly
comparing them to OSR.

       Figure 7: VDC, DDC and Municipality shares in fiscal transfers (FYs 2006/07-2012/13)




            Figure 8: Proportion of OSR, shared revenue and grants of LBs (FY 2012/13)




Intergovernmental fiscal transfers in Nepal fit into two broad categories: grants and social payments.
Social payments (or social transfers), such as payments to senior citizens, persons with disabilities the
disabled, endangered ethnicities, single women security scheme, etc., are transferred to LBs under a
separate budget line (different from the one for grants).
There are two types of grants provided by central government to LBs:
 i) Conditional grants: recurrent and capital grants.
 ii) Unconditional grants: also known as block grants which can be for recurrent or capital
      expenditures. The unconditional capital grant has two sub-categories: the minimum block grant
      and a formula based block grant.

                                                   27
Conditional Grants
Conditional grants are specific purpose grants, the central government specifying the purpose for
which the recipient LB can use the funds. Conditional grants can be recurrent or capital and are one
way to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure and maintain fiscal equity among LBs.
However, conditional grants limit the fiscal discretion of LBs and also affect their budget allocation
decisions (Shrestha, 2002). Conditional grants are mostly tied to education, roads and other
infrastructure spending in Nepal.

Unconditional Grants (Block Grants)
Unconditional grants, also known as block grants in Nepal, provide largely discretionary revenue to
LBs. They can be recurrent or capital. Capital block grants can be further divided into two main types:
i)    Minimum block grants: LBs receive an annual ‘minimum block grant’ for capital expenditures;
      VDCs receive between NRs 1.5 million and 3 million depending on criteria such as population or
      poverty levels, while DDCs all receive a flat amount of NRs 3 million.
ii)   Formula and performance based block grants: in addition to the minimum block grant, LBs are
      provided with additional grants; these are allocated based on a) an allocation formula and b) the
      performance of LBs (evaluated against a set of indicators – the minimum conditions and
      performance measures, or MC/PMs).
      The allocation formula includes criteria which seek to take into account and equalize the
      considerably different conditions in LBs, such as population, area, poverty level, cost index and
      capacity for own source revenue generation (Local Body Fiscal Commission, 2005; Bhatta,
      2011). The following criteria are used for allocating these grants:
      − For DDCs: (i) population–40%, (ii) weighted poverty–25%, (iii) area–10%, and (iv) weighted
          cost–25%.
      − For municipalities: (i) population–50%, (ii) weighted poverty–25%, (iii) area–10%, and `(iv)
          weighted tax effort–15%.
      − For VDCs: (i) population–60%, (ii) area–10%, and (iii) weighted cost–30%.

      The allocation of the additional formula and performance based block grants to LBs is dependent
      on the fulfillment of meeting certain minimum requirements (e.g. proper financial management)
      and performance measures, trying to incentivize LB compliance with legal provisions and good
      performance. The MC/PM indicators are based on legal and financial management requirements
      to which LBs must adhere.




                                                  28
                                      Box 1: Performance Based Block Grants
      In 2004 a UNCDF/DfID supported program (the Decentralized Financing and Development Program –
      DFDP) started piloting a performance based grants funding mechanism in 20 districts for capital
      development grants provided to DDCs by the program. Annual assessments of pilot districts’ performance
      evaluated against a set of indicators (the so-called minimum conditions and performance measures –
      MC/PMs) were introduced. Pilot districts had to pass certain access conditions (minimum conditions) to
      be eligible for the program grant. In addition, the actual size of the grant was dependent on the districts’
      performance on the performance measure criteria; i.e. good performance in PM areas increased the grant
      share, while poor performance reduced the amount allocated.
      Generally, MCs function as minimum safeguards for proper utilization of public resources and for
      identifying the basic absorption capacity and financial discipline. The objective of the additional criteria,
      the performance measures, is to provide incentives for improved performance in a number of areas that
      are seen as priorities (e.g. by government, donors etc.). While seeking to improve performance, MC/PM
      assessments, at the same time, can be a useful tool to identify capacity gaps that can be addressed
      specifically when performance assessments are linked up with capacity building mechanisms.
      The performance based funding system in Nepal (in some variation) has been rolled out to all LBs in the
      last years and applies to the GoN unconditional block grants provided to LBs. DDCs and municipalities
      are evaluated on the basis of both, MCs and PMs. Currently, DDCs have to pass 9 and municipalities 10
      MCs to be eligible for the block grant. DDC performance is assessed on 46 and municipalities’ on 40 PM
      indicators, determining the actual size of their respective block grant allocation. VDC performance is
      assessed on the basis of 7 MCs. In 2013 PM indicators (13) have also been introduced for VDCs. The
      MC/PM assessment process is now carried out every three years.
      A total of 64 DDCs, 54 municipalities and 3,407 VDCs passed the MC criteria in the last performance
      evaluation carried out in FY 2012/13 (Economic Survey, 2013).


VDC grants
VDCs have been receiving block grants since 1996. Over the years the amounts have been increased:
  o Until FY 2006/07, VDCs each received NRs 0.5 million.
  o From FY 2007/08, VDC grants were increased to NRs 1 million per VDC.
  o From FY 2009/10, VDC grants have been provided based on a formula (population, VDC
      area, population and cost) and range from NRs 1.5 million to 3 million per VDC.
Since 2009, all 3,915 VDCs have been receiving a minimum grant amount of NRs 1.5 million each.
VDCs that pass a number of basic minimum conditions (MCs) are allocated an additional grant
amount. Additional grants are supposed to be used for programs that directly benefit particular target
groups. In FY 2012/12, for example, 3,407 VDCs passed the MCs and were provided with additional
grants (mostly from donors foreign grants) based on the indicators.

DDC grants
DDCs are provided with a minimum capital grant of NRs 3 million. The allocation of the additional
formula based grant is dependent on the compliance with the MC/PM indicators. There are 9 MC
criteria and 46 PM criteria for DDCs currently. A total of 64 DDCs had passed the MC criteria in in
the last performance evaluation carried out in FY 2012/13. The allocation formula takes into account
population, geographical region, area, cost and poverty criteria.

Issues with Grants
Equity: VDCs used to receive equal amounts (in nominal terms) of transfers, despite the huge
variations in their local conditions and thus needs. To address this problem, VDC grant allocations
have been revised and are provided based on a formula since FY 2009/10, with grant allocations
between NRs 1 - 3 million. Given the great disparity among VDCs in Nepal and the difficulties to
capture and equalize this through the VDC grant allocation formula there are questions on the equity
of the current distribution mechanism.


                                                       29
Creating the right incentives: Earlier, municipalities generating more than NRs 10 million OSR were
not eligible for receiving a development grant, in effect creating a disincentive for municipalities to
increase their OSR. This was changed with the introduction of the new transfer formula which
provides incentives for better revenue collection. Incentives regarding revenue generating capacity of
VDCs and DDCs have not yet been explicitly included in grant formula or MC/PMs for VDCs and
DDCs.
Late and unpredictable transfers: Delays in fund transfers are a common issue, compromising the
proper utilization of grants. There is a consistent delay in issuing authorization letters for fiscal
transfers by the central government, often taking three to six months. Also, the total annual grant
amount allocated to a LB is transferred in 3 separate tranches, rather than just one early on in the FY
which further exacerbates the problem of delays in authorization letter issuance and grant transfers.
Apart from other problems these delays in the fund flow cause, it also creates an incentive for LBs to
move resources that have not been spent by the end of a FY to a ‘non-freezing’ account in order to
avoid having to return unspent funds to the central treasury. This creates incentives for doubtful
financial management practice, even though there may not be an intention to engage in malpractice.
As other coping strategies for anticipated fund transfer delays LBs have been providing advances to
user groups or contractors, or pre-financing user group activities before final project approval. The
delays make it very challenging for LBs to provide efficient quality services and follow financial
management rules.

Expenditures
Overall, total LB expenditure has increased from NRs 13 billion in FY 2007/08 to NRs 31 billion in
FY 2012/13 14. Despite this significant increase in nominal terms, total LB expenditure as a % of total
central government expenditure has remained around 10%, with a high point of 12% in FY 2011/12.

                    Figure 9: LB expenditure as % of total central government expenditure




However, there have been considerable changes in expenditure patterns, particularly with regard to
spending on transfers. LBs manage or execute expenditures from three major sources of revenue:
OSR, shared revenue and fiscal transfers. Fiscal transfers are further divided into grants and social
payments.
LB expenditure on transfers has increased from 7.2% in FY 2007/08 to 10.3% of total central
government expenditure in FY 2012/13. While grants to LBs have increased by three times during that
period, social payments have increased by eight times. As a percentage of total central government
expenditure, social payments have increased from 0.7% to 2.5%, and grants from 6.5% to 7.7%.

                         Figure 10: LB transfers: grants and social payments




Within the grants system, there have been major shifts with regard to recurrent and capital
expenditures, indicating a worrisome trend. In FY 2007/08, capital expenditure accounted for 80% of
total LB grants. This has dropped to 67% in FY 2012/13. This figure does not include social payments.
Social payments are effectively handouts and can also be considered as recurrent expenditure.
Including social payments in the above calculation, LB capital expenditure accounted for 71% (instead
of 80%) of total LB grant expenditure in FY 2007/08, dropping to 53% in FY 2012/13.

               Figure 11: Share of recurrent grants, capital grants and social payments




Social payments have increased by 9 times in 5 years – from NRs 0.9 billion in FY 2006/07 to 8.5
billion in FY 2011/12 in nominal terms. Accounting for only about 7% of total LB expenditure in FY
2007/08, social payments have now become almost one third of the total LB expenditure.
As for recurrent expenditures – on average, recurrent expenditures for municipalities have been around
25% between FYs 2007/08 - 2010/11. Looking closer at individual municipalities though, some show
very high recurrent expenditure figures and there are huge variations across municipalities. For
example, the average recurrent expenditure of Nepalgunj municipality was 51% between FYs 2007/08
- 2010/11, so much higher than the municipality average of 25%. 51% of the total recurrent

                                                 31
expenditure is incurred by only seven municipalities and the other 49% by the remaining 51
municipalities.
Regarding municipal capital expenditure – 36% of the total capital expenditure was incurred by five
municipalities alone (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Birjung, Biratnagar and Pokhara) on average between FYs
2007/08 - FY 2010/11.
Unconditional and conditional grants have seen less of a change in the last few years. In FY 2012/13,
unconditional grants accounted for 53% and conditional grants for 46% of total LB grants. In FY
2007/08 this was at 57% for unconditional and 43% for conditional grants.
The two charts below illustrate these changes in fiscal transfer compositions. It can be seen, that in FY
2012/13 unconditional grants to LBs constituted about 40% and conditional grants and social
payments combined (earmarked grants) about 60% of total LB fiscal transfers.

        Figure 12: Share of unconditional, conditional and social payments to LBs (FY 2012)




             Figure 13: Share of conditional and unconditional grants and social payments




Another trend that can be observed in LB expenditure patterns is the occurrence of unspent funds. LBs
are usually unable to spend the full amount of allocated grants or OSR by the end of the FY. This has
been a recurring problem and has not seen any improvement over the years – on the contrary: in FY
2002/03, unspent funds of all LBs amounted to about NRs 2 billion, increasing to NRs 6 billion by FY
2012/13. DDCs account for the largest portion of these unspent resources, followed by VDCs and
municipalities.



                                                   32

                                                                             Source: LBFC Reports



There are several reasons for this trend. One is the low absorption capacity of LBs. Another is that
transfers from the central government the late and unpredictable fund transfers from central
government. As explained above, there are consistent delays in transferring funds to LBs. Funds
usually take three to six months to reach LBs and the last tranche of the allocated amount is often
received only a few months, or even weeks, before the end of the FY. There even have been instances
of funds reaching only in the last week of the FY, creating considerable difficulties for LBs to spend
these before the end of the FY.
Of all LBs, VDCs are most reliant on grants. On average, more than 90% of VDC expenditure is
covered by central government transfers, meaning only 10% of total VDC expenditures are covered by

13% in the Terai region.

                                 DISTRICTS


Background and Scope of Work
The survey carried out by ‘Solutions’ (a survey firm) collected quantitative and qualitative data about
the service delivery outcomes in Dhankuta and Dhanusa districts. It was conducted in 5 VDCs and one
municipality in 2 districts pre-selected by the World Bank. The households were regarded as the basic
sampling unit. The below table lists the VDCs and municipalities that were covered by the survey,
along with their total population as well as the total number of households in that area and the sample
size proposed for each of the areas. The fieldwork entailed a questionnaire based survey to collect data
and information with respect to service outcomes in the education and roads sectors. The survey was
undertaken in a single round in March-April 2014.

Respondent Selection Process
Each of the VDCs was divided into 4-10 segments, depending on the settlement pattern and spread
within, with households in each segment. The field team then chose segments using a random number
table. The index houses for interview within the chosen segment were identified using the ‘spin the
bottle’ method. The field team then walked in the direction that the bottle pointed to, counting houses
within 20 meters on either side of their path until they reached the edge of the cluster and randomly
chose (with help of a random number table) a number ‘x’ between 1 and the total number of houses
counted to identify the index house for interview. After locating the household, the interviewers then
selected every 3rd house to their left.
In each selected household, an adult member with a recent birthday and 18 years and above was
interviewed. Only one eligible respondent per household was chosen for the questionnaire assuming
that local service delivery within a household is similar even if there were more than one eligible
respondent in the same household.

General Profile of the Respondents
Of the respondents interviewed, a majority of them (42.2%) were between the age of 30-39 years
followed by around one forth who were between the age of 40-49 years. Although the overall
proportion of male and female respondents were almost equal, the majority respondents from the
municipalities were females. However, at the VDC level, the proportion of male respondents was
observed to be the highest (90%) in Labatoli VDC of Dhanusa district. Among the total respondents
interviewed more than 95% of them were married and most of them were Hindu (83.5%). It was
observed that the ethnic/caste composition of the two districts was different. Across the two districts,
most of the respondents from Dhankuta were adibasi/janajatis whereas the proportion of the same was
minimal in Dhanusa district. It was observed that the majority of respondents from Dhanusa belonged
to the Dalit or disadvantaged community. Dhankuta was seen to be more homogenous in terms of
ethnic/caste groups, with the exception of Bhirgaun VDC. In comparison to Dhankuta, Dhanusa was
found to be more diverse in terms of ethnic group composition.

Perceptions of Education Outputs and Outcomes
One of the objectives of the survey was to assess the condition of local service delivery in different
VDCs and the municipality of the two districts in terms of the quality of schools and education in
general. Hence the respondents were first asked if they had any school age children or children
enrolled from class 1 to 10 in their households. The enrollment rate was observed to be high in both
                                                  38
the rural and urban areas with over 95% of the households mentioning that they had children going to
school. It was observed that 5% of the households had only some or none of their children going to
school for which the most common reason stated was that the kids did not show interest in going to
school. The other reasons stated for non-attendance are listed in Table 19.1. At the VDC/municipality
level, it was seen that the non-enrollment rates were relatively more significant in Basbitti, Lohana and
Sapahi VDCs of Dhanusa. It was observed that many children in these VDCs from a Muslim
background attend Madrassas (religious schools) which have not been legally authorized by the
government and haven’t been considered as schools in this survey.

The respondents were also asked to give their opinion on the overall quality of primary education
provided by public schools in their localities. Around 56% replied that the quality was around average.
Almost one third of the respondents rated the quality of primary education as good with slight
variations across the two districts. Regarding their opinion on the quality of secondary education
provided by the public schools, around half of the respondents across all the VDCs and municipalities
in the two districts felt that the quality was average and 35.7% felt that the quality was good. A
relatively higher proportion of respondents from Dhankuta perceived the quality of secondary
education provided by public schools to be good in comparison to the respondents in Dhanusa.
                                                                               40
At the VDC/municipality level, it was observed that the respondents of Lohana and Sapahi in Dhanusa
had the most negative view on the quality of primary public schools. Additionally, the respondents of
Sapahi VDC had the most negative perception of secondary public schools. The most positive views
about both primary and secondary public schools were expressed by respondents in Rajarani, where
almost 3/4 mentioned that the secondary schools were good or very good. Overall, it was seen that the
respondents in Dhankuta had a more positive opinion about the quality of public schools, with over
40% regarding the quality to be good or very good in all localities with the exception of Bhirgaun.
Similarly, the respondents were asked to assess the overall quality of primary and secondary education
provided by private schools in their localities. Over one third of the VDC respondents in Dhankuta
mentioned that there were no private schools providing primary education in their locality. Over half
of the VDC respondents from Dhankuta mentioned that private schools providing secondary education
were also not available in their locality. However, it has to be noted that those respondents who were
aware of the quality of primary or secondary education being provided by private schools were mostly
positive and perceived that the quality of education provided was good or very good. In comparison to
public schools, a relatively higher proportion of respondents perceived the quality of education (both
primary and secondary) provided by private schools as good or very good.
Overall, 15-20% of the respondents were seen to be more satisfied with the quality of private than with
public schools, both primary and secondary. Apparently, there were no private schools in Bhirgaun
and Vedetar, while in Rajarani VDC of Dhankuta there is no private secondary school.

Responsibility for Ensuring Quality Education
It was observed that around half of the respondents regarded the School Management Committee to be
the most responsible for the quality of both primary and secondary education in their
VDC/municipality. The District Education Office was somewhat regarded as the second important
entity after the School Management Committee to be responsible for the quality of education,
particularly by the respondents of Dhanusa. Even within Dhanusa district, a significant proportion of
respondents of Labatoli and Umaprempur VDCs regarded the DEO as being the second most
important entity after the School Management Committee responsible for quality education.
Most of the respondents felt that the VDC/municipality officials are only little to somewhat concerned
about the quality of education with variations across the two districts. Over half of the respondents of
VDCs in Dhanusa stated that these officials were not concerned about the quality of education at all.
The responses in Dhankuta indicate that the population thinks that the VDC is concerned about the
quality of education, in particular in Vedetar and Rajarani VDCs. Whereas in Dhanusa the majority of
respondents in Lohana and Janakpur perceive that the VDC/municipality does not care about the
quality of education while other VDCs in this district have a more positive view.
The question whether respondents felt that the DDC officials were concerned about the quality of
education, around one fourth were not able to answer while over one fourth felt that they were
somewhat concerned. In Dhankuta, similar to respondents’ views on VDCs, there is a sense that the
DDC cares about education, whereas in Dhanusa about half the respondents in Lohana and in Janakpur
perceive that DDC officials do not care about the quality of education.

The respondents were also asked if people in their village/community area were able to influence the
quality of education. Over 42% replied that they were not able to do so. Over 36% of the respondents
mentioned that they did not know if they would be able to influence the quality of education.
Similarly, almost half of the respondents were of the view that the village and community members
are not able to influence the spending on education in their VDC/municipality. However, it was
observed that the proportion of respondents who believed that they could influence the quality of
education in their VDC/municipality was higher than those who felt that they could influence spending
on education. Across the VDCs and municipality, the majority of respondents of Pakhribas,
Hathikharka, Lohana and Janakpur VDCs/municipality feel that they cannot influence the quality or
the spending on education.

Normative Institutional Framework

1.1. General regulatory and policy framework for the local roads sector

Local body functional responsibilities in the local roads sector are specified in the following legal and
regulatory texts:
• The Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA, 1999) – articles 28 (for VDCs), 96 (for Municipalities)
    and 128 (for DDCs) specify LB functional assignments, which include local roads and transport
    infrastructure. Article 243 specifies that the concerned line ministries are expected to assist LBs in
    the planning and implementation of their development programs.
• LSGR (2000) and LBFAR (2007) provide more detailed operational and financial management
    rules, applicable to all LB activities (including those related to the local roads sector).
• The Local Infrastructure Development Policy (LIDP, 2004), which assigns LB responsibilities in
    seven local infrastructure sub-sectors:
- Local transport: district and rural/agriculture roads, municipal roads, helipads, suspension bridges,
    bridges and culverts along district and rural/agricultural roads, foot and mule tracks, ropeways,
    cable cars, etc.;
- Irrigation and river control;
- Micro-hydro and alternative energy;
- Water supply & sanitation;
- Housing and urban development;
- Solid waste management;
- Social infrastructure (community buildings, health, education, etc.).

The LIDP further classifies local infrastructure as:
- Village level infrastructure: infrastructure programs that are included in village periodic and
   annual plans, as approved by village councils;
- Municipal level infrastructure: infrastructure programs which that are included in municipal
   periodic and annual plans, as approved by municipal councils;
- District level infrastructure: infrastructure programs which are not included in VDC or municipal
   programs and thus fall under the district periodic and annual plans, approved by district councils.

The LIDP also assigns local infrastructure sector sub-functions (e.g. policy and planning, setting
   technical norms and standards, design and costing, procurement, etc.) to central and local
   governments.

•   The National Transport Policy (2002) classifies the local transport system as consisting of district
    roads, village roads, agriculture roads, municipal roads and major foot trails. These local roads and
    trails are devolved to LBs for implementation within their respective jurisdictions.

1.2. Institutional stakeholders in the local roads sector

Table 7 below provides a list of the principal institutional stakeholders in the local roads sector at
central government, district and village/municipal levels, as well as a summary of their main roles and
responsibilities within the sector.

1.3. Planning in the local roads sector

Planning in the local roads sector follows largely the general planning process which is described in
annex 2, at least as far as LB resources from own source, shared revenue and unconditional block
grants are concerned. The authority of LBs in the road sector is constrained, though, by a variety of
different programmes and conditions attached to earmarked roads sector funding, some of them
providing funding in a rather ad hoc fashion which does not leave much room for planning to take

                                                   112
place. Therefore, the ways in which local roads sector activities are planned and implemented by LBs
appear to vary according to the source of funding in practice.

In some cases work on local roads is carried out separately by the Department of Roads. District
Technical Offices (DTOs in DDCs are expected to provide all LBs with technical support. In practice,
they tend to direct their limited capacity to district level roads and to GoN and donor-funded sector
programs. The construction and maintenance of local roads are dominated by user committees (UCs)
except for DoR roads, which are usually given to private contractors.

See table 1 on the next page for a list of the principal institutional stakeholders in the local roads sector
and a summary of their main roles and responsibilities within the sector, including those for planning.
