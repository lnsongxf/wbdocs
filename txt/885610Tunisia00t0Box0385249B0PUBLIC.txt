I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Tunisia
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Tunisia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Tunisia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Tunisia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Tunisia; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Tunisia.

       Use data to help inform the Tunisia country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In June thru August 2012, 133 stakeholders of the World Bank in Tunisia were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
departments, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 58
stakeholders participated in the country survey (44%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned it similarly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Tunisia, their overall attitudes toward the Bank, the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results, the Bank’s knowledge, working with the World Bank, the
Bank’s future role in Tunisia, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Tunisia.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

    A. General Issues facing Tunisia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Tunisia was
       headed in the right or wrong direction, the three most important development priorities,
       and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generate economic
       growth.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Tunisia, Bank staff preparedness,
   the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Tunisia, with which groups the Bank should work
   more in Tunisia, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Tunisia, the extent to
   which the Bank meets Tunisia’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and
   the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-one development areas, such as economic
   growth. Respondents were also asked to indicate the greatest obstacles to more effective
   governance and greater job creation in Tunisia and the areas related to governance and job
   creation on which the Bank should spend greater attention.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Tunisia: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Tunisia in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Tunisia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate whether the
   government is doing enough to increase civil society participation in Tunisia, the greatest
   obstacles to greater civil society participation, where they get information about economic
   and social development issues, how they prefer to receive information from the Bank, their
   access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website and PICs.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the
   Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Tunisia, and their geographic location.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Tunisia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Tunisia. The one area
        determined to be the key driver from these analyses was:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Tunisia, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at public financial management;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework.

stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in TUNISIA. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in TUNISIA. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
