      Other factors may contribute to the unsuccessful reforms or no reforms at all:


       •	 Lack of national policy – constant change, no planning or measuring of results of activities.
       •	 Lack of strategy or prioritization of activities.
       •	 Trend to avoid changes by insisting on the “special situation in the country,” which requires international standards to be adjusted to
          local circumstances.
       •	 Inconsistent implementation of measures – relying on certification, which may not be based on the estimation of the efficacy of the
          system in place, but instead controlling only the formal side (documentation, paperwork).
       •	 Adoption of regulations with no follow up implementing measures – businesses may implement measures according to their own will
          and inconsistency is a problem.
       •	 Lack of sustainability in measures – highly dependent on foreign experts and funds.
       •	 Procurement problems/purchase of low quality equipment for governmental agencies’
       •	 Funds allocated for food safety reallocated to other sectors due to some emergencies or to a political decision.
       •	 Lack of division of responsibilities, constant disputes and transferring of responsibilities from one agency to another.
       •	 Lack of capacities in the national scientific community and no efforts to develop them.
       •	 Lack of public awareness on the importance of food safety for public health.
       •	 Manipulation information and depriving public the access to information.
