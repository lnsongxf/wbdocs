Investment in Africa’s health systems is key to inclusive and sustainable growth.                                                                                             Health expenditure in Africa have increased significantly, but domestically financed government

Strong economic growth in recent years has helped reduce poverty to 43 percent of the population.
Yet, as Africa’s population expands—it is estimated to reach 2.5 billion by 2050—the region faces a critical                                                                  Total health expenditure has grown rapidly over the last two decades, in particular in middle-income

high levels of child and maternal mortality, malnutrition is far too common, and most health systems are                                                                      development assistance, about half of which was earmarked spending for HIV/AIDS. In contrast,

Coverage (UHC)—the principle that everyone receives needed health services without financial hardship.                                                                        government spending in 2014. Limited commitment of domestic resources is often reflected in shortages

Investing in UHC pays off.
                                                                                                                                                                              Coverage of key health services has increased but critical gaps remain.
The primary reason for investing in UHC is a moral one: it is not acceptable that some members of
society should face death, disability, ill health or impoverishment for reasons that could be addressed at                                                                    Africa has seen rapid improvement in coverage of insecticide treated bed nets for children, which
limited cost. However, UHC is also a good investment. Prevention of malnutrition and ill health is likely                                                                     accounts for an important share of the decline in child mortality. Other indicators related to maternal and

which in turn will result in higher rates of economic growth and more rapid poverty reduction. And strong                                                                     to HIV, TB, and malaria services also remains uneven and is lower than for other core indicators of UHC
