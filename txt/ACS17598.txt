Executive Summary
Background and Rationale
1. This report summarizes the results, lessons and recommendations to the Government of
Lao PDR from two Technical Assistance projects (TA) “Supporting Demand Creation for
Sanitation through Community Led Total Sanitation” (P132453), and “Sanitation Marketing
in Lao PDR” (P132249), carried out by the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program
between October 2012 and December 2015.

2. Access to improved sanitation facilities in Lao PDR has increased considerably over
recent years, from 28% in 2000 to 71% in 2015. In 2015, 94% of the urban population has
access to an improved latrine, while only 56% of the rural population does. Among the rural
population, stark inequalities exist across regions and among ethnic and socio-economic
groups. Only 13% of the poorest quintile has access to an improved toilet, compared to 100%
of the richest quintile. Poor sanitation is associated with high levels of malnutrition,
especially with stunting (49% of rural children were stunted in 2011).

Objective and Outcomes
3. The development objective of the TAs was to increase improved sanitation and hygiene
practices and change community behavior to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status at
the village level. This was achieved through three key interventions achieving below
outcomes.

a)         Developing scalable models for demand creation through Community-Led Total
           Sanitation (CLTS)
          Capacity building for CLTS was strengthened at all levels; a pool of 25 national
           CLTS master trainers was set-up and now deliver training of trainers across the
           country; 469 provincial and district level officials were trained in CLTS related
           topics.
          National CLTS capacity building packages were developed and adopted; based on
           operational guidelines1, a national CLTS toolkit was issued and is being used by 10
           NGOs across 31 districts in 10 provinces, and a CLTS curriculum was developed for
           the University of Health and Science, to start in academic year 2017/2018.
          CLTS process was piloted within Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) project; partnership
           agreement signed for 40 villages; roles and responsibilities articulated in PRF’s
           standard operating procedures.
          CLTS took place in 266 villages2 in the 2 provinces, resulting in a 32 percent increase
           in sanitation access in triggered villages from Jul 2014 to Feb 2016, an annual rate of
           change 8 times as fast as the national rural average (2.6 percent/year). Out of the 266
           villages at least 53 percent (or 141 villages) were ethnic minority villages in remote
           areas (Annex A). A total of 113 villages (43 per cent) were declared ODF and almost
           40,000 people gained access.

b)         Strengthening supply chain for affordable and aspirational sanitation products and
           services

      •    Aspirational and affordable latrine products were developed including an easy-to-
           clean pour-flush toilet costing LAK 500,000- 650,000 (USD 60-80)3.
      •    12 enterprises were trained in latrine manufacturing and business skills in the two
           provinces, 10 remain active; ‘one-stop-shop’ model was introduced to simplify latrine
           purchasing for households; 102 sales agents trained, with 10 percent remaining active.
           A total of 1,465 toilets were sold to date by 10 enterprises.
      •    A sanitation marketing toolkit was produced to align sanitation marketing approaches
           and facilitate future replication in other regions.

           Developing and supporting implementation of behavior change communication
           (BCC) strategies
      •    BCC tools are under development (ready by June 2016); the process was led as a
           sector-wide effort led by Nam Saat4 to facilitate wide uptake.


Key Lessons Learned
A rich set of lessons resulted from the technical assistance, of which the following are
highlighted:

Institutional Strengthening                             Operational Aspects

Forging a partnership with different agencies           Leadership from district and village authorities
that have a strong presence on the ground, such         for rural sanitation is critical; a clear
as PRF and Lao Women Union will enable                  understanding of their respective roles in
district-wide implementation at scale. Crucial is       planning, monitoring, demand creation/CLTS,
to maintain Nam Saat’s mandate and                      behavior change and market facilitation is
accountability for delivery of sanitation services      essential; capacity building efforts should match
in such partnerships.                                   these roles.

Supporting provinces and districts with practical       Given the lack of microcredit for rural
planning and budgeting tools has helped to              households, saving preferences for sanitation,
develop realistic implementation plans and              and difficulties to motivate villagers with
mobilize a minimum level of operational budget          previous random supply-led subsidies, a
on sanitation activities. However, a better             harmonized policy for pro-poor support is
articulation of rural sanitation budget-line is         urgently needed. This should be well targeted
required.                                               and delivered without undermining the nascent
                                                        market.
Advocacy and pro-active engagement of                   Sanitation entrepreneurs have benefited from
provincial and district senior decision makers          close collaboration with districts and village
and administrators is critical to harness support       chiefs, while sales agents are best recruited
for resource allocation for sanitation activities at    among village volunteers to avoid conflict of
a local level. National top-level dialogue is           interest with public roles. Due to the nascent
required to support sub-national allocation             market, external support to businesses remains
mechanisms.                                             needed in the short term and can best be
                                                        delivered through efficient sector-wide NGO
                                                        market facilitation.

Recommendations and Way Forward
i.       Development of a national rural sanitation sub-program with dedicated budget line
         under MoH
Rather than as a sparsely funded sub-activity under MoH’s national program on Health and
Hygiene Promotion, a program on rural sanitation and hygiene would need to be established.5
The program budget – in addition to salaries - would have to cover expenditures for basic
operational costs, CLTS and BCC activities, pro-poor incentives, monitoring and other
indirect sector coordination cost. The development of a harmonized financing guideline will
need to be part of such program, articulating a policy for pro-poor support and incentives for
village ODF achievement in the context of the existing inequalities in access. To meet the
national sanitation access target of 80 per cent by 2020, over 200,000 people would need to
gain access annually (2017-2020). This translates into a minimum budget requirement of
USD2.3-2.8 million annually, or USD10.8 million over the 2017-2020 period (an annual
investment of USD 14 per capita). It assumes that USD3.8 million is allocated over this
period for targeted subsidies to the poor6, USD1 million for ODF-awards, and the remaining
55 percent for software expenditures.7

ii.      Integration of the rural sanitation program within multi-sectoral nutrition programs
         and the government’s nutrition Social and Behavior Change Communications
         Strategy

With increased funding for nutrition, including the World Bank-funded Health Governance
and Nutrition Development (HGNDP) project, as well as USAID and EU/UNICEF support,
there is a huge opportunity to integrate rural sanitation activities in these programs. Such
integration can help maximize the use of the national toolkits, e.g. the CLTS and BCC
materials and training manuals developed under these TAs, and deliver important efficiencies
in scaling-up.
iii.    Tailoring gender and ethnic minority issues into Behavior Change Communications
        Strategy
To further supporting the government’s efforts on improving rural sanitation among ethnic
minorities living in poor and remote areas, sanitation interventions such as behavior change
communications strategy should be supporting them to overcome physical, social and cultural
barriers. Motivators for stopping open defecation and perceived benefits of latrine usages
were found to be similar among different ethnic groups. The ongoing BCC tools production
has incorporated motivators addressed to both men and women among different ethnic
groups, to ensure identification and comprehension is good. Because literacy especially
among ethnic groups is low, the BCC material package is mostly visual so that it can be
widely used among various ethnic groups. It is expected that the government will apply the
BCC package into their future programs across the sector such as nutrition, Model Healthy
Village and education.

iv.      Mobilization of high-level support and funding commitment to scale-up sanitation
         service delivery through Poverty Reduction Fund

5
  This could also include rural water supply, however, the government is currently considering the transfer of the
rural water supply mandate to the newly created Department of Water Supply under Ministry of Public Works
and Transport.
6
  This assumes a subsidy of USD 40 per households, to be used by 24,000 households annually.
7
  This budget estimate does not include the recurrent administration and salary costs of government at different
levels nor external TA for market development.
                                                        3
Informed by the lessons of the pilot partnership between Nam Saat and PRF, a realistic scale-
up plan needs to be developed, reflecting allocations for minimum operational budgets for
Nam Saat in a selected number of districts. Through working in partnership with PRF, the
Ministry of Health will be able to more cost-effectively deliver rural sanitations services in
the 44 districts where PRF is operating, some of the most remote and poor ones.
v.      Alignment of Water Global Practice technical assistance strategically with HGNDP
        Operation

To ensure optimal effectiveness of future TA, a geographic focus on the 12 districts in four
provinces of HGNDP’s community-interventions is recommended, directing assistance to
sanitation marketing and implementation support, and expanding behavioral focus of
sanitation BCC to so-called “baby-WASH” (child feces disposal, separation of children from
animal feces) for greater nutrition impacts.

vi.     Scaling-up and deepening the scope of collaboration between Nam Saat and PRF
        (under PRF3)8

Informed by an evaluation of the pilot partnership, a detailed scale-up strategy will be
developed, with a multi-pronged approach for horizontal scaling: i) expanding to a district-
wide approach in the 6 pilot districts, and ii) expansion of partnership in HGNDP districts.
Other development partners may also be brought on board, supporting the strategic
collaboration of Nam Saat with PRF in other districts. Depending on the outcomes of the
pilot, future TA could be used to test out potential financing mechanisms under PRF39 for
more poor-inclusive service delivery, such as a) the use of Self Help Groups or formal saving
and loan schemes that allow households to invest in sanitation; and b) the use of
infrastructure and/or livelihood grants for pro-poor support; upon prioritization of sanitation
by the community, the development of a village ODF-plan, such grants could be used to
transparently support eligible poor households.


vii.    Policy and programmatic assistance and advocacy for rural sanitation

High-level advocacy for resource mobilization would be the basis for the development of a
joint work program to addressing institutional weaknesses, for example in the areas of: i)
development of a pro-poor financing policy, ii) national monitoring for sanitation iii) human
resource development in partnership with the University of Health and Science.

  While not covered this report, additional Bank executed TA is also planned to help improve the sustainability
of rural water schemes under PRF3, through piloting a number of management and post construction support
models
9
  This is especially relevant since HGNDP does not provide any partial support or financing mechanism to poor
households
                                                      4
1. Introduction

1. This report synthesizes the activities, outputs and achievements of the following
complementary Technical Assistance, carried out by the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation
Program in support of strengthening rural sanitation service delivery by the Government of
Lao PDR:

        ‘Supporting Demand Creation for Sanitation through CLTS’ (P132453) and;
        ‘Sanitation Marketing in Lao PDR’ (P132249)

2. The TA program has been implemented over a multi-year period from November 2012
until March 2016, and has also benefited from dedicated policy and sector coordination
efforts10. The suite of TAs was developed in response to three challenges in the sanitation
sector in Lao PDR:

    The sanitation access agenda was far from being finished. Access to improved sanitation
     facilities in Lao PDR has increased considerably over recent years, from 28% in 2000 to
     71% in 2015, achieving the MDG target. In 2015, 94% of the urban population has access
     to an improved latrine, while only 56% of the rural population does11. Among the rural
     population, stark inequalities exist across regions and among ethnic and socio-economic
     groups. Only 13% of the poorest quintile has access to an improved toilet, while among
     the richest quintile this is 100%12. The SDG targets aim to reach universal access 2030.
    Lack of integrated program methodology addressed both demand for supply of affordable
     latrine. Prior to the TA program, rural water and sanitation projects in Lao PDR, as in
     many other countries, were characterized by a supply-led approach through hardware
     subsidies with little behavioral focus. The TA program builds on earlier lessons learnt
     from piloting CLTS and developing low-cost aspirational sanitation products for rural
     consumers that matched their preferences for durability13. Hence the TA was able to
     immediately work at scale within 10 districts in two provinces as well as at the national
     level.
    Poor sanitation was impacting on health and economic development of the country. Poor
     sanitation and hygiene caused at least three million disease episodes and 6,000 premature
     deaths annually while stunting rates among children in rural areas were very high at 49%
     in 2011. National economic losses due to poor sanitation totaled USD 193 million per
     year, equivalent to 5.6% of GDP.14


3. This report documents the results and lessons learned from the TA program that includes
experiences both from government-led rural sanitation service delivery within two provinces
in Southern Lao PDR (Champasak and Sekong) , as well as from national-level engagement
to strengthen systems, tools and capacity building approaches for scaling-up rural sanitation

   The budget for the combined TA (P132453 and P132368) for this period was USD 2,216,801 (including fixed
staff costs). A third TA “Supporting Sector Coordination for Scaling Up Rural Sanitation (P132249) has been
concluded in April 2015, which focused predominantly on sector coordination and policy support.

support of development partners – the effectiveness and scale of rural sanitation services can
be increased to achieve sustainable sanitation outcomes for the rural population of Lao PDR.
It also proposes recommendations for the engagement of the World Bank Water Practice in
the sector in support of rural sanitation service delivery, aligned with lending operations,
notably the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF3) and the Health Governance and Nutrition
Development Project (HGNDP).

4. The approach under this TA is based on the theory of change that connects strengthening
local supply chains with behavior change and demand creation for sanitation, while
improving the enabling environment to allow for a programmatic approach at-scale. WSP’s
global experience under its ‘Scaling Up Rural Sanitation Program’15 has been used to inform
and strengthen government-led and market-based delivery mechanisms under this TA. The
approach has built on earlier initiatives in the period 2011-2012 in Lao PDR, specifically for
Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS)16, as well as the development of affordable and
aspirational toilet products, based on rural consumer preferences17.

2. Country Context and Rationale
2.1. Country and Sector Context

Country background
5.      With a GDP per capita at USD 1,793.5 in 2014, Lao PDR is classified as a lower-
middle income economy. Albeit from a very low base, Lao PDR has achieved impressive
growth rates over the last two decades, averaging 6.9% per annum. During the decade
starting from 2005, with an average growth rate of 7.8% per annum, Lao PDR was the fastest
growing economy in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region, mostly driven by the natural
resource sector. However, Lao PDR’s growth has not been inclusive, and the gains for the
bottom 40% were significantly lower than for the rest of the population. In parallel, poverty
reduction was also less responsive to growth, and inequality widened over the decade. The
poverty rate fell from 46 percent in 1992/93 to 23.2 percent in 2012/13, leaving most of the
country’s poor in rural areas, where the depth and severity of poverty are much higher. Lao
PDR, with an estimated population of seven million, has seen rapid urbanization over the last
few years – in 2015, there were 4.3 million citizens (61%) living in rural areas and 1.8
million (39%) in urban areas.

6.      Natural resources - forestry, agricultural land, water, and minerals - comprise more
than half of Lao PDR’s total wealth and the country’s key development challenge will be to
ensure that this wealth is sustainably managed and transformed into investments in public
infrastructure and better health and educational outcomes, especially the poor. Lao PDR is
likely to meet the criteria for graduation from ‘Least Developed Country’ status by 2020,
which has been set forth as a vision in the recently approved 8th National Socio Economic
Development Plan (NSEDP) 2016-2020. Although good progress has been made on a
number of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a critical off-track MDG is nutrition,
with an estimated 44% of under-five children being stunted and 27% severely underweight in
2011. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will set a new framework against which
the government will monitor and evaluate its progress.

7.      As can be seen in Figure 2, Lao PDR has one of the highest levels of open defecation
in the region, with the exception of neighboring Cambodia. While urban access to improved
sanitation facilities in Lao PDR has increased from 66% in 2000 to 94% in 2015, rural
sanitation access is catching up and has increased from 17% to 56% in the same period18.
While a 2.6% annual increase in access in rural areas over the last decade is commendable,
stark inequalities remain across regions, wealth brackets and ethnicity. Residents of the
Southern region are much less likely than others to have access to improved facilities: 35%
have sanitation coverage, compared to 61% in the Northern region, and 68% in the Central
region.

8.       Figure 3 shows that in 2011, only 13% of the poorest quintile had access to an
improved toilet and 82% practiced open defecation, while among the richest quintile access
was 100%. Progress in the bottom 40% has been slow, increasing from 12% in 2000 to 35%
in 2011, while the top 60% has seen an increase from 33% to 89% in the same period19. In
households where the head of the household speaks Lao, 74% have access to improved
facilities, compared with 30% of those where the head speaks Khmou, 46% of those where
the head speaks Hmong, and 72% of those where the head speaks “other” languages20.

National targets and the persistent lack of domestic resources for rural sanitation
9.      While the National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) 2016-20 includes
national targets of 90% of the population using clean water and 80% using a latrine by 2020,
there is no specific national target for rural sanitation in the NSEDP. The National Action
Plan for Rural Water and Sanitation, issued by the Ministry of Health in 2012, promoted a
target that 60% of the rural population should have access to improved sanitation by 2015.
Based on the recent JMP assessment of 56%, this has been missed. During the 2014 High-
Level Meeting on Water and Sanitation, convened by the Sanitation and Water for All

(SWA) partnership21, the Minister of Health announced the goal to reduce open defecation to
35% in rural areas by 2016 (currently estimated at 37%) and increase access to sanitation in
rural areas to 70% by 2015 (estimated at 56%). This humbling situation means that the 2020
vision to graduate from Least Developed Country22 status as well as universal sanitation
targets under the Sustainable Development Goals23 will be stretching and will require an
acceleration from the ‘business as usual’ scenario.

10.     A recent World Bank Service Delivery Assessment for Water Supply and Sanitation24
concluded that to reach an interim target of 80% rural sanitation access by 2020, over
200,000 people would need to gain access annually. This is almost double the number of
rural households that gained access between 1995 and 2012. The assessment found that much
of the investment in domestic facilities has been initiated and funded by householders
themselves, especially as (until recently) most projects by government and development
agencies were short-term and tended to be fairly small scale25.

11.     Table 1 illustrates a minimum domestic budget indication required to achieve 80%
access in 2020, through 200,000 additional people every year gaining access. A total annual
minimum estimate of around USD 2.3-2.8 million will be needed, excluding administration
and salary costs at different government levels. This estimate assumes that no compensation
is given to village CLTS committees, and assumes that external technical assistance will be
made available to support the adoption of the sanitation marketing approach and other critical
areas where in-house government capacity needs further research and development, such as
M&E system development and BCC campaign development.

12.     The table below is based on the assumption that a government-led national program
will be implemented in the period 2017-2020, across 16 provinces, 100 districts and 4000
villages, aiming to exposure 80,000 households of 400,000 people annually26. The
assumption is that 200,000 people, or 40,000 households, or 50% of those living in targeted
villages, will be gaining access as a result of the rural sanitation program.

13.     Annually it is expected that 24,000 poor households, or 30% of all households living
in the 4000 villages, will be able to make use of a partial subsidy of USD 40 per household.
In addition, over a 4 year period, it is expected that 50% of villages will become ODF and
will receive a cash ODF-award of USD 500. The total four-year program budget would equal
USD 10.8 million, of which USD 3.8 million allocated for pro-poor subsidies, USD 1 million
for village level ODF-awards and 55 per cent for so-called ‘software’ costs. Assuming 0.8

all, and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable
situations”.

Finances into Services for the Future
25
   A 2009 Sanitation Financing study (Giltner., et. al.) estimated that better-off households are willing to pay for
good quality toilets. Household financing has been driving coverage increase, although slowly, as only 18% of
household latrine construction in 2008/09 was subsidized, with the vast majority funded from households’ own
resources.
26
   The district wide approach is based on realistic expectation that existing human resources can implement rural
sanitation in 10 villages per district per year, hence covering 40 villages in the district in the planning period
2017-2020. This national program is assumed to be present in all 16 provinces (excluding Vientiane), and two-
thirds of all districts, and half of all Lao PODR’s 8000 village sin the first planning period.

(including subsidies/incentives). Based on the above assumptions, at least 64,000 households
will self-invest over the program period, leveraging an amount of over USD 6 million
directly from households27.

14.    As households will continue to be the predominant source of capital financing for
rural toilets, perhaps with the exception of targeted partial subsidies for the poorest
households, a drastic scale-up of government financial and human resources is required, as
27
   Assuming USD 100 per toilet (excluding shelter)
28
   At this moment, an impact evaluation is being conducted that is testing the effectiveness of a modest partial
poor subsidy of USD 20 on the uptake of sanitation by poor households. It is expected that higher subsidies will
lead to higher uptake, assuming that demand creation is well executed and the rules of the game for subsidy
eligibility are clear. Hence a higher value of USD 40 is used in the budget (price without transport and shelter is
around USD 80). The impact evaluation also tests whether a village level cash incentive will lead to faster
achievement of ODF or higher sanitation uptake rates, or whether such incentives are not necessary to motivate
communities.

compared to the minimum allocations now provided. Government-led demand creation for
sanitation and capacity building will be critical to enable and motivate households to make
such investments in their own sanitation facilities.

15.     Current domestic government resources for so-called “soft” program spending, such
as for rural sanitation promotion, CLTS, behavior change communications, capacity building
and important functions such as monitoring are virtually negligible, and mostly reliant on
financial support of development partners and NGOs. This is partly due to absence of a
dedicated budget line for rural sanitation program spending in the overall budget plan of the
Ministry of Health29. Announcements made during the SWA meeting in 2014 in support of
increased budget allocation and the set-up of a dedicated budget line have thus far not yet
materialized.
16.     Box 1 lists the SWA commitments, with progress made thus far on the development
of an overarching WASH policy (in development and slated for approval by May 2016) , and
on the first Joint Annual Sector Review (conducted in May 2015), while other commitments
remain underfunded.

17.     The extremely resource constrained environment means that the National Centre for
Environmental Health and Water Supply (Nam Saat), under the Ministry of Health, mandated
for rural sanitation, has targets to meet, but almost no resources for meeting them.

Level Meeting


     Announcements made by Minister of Health:

        1.   The Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) in
             collaboration with Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) will develop an
             overarching policy on WASH for both urban and rural areas by 2016
        2.   The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Public Work and Transport to continue to strengthen
             WASH Sector coordination and to take the lead on organizing Annual Joint Sector Review (Urban
             and Rural) and tracking agreed Sector indicators in close collaboration with all WASH
             stakeholders.
        3.   By 2016, access to sustainable, equitable and safe water supply to 70% in rural communities
             including schools and health centers
        4.   By 2016, open defecation will be reduced to 35% in rural areas including schools and health centers
             through Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and sanitation marketing promotion to contribute
             to reduce the rate of malnutrition
        5.   The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and Investment will increase the annual
             budget allocation to 30% for rural WASH including creating separate budget line in national budget
             for rural WASH
        6.   The MOH and MPWT will strengthen their institutional capacity of both urban and rural WASH
             agencies (Nam Saat and Nam Papa) to deliver sustainable WASH services by 2016.

  Rural sanitation program spending hence is often “hidden” under general headings such as supervision and
monitoring as part of Nam Saat rural water and sanitation budgets, that tend to be reserved for hardware
investments (new rural water schemes, rehabilitation of wells, etc.). This leaves the only resources available to
be the basic salaries of Nam Saat staff, with limited operational budget to carry out rural sanitation promotion.

2.2 Rationale for investing in rural sanitation
18.    The Government of Lao PDR has made important steps in recognizing the vital role
of water, sanitation and hygiene for addressing the burden of disease and persistent
undernutrition in the country30. Poor sanitation and hygiene causes at least three million
disease episodes and 6,000 premature deaths in Lao PDR every year. Diarrheal disease is tied
with pneumonia as the second largest killer of children under five. In Lao PDR, 44% of
children under five years of age (around 417,000 children) are stunted (low height for age),
27% are underweight and 6% are wasted (low weight for height)31.

19.      The recently approved National Nutrition Strategy to 2025 and Plan of Action 2016-
2020 (Jan 2016) includes sanitation and hygiene under its priority interventions. Research
has indicated that when any members of a community practice open defecation, there are
negative implications for the health of all community members. The relationship between
open defecation and stunting in rural communities of Lao PDR is shown in Figure 4. As the
percentage of community members who practice open defecation and/or use unimproved
latrines moves from 0% to 100%, children are on average shorter. Children grow shorter even
when less than 50% of all community members practice open defecation or use unimproved
facilities. Once a child’s height becomes shorter than average, it remains shorter than average
at every age and even falls below the critical measure of stunting (Z score of -2).

                                         age in months
          Community level open defecation and unimproved sanitation = 0%
          Community level open defecation and unimproved sanitation between 0% and 50%
          Community level open defecation and unimproved sanitation between 50% and 99%
          Community level open defecation and unimproved sanitation = 100%


20.    The research also revealed that – controlling for other relevant variables - children
living in rural villages where community members defecate in the open and/or use
unimproved latrines are 1.1 cm shorter than healthy children living in rural villages where
everybody uses improved sanitation. This small difference in height is irreversible, and
matters a great deal for a child’s cognitive development and future productive potential.

Universal usage of improved sanitation is needed to adequately address stunting. Therefore
future policy, targets and incentives need to be aligned to promote community-wide behavior
change, going beyond individual household interventions.


2.3 Rationale for the TA program and partnerships
21.     Prior to the start of the World Bank’s TA program, a number of government and
donor-assisted projects were implemented which promoted latrine use and basic hygiene in
rural areas. They tended to promote relatively expensive toilet designs, and relied heavily on
providing direct and often full subsidies for toilets. These projects, though patchy in nature,
largely failed to stimulate real demand for toilets, and therefore had limited impact on the
level of latrine use nationally32.

22.      Through intense consultation with the Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion
(DHHP) and Nam Saat, as well as with strategic development partners and NGOs active in
the rural sanitation space, a comprehensive TA program was initiated. The program focused
on policy development and sector coordination, as well as on the development of a new
programmatic approach for rural sanitation service delivery. This programmatic approach
aimed to stimulate collective behavior change at the village level to stop open defecation,
while ensuring that once the demand is generated, rural households are able to easily access
and afford toilet options that meet their aspirations and preferences through local suppliers.
Unlike previous small-scale projects in few scattered villages, such a programmatic approach
would be strongly anchored with the mandated government institutions and implemented at
district level. This would allow scale-up and replication through a national rural sanitation
program, assuming that human and financial resources would gradually become available
over time, with the prioritization of the rural sanitation agenda. Hence, the TA aimed to
develop nationally applicable guidelines, tools, materials and capacity building packages that
could be scaled up through government with development partner support.

23.     Partnerships with UNICEF, SNV and Plan international were sought in the joint
development process of such programmatic approach. The joint development of national
guidelines and toolkits would avoid fragmentation and ensure a more efficient use of scarce
resources (often persistent in sectors where most resources are channeled off-budget through
multiple NGOs). It is important to note that by 2012, as a result of sector consensus building,
these agencies had stopped the use of upfront full hardware subsidies (i.e. a supply-led
approach) and were focusing on behavior change and demand generation for improved
latrines through the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach.


3. Technical Assistance objectives and summary results


Project Development Objective
24.     The overall development objective of the TA was to increase improved sanitation and
hygiene practices and change community behavior to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF)
status at the village level, through:
         supporting the government in developing sustainable and scalable models for
            demand creation in rural areas through CLTS, (for P132245),


32
     See sanitation financing study (Giltner. et al., 2012)
                                                              14
           strengthening the supply chain for affordable and aspirational sanitation products
            and services (P132368),
           developing and supporting local implementation of evidence-based behavior
            change strategies (P132368).

25.     A comprehensive TA program was implemented from November 2012 to March 2016
with the aim of laying the groundwork for a national program to scale up rural sanitation and
hygiene promotion33. This was to be done by a combination of both provincial level support
to implement a new service delivery approach at meaningful scale, combined with national
level system strengthening. The provinces of Champasak and Sekong in the south functioned
as a ‘learning laboratory’ and provincial authorities received support to implement
Community-led Total Sanitation (CLTS)34 combined with sanitation marketing. This
implementation experience was then used to consolidate lessons learned, develop guidance
documents and capacity building manuals and toolkits that would help scale up nation-wide
implementation with the support of other development partners. The Ministry of Health
(MoH) specifically the Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion (DHHP), and the
National Center for Environmental Health and Water Supply (or ‘Nam Saat’) under this
department are the nodal agencies responsible for rural sanitation. These agencies, including
their provincial and district units, were thus the principal audience of the TA.

Table 2 provides a summary overview of the achievements as compared to the intended
intermediate outcomes and indicators set out in the project concept notes.




33
   The budget for the combined TA (P132453 and P132368) for this period was USD 2,216,801 (including fixed
staff costs). A third TA “Supporting Sector Coordination for Scaling Up Rural Sanitation (P132249) has been
concluded in April 2015, which focused predominantly on sector coordination and policy support.
34
  Community-Led Total Sanitation is a facilitated community empowerment process that motivates community
members to collectively stop open defecation and start building and using improved latrines with the aim of
reaching and sustaining Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. See also www.communityledtotalsanitation.org

4. Implementation process, challenges and results

26.      The TA program was designed and managed by the Water and Sanitation Program,
while partnerships were sought through contracted resource agencies to support government-
led implementation, undertake capacity building for clients, and to facilitate joint learning
and problem solving with respect to the new programmatic approach being introduced. The
resource agencies for supporting CLTS capacity building were SNV (Netherlands
Development Organization) and PADETC (a not-for-profit Lao organization). For sanitation
marketing, Population Services International (PSI), an INGO36, was contracted and led the
capacity development of the private sector and supported government to take on new roles
with respect to market facilitation for sanitation. An upfront overview of the activities is
illustrated in

28.     Challenges for rural sanitation provision in Lao PDR are well documented37, and
pertain to the persistent inadequate budget allocations for a nation-wide rural sanitation
program, limited human resources and capacities available especially at district level,
virtually non-existent sector monitoring, and a lack of harmonized approaches that emphasize


36
  Firm contracts were also concluded for the execution of the nation-wide formative research for supply and
consumer research, as well as for the development of the BCC campaign, under close guidance and supervision
by WSP.

demand creation, behavior change communications and which facilitate the involvement of
the local private sector for the supply of affordable and aspirational toilets.

4.1 Demand creation through Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS)

4.1.1 Implementation process and challenges

29.     Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is an approach used to create demand for
sanitation. Using emotional drivers such as disgust, shame (or other locally suited
motivators), external facilitators empower the community to collectively stop open defecation
and start to build and use toilets. Often, village regulations are used as a way to help support
this change. The event by which this community awakening takes place is referred to as
“triggering”38.

30.    Interventions were focused in seven districts in Champasak province (out of 10) and
three districts in Sekong province (out of four), and were identical to areas where
complimentary sanitation marketing activities were to take place under government
leadership, with support from a resource agency specialized in social marketing. The
completion report for the CLTS technical assistance is available upon request as supporting
documentation.

Planning for scale
31.    Provincial health departments and provincial Nam Saat offices in Champasak and
Sekong provinces, as well as the district health office and Nam Saat offices are the modal
agencies for rural sanitation. Broader CLTS committees were set-up in every target province
and district, with members drawn from Health and Nam Saat office, Cooperation and
Investment Planning, Education office, Rural Development office, Administration office,
Lao’s Women Union and Youth Union.

32.     The TA intended to reach a stretch target of 400 villages across 10 districts in two
years (2014-2015) encouraging provinces and district leaders to start thinking of
implementation at a district-wide scale. The 15 villages per district would be covered in the
first year (2014) and 25 in the second year (2015), with decreasing technical assistance
support in the second year, requiring all operational costs for the CLTS process to be
financed through the provincial and district Nam Saat budget. Setting an ambitious target was
important in order to learn what level of scale could realistically be achieved in a resource
constrained environment, both in terms of human resources to implement the work, and in
terms of the operational budgets available at district level to do so.

33.     As resource constraints became apparent, especially due to late and lower than
expected allocations to the districts, not all 400 villages could be covered in the period. The
plan was revised to cover calendar year 2016 aiming to reach a reduced number of 310
villages39. Hence, implementation followed the following phasing:

      i.   40 villages (already implemented in 2012-2013)
     ii.   184 villages (over 2014 and 2015)

38
   Typical activities during a triggering event include village open defecation mapping, shit calculation, and the
infamous “walk of shame” to frequently places where people go for open defecation.
39
   The impact evaluation – first phase - focused on 150 villages across 10 districts, while the second phase
requires at least 160 villages (excludes the 40 villages in 2012/2013)

                                                        19
     iii.   126 villages (over 2016)40

34.      The district wide approach, a globally recognized best-practice for sanitation, is
specifically relevant for Lao PDR as previous CLTS interventions typically took place in just
a few villages in a single district with intense hand-holding support. A sequence of different
activities for implementing rural sanitation at scale through the district wide approach is
illustrated in annex E.

Focus of the CLTS technical assistance
35.   The CLTS technical assistance covered three interrelated components:

   i.       Development of management capacity, planning and monitoring at provincial level
  ii.       Capacity building for implementation of demand creation through CLTS at all levels
 iii.       Development of a scalable capacity-building package for the national level

36.    Program coordination structures (CLTS committees) were established at provincial
and district levels, with the Nam Saat office as the central point of the coordination system.
CLTS Committees were also set-up at the village level. The development of simple budget
and planning tools was instrumental to support Nam Saat to secure at least a minimum
amount of resources, although often budget requests were not fully honored.

37.     A team of 25 national CLTS trainers (master trainers) from Nam Saat central and
provinces was established, trained and are now available to deliver Training of Trainers
across the country. The master trainers cascaded their new knowledge and skills to other Nam
Saat staff at the provincial and district level. A total of 469 provincial and district level
officials have been trained in CLTS related topics. Training sufficient staff at district level
proved to be a challenge, as in some cases, there is only one Nam Saat district staff member
for 50 villages. Therefore, in some districts, CLTS teams included staff and cadres from the
Lao Women Union, and other units under the Health office.

38.     CLTS related training covered a range of topics and field-practice, including pre-
triggering, triggering, post-triggering, verification and ODF declaration. Other topics
included: facilitation and community mobilization, latrine technical construction, informed
choice product catalogue, education sessions on handwashing with soap, and the use of
monitoring tools/forms. The experiences of applying a simple monitoring system were shared
nationally to inform a future institutionalized rural sanitation monitoring system41.

39.    In addition, roadshows were organized to raise awareness of higher-level leaders, who
were not CLTS team members but whose support would be critical for implementation.
These advocacy roadshows discussed the status of sanitation and its impact on development
in Lao PDR and built essential support for the CLTS approach amongst stakeholders external
to Nam Saat, including provincial vice governors and district chiefs. Ownership of provincial
and district administrators was critical because of budgetary control, and because of their role



40
   Implementation of CLTS is currently ongoing for these 126 villages, with financial support of East Meets
West Foundation
41
   At every level increasing level of aggregation of results took place, with village level using three forms,
district level four forms and at provincial level five forms. The TA did not have resources to help institutionalize
a national MIS for rural sanitation (or integrate this into existing health sector MIS)

                                                        20
in mobilizing support and motivating communities and village leaders around sanitation and
ODF targets42.


Development of national CLTS package
40.     Following the operational guidelines for rural sanitation, issued in April 2014 by Nam
Saat, a national CLTS toolkit was developed for standardizing replication. This is relevant as
by 2015 there are over 10 local and international NGOs supporting the government in rolling
out CLTS across 31 districts in 10 provinces. Nam Saat Central team lead the revision of an
already existing CLTS package and improved this based on consultation with World Bank,
SNV, PADETC, UNICEF, Plan International and World Vision.

41.     The final package was then presented at a national learning event before finalization
in September 201543. The sector-wide adoption of CLTS needs to be appreciated against a
backdrop of previously supply-driven hardware approaches, with little behavioral focus and
attention for bottom-up community mobilization. Advocacy videos on CLTS were also
developed to        further raise awareness         on    the approach       (available at
http://youtu.be/n7ljD6Gw1lY). Figure 6 illustrates the scale-up of the CLTS approach as of
2013. As part of the national nutrition mapping under MoH leadership with EU/UNICEF
support, in which CLTS is one of the priority interventions, an updated map will be available
by mid-2016, which will be updated annually.




42
   This is consistent with findings from the consumer research about behavioral drivers for households to invest
in sanitation. Being seen to comply with government rules and instructions featured as a motivator especially for
males.
43
   The event was chaired by the Vice-Minister of Health and attended by senior officials including Provincial
Governors and Provincial Heads of Health Offices. In total 10 provincial delegations attended the event.

4.1.2 Sharing lessons and fostering replication at national scale

Knowledge exchange and the development of CLTS curriculum for new health
staff
42.     Several visits from other provinces (supported by development partners) took place to
Champasak and Sekong province to learn from the sanitation program, including how
linkages with the market-based approaches have been combined (see also section 4.2).
Knowledge exchange to Indonesia in 2014 were organized (see annex C for participant list).
The Indonesia visit was a particularly good occasion to observe an at-scale program led by
local governments, using a district-wide approach, and featured a wide engagement of the
entire health system at various levels (village cadre, health center staff and district health
office). The experience of Indonesia in institutionalizing a national pre- and in-service
training program, including on-line learning, within national health schools sparked particular
interest44. This motivated Lao officials to pursue a similar approach.
43.     Box 2 provides further detailed on the curriculum that has been developed thus far
and that will be taught to future health staff within Lao PDR.

Box 2 Overview of mainstreaming CLTS in the national health university curriculum

 The National University for Health and Science in Vientiane is currently revising a curriculum for an
 Associate Degree for the Public Health Program. In close collaboration between the University and Nam
 Saat, the new revised curriculum will include a subject on rural sanitation, with an emphasis on the CLTS
 approach, as part of the Associate Degree in the Public Health program. The CLTS modules were developed
 based on international and local experience acquired by Nam Saat over the past few years. The associate
 degree takes three years to complete, slightly less than for a bachelor degree, for students who graduated from
 high school and for in-service government staff who graduated from a college for nurses/heath workers.

 On average, every year, 45 students enroll in the Public Health program, with most of them subsequently
 finding jobs as health workers at the provincial and district level. Existing health Centre staff are encouraged
 to enroll in this program to upgrade and update their knowledge and skills.

 The curriculum on CLTS is spread out over three modules, with a total teaching time of 46 hours. The
 curriculum also includes a field-based practice of 80 hours. It is expected that in the 2017/2018 academic
 year, the curriculum will be taught for the first time by the Nursing Faculty at the University of Health and
 Science in Vientiane capital, ensuring that sufficient number of lecturers have been trained and exposed to
 CLTS activities beforehand.

 The curriculum will be enhanced as soon as BCC materials and toolkits have become available, in order to
 expand the demand creation skills of students. The development of the above curriculum was informed by a
 wider capacity needs assessment and a capacity building framework developed under this TA, which is also
 available as supporting documentation.



Scaling up CLTS approach through partnership with PRF
44.      Although the scale-up (see Figure 6) is remarkable, challenges with funding as well as
with human resources for CLTS implementation remain a huge bottleneck, especially in the
context of remote rural districts. With long travelling distances from district to village level,
dispersed and numerous villages per district (around 80), and with only around 1-2 Nam Saat
staff at district level, the tasks becomes daunting (see annex C). Therefore, WSP initiated a
dialogue with the WB-funded Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) to explore avenues to leverage
PRF’s Kumban Facilitators (KBF) and Village Implementation Teams (VITs) as a platform
for supporting service delivery (see Box 3).


Box 3 Information and rationale for partnership with Poverty Reduction Fund as service
delivery structure

 The Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF), under the supervision of the National Committee for Rural Development
 and Poverty Reduction, is mandated to help the government to implement its policy to reduce rural poverty in
 line with the 8th NSEDP. It operates in 44 poor districts in 10 provinces, implementing bottom-up planning
 processes and providing communities with block grants to implement priority infrastructure subprojects. The
 PRF has also started to improve the livelihood and nutrition status of villagers on a pilot basis. The PRF has
 trained many village level leaders, including Kumban Facilitators (KBF) and the Village Implementation
 Team (VIT). There are three KBF in every kumban where the PRF operates, and 44% of them are women.
 The VIT consists of village leaders selected by villagers to implement infrastructure subprojects. The PRF
 provides them with repeated training in leadership, community facilitation and bottom-up processes. The
 village level institutions and kumban human resources that the PRF has developed are considered to be a
 useful platform through which multiple agencies can deliver last mile services at a lower cost, while clearly
 keeping the institutional mandate with such line agencies, in the case of sanitation, with Nam Saat/MoH. At
 the same time, such cooperation supports the aim of poverty reduction by the PRF.
                                                      23
45.      Following exposure visits by PRF representatives / leadership to CLTS villages, and
after a cost-analysis showed that at-scale service delivery using PRF platform would lead to
40% efficiency gains, a pilot partnership was agreed for the period Oct 2015-Sept 2016. The
pilot partnership will be implemented in 40 villages, in 27 village clusters (kumbans), and six
districts within four of the PRF’s target provinces, with TA being provided to Nam Saat and
PRF-staff. A detailed Standard Operating Procedure was developed that would allow PRF
and kumban facilitators to carry out the CLTS process, without the need to integrate this in
the same time-frame as the Community-Driven Development cycle in any particular village45.

46.      A cooperation agreement between PRF and Nam Saat was signed and is being
revisited (see annex D). Thus far a total of 122 PRF and Nam Saat district staff and kumban
facilitators have been trained through the TA. By end of February 2016, 28 villages have
been triggered, with over 1,511 households participating, an initial expression of interest to
build toilets amongst 27% of the villagers, and the start of latrine construction activities in 28
villages. The pilot will be evaluated by October 2016 and lessons learnt will inform the
further deepening of the scale-up under PRF3. As part of the WB-funded Health Governance
and Nutrition Development project (HGNDP), CLTS will be implemented across 876
villages in 12 districts of 4 provinces in the period 2016-2021, combined with nutrition BCC
interventions.

4.2 Sanitation marketing approach

4.2.1 Implementation process and challenges

47.      Sanitation marketing is an approach that aims to increase access to sanitation by
applying commercial marketing techniques to stimulate demand and to strengthen private
sector capacity to deliver affordable, safe, aspirational and durable latrines to rural, lower-
income populations. The approach focuses on strengthening the role of the local private
sector in service delivery, who most of the households would turn to for purchasing and
installing their toilets. The marketing approach views households as consumers, recognizing
their individual preferences rather than homogeneous beneficiaries for whom standardized
“toilets” (or toilet parts, often unused) are being procured through government or “project”
procurement channels. This sets sanitation marketing apart from conventional supply-led
approaches to sanitation service provision46.

48.    In 2011-2012 the World Bank, in collaboration with iDE, an iNGO, supported a
“proof-of-concept” pilot in two districts of Champasak and Sekong to use consumer-driven
design to develop affordable and marketable sanitation. In close collaboration with provincial
government and local businesses, an aspirational product line of three toilet options was
developed and tested, and business models were developed, including packaging of product
and services. The pilot examined future directions for sales, social marketing and distribution
45
  Within PRF districts, not every village will have the opportunity to benefit every year from a community
grant (infrastructure or livelihood grant), thus kumban facilitators and village implementation teams can support
a CLTS process, even in a year where the concerning village would not be eligible for a grant in the CDD cycle.
46
   Such traditional approaches typically supply latrines to a selected number of households through project-procurement
chains, which often cannot be easily accessed by household themselves. Limited funds for full-subsidy approaches put limits
to the scalability of these interventions. If delivered without adequate behavior change or demand creation, project supply of
latrines could put the sustainable use at risk. Scaling-up rural sanitation will require sanitation market development, delivery
of effective behavior change communication, as well as a strong enabling environment with a focus on equity. For more
information refer to “What Does it Take to Scale up Rural Sanitation? (Perez, et al., 2012)

                                                              24
strategies. The initial product line consisted of two types of pour-flush toilets (one basic and
one higher-end version), as well as an aspirational waterless-toilet.

49.    This TA, through engaging PSI as a resource agency, sought to scale up the approach
in 10 districts in order to find best practices for implementing sanitation marketing in rural
Lao PDR. The completion report of the sanitation marketing assistance is available as
supporting documentation. The scale-up consisted of three interlinked components:

  i.    Strengthening the capacity of the private sector through new business models
 ii.    Strengthening ownership of government and its ability to facilitate sanitation
        marketing
 iii.   Developing models and partnerships to increase financing options for household
        sanitation


Capacity building business and sales agents and the One-Stop-Shop business
model
50.      This component involved “recruiting” interested enterprises and training them in
latrine manufacturing and business skills, as well as training sales agents to conduct door-to-
door sales. Over the life of the project, 12 enterprises were recruited and trained in 10
districts. Not all businesses would fit the criteria that were developed based on best practices
in other countries in the region. Network standards were used in order to ensure that
enterprises would have a certain level of basic commercial and technical capacity, motivation
and working capital to allow responding to demand created.

51.     Business skills training was provided in order to give participants further knowledge,
skills and confidence to conduct daily business operations. Latrine manufacturing training
was also provided, ensuring a high-quality product. Despite the training provided – including
refresher training enterprises (three) were dropped from the network due to issues such as low
quality latrine production, or inability to meet capital or labor requirements, and new
enterprises (four) were recruited. Some districts (Lamarm and Dakcheung in Sekong) proved
challenging, due to a lack of suitable enterprises present in the district, coupled with other
barriers for marketing such as poor road accessibility. Eventually, businesses were identified
in these districts but were not included in the network to maintain quality standards
(nevertheless some basic training was provided to them).

52.     Based on rapid market assessments and early implementation lessons, it was decided
not to include the waterless toilet in the product range, as consumer demand for dry solutions
was low, and a strong preference was found for pour-flush latrines due to benefits of no-smell
and easiness to clean.
53.     Figure 7 illustrates the product options that sanitation enterprises in the network are
offering, with price levels varying from LAK 500,000 (USD 60) to LAK 650,000 (USD 78),
excluding transport. These price levels do not include the superstructure or shelter, which
households were advised to make from natural materials, while saving to upgrade to more
durable structures.

54.      A ‘one-stop-shop’ model was introduced to make the process of acquiring a latrine
easier. Previously, consumers who wanted to buy a latrine were discouraged because they
were forced to visit multiple vendors to acquire the different components needed, and had to
organize their own installation and transport services. Under the ‘one-stop-shop’ model,
households only have to visit a single vendor, and depending on preference could use
transport and installations services or self-install. The streamlining of the supply chain is
illustrated in

58.     In total, 102 sales agents were recruited and trained during the TA. Several
recruitment strategies were employed, the most successful of which was gathering
recommendations for suitable candidates from village chiefs within the high priority zones of
each district. Sales agents attended an initial five-day training, and were closely supervised
during their first three months, enabling them to conduct direct sales for groups and
individuals, deal with objections from consumers, and fill out order forms. Initially, sales
agents were managed by the resource agency’s provincial coordinators in order to give
entrepreneurs time to improve their business and management and skills.

59.     Management of sales agents was transferred to enterprises at the end of the project.
Although all latrine sales through the enterprises at the end of the TA were made through
their sales agents, the management coordination of sales agents remains a difficult task for
businesses to handle, especially given the high turnover and difficulties to maintain
motivation among the sales force. This is illustrated by the fact that by end of December
2015, only 10% of the total sales agents trained remained active47. Challenges encountered in
developing the network of enterprises and sales agents are further elaborated in Box 4.




47
  The sales industry typically has a high turnover rate of 30% annually, however a combination of the
challenging conditions and learning by doing (in terms of sales agent recruitment strategy) explain the very high
turnover during the two-year TA period.

Box 4 The challenges of selling sanitation in rural areas



 Sustaining an active sales force: recruitment, motivation and management

 Sales agent recruitment and retention proved to be one of the most challenging tasks. Agents must meet
 certain criteria and be willing to meet the (considerable) challenges of the job. Initially, village health staff
 were recruited as sales agents, a practice quite common in other countries. However, despite the fact that
 sanitation marketing produces a public health benefit, some key stakeholders felt that there was a conflict of
 interest if public sector cadres, including village chiefs, would be working on commission for the private
 sector, and the approach was stopped. Instead, sales agents were recruited from other groups such as students.
 Although they were good in sales, their time commitment and inability to cover remote target districts posed
 a challenge to sustain this strategy. A final iteration of the recruitment strategy was to identify sales agents in
 villages where CLTS triggering had taken place, based on recommendations from village chiefs (this
 included the use of so-called village Latrine Champions, who already bought a latrine). This strategy,
 although having the downside of creating a larger group of village-based sales agents that need continuous
 coaching and supervision, thus far seems the most appropriate. It circumvented the perceived conflict of
 interest of formal village chiefs, while village-based sales agents would still be able to cover other
 “volunteering” roles within their communities (for which occasionally a small compensation would be paid).

 Once recruited, continuing to motivate sales agents was difficult. Motivation levels were particularly low
 during the rainy season, when travel was difficult, and during the harvesting season, when villagers were
 usually working on their farms and were therefore unable to attend sales events. Agents earned money on a
 commission-only basis, and not every sales pitch they gave ended in a sale, so many of them gave up.

 For one enterprise, sales agents were given a minimum guaranteed salary (of around LAK 400,000 or USD
 50/month) from the enterprise, with the opportunity to improve this through commission. However, this
 arrangement was not feasible for small companies, who found it hard to bear the salary costs if sales could
 not be maintained at a consistent level. Instead, for some enterprises, commissions were structured in a way
 that a small deposit upon ordering could be retained by the sales agents, even in the case of order
 cancellation. Such order cancellations happened for reasons that households were not able to either prepare
 the cash upon delivery, failed to dig the pit, or due to free latrine distribution in some areas, immediately
 dampening demand and creating expectations among villagers. Out of 2239 orders, only 1465 materialized in
 sales (65%).

 The use of close supervision and motivation tools and strategies made sales agents more effective but did not
 necessarily reduce turnover. Thus, continuous recruitment and coaching will be a requirement, and – based
 on experiences in other countries - this may prove challenging for a majority of businesses, whose core
 capacity lies in construction. Hence, bundling the management role of a sales force, for example a social
 franchise or business associations, may be a solution in the medium term, or continued external support by
 NGOs may be needed.




Strengthening government’s ability to facilitate sanitation marketing
60.     The broader goal of the TA was to help delineate institutional arrangements and
functions for sanitation marketing, understand government capacity for market facilitation
and provide information to all stakeholders on market-based approaches to sanitation. This
starts with recognizing the government’s role in private sector development for sanitation as
being supportive as opposed to implemental. In this role, government partners can ensure that
barriers to market remain low, competition is encouraged and that price controls and other
detrimental interventions - such as untargeted, direct subsidies through public or “project”

                                                        28
procurement – are avoided. This would help to create a market environment that allows
consumers to have a choice in a variety of affordable, high quality products. The
Government’s role in rural sanitation, primarily taken on by Nam Saat, was thus articulated
as follows:

        Manage regulations on latrine installation to ensure environmental health and safety
         standards are met and that private sector is aware of such standards
        Ensure transparency and adequate information provision to all private sector players
        Ensure alignment of all sanitation activities with national strategies and policies, such
         as the harmonization of targeted pro-poor support mechanisms
        Implement nationwide BCC campaigns to encourage uptake of latrine and
         implementation of CLTS activities at the village level
        Facilitate linking of private sector players with CLTS activities 48, legitimizing
         market-based approaches, and helping enterprises to identify high priority areas based
         on CLTS plans
        Potentially deliver targeted, partial subsidies aimed at reaching the very poor (e.g.
         vouchers) and inform and coordinate such schemes with private enterprises49

61.     During the TA, frequent communication with Nam Saat at provincial and district level
was required. Expectations and understanding of the supportive role of government for
market-based approaches needed to be clarified, and the benefits of such partnerships with
the private sector needed to be articulated.

62.     Due to low capacities, limited resources and a lack of experience with training and
coaching enterprises and sales agents, these roles – in the context of Lao PDR and many
other countries– are not well suited to be taken on by government as direct implementers.
Other mechanisms to provide such services at-scale would be more suitable, such as social
franchise models, business associations, or potentially government-run small and medium
enterprise development or vocational training programs (see section below).

Models and partnerships to increase financing options for household sanitation
63.    The range of pour-flush sanitation products brought to market, costs in the range of
LAK 500,000 (USD 60) to LAK 650,000 (USD 78). However, that is still a significant sum
for many rural families to pay in cash upon delivery, hence the need to evaluate financing
options available to them.

64.     The TA program carried out a review of potential financial institutions and consumers
to understand: i) Micro Finance Institution (MFI) strategies with regard to pro-poor financial
products and level of penetration in rural areas, ii) MFI motivation to include sanitation
financing under consumptive loan products, and iii) household preferences for sanitation loan
financing. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find a suitable partner institution that was
financially stable, socially oriented, with a geographic coverage in the 10 districts, had
reasonably aligned operations and policies, and the potential ability to scale up and serve
larger geographic areas.


48
   This means that government staff would not take up sales agents roles, but that village sanitation committees
and village-based sales agents know where and how to contact suppliers
49
   An impact evaluation using output-based subsidies for poor households is currently being implemented in
partnership with Nam Saat, East Meets West Foundation and WSP.

                                                      29
65.     However, one financing model was piloted in conjunction with village banks in
Soukhoumma District, under the GiZ Access to Finance for the Poor program50. The pilot
was designed to understand the willingness of consumers to borrow and the capacity of
village banks to meet demand for sanitation loans. To date, only five loans were used for
sanitation, which formed part of larger home improvement loans issued by the village banks
to consumers (not dedicated sanitation loans). A consumer survey in Soukhoumma district
(n=66) revealed that 50% of households said they did not need a loan, while the other half
stated they did not qualify for a loan, most likely due to the restrictions of households to have
more than one outstanding loan with a village bank at any given time. At the same time, two-
thirds stated they were not interested to use a loan for sanitation. These results are consistent
with the national consumer research findings51, which indicate that households are more
likely to save for such investments or borrow money from family members52.

66.     Other available financing options may be explored under the Poverty Reduction Fund,
which has established and capitalized ‘self-help groups’ with seed money. These groups are
currently being evaluated and may undergo further changes for PRF3. Opportunities exist to
introduce saving schemes for sanitation through these groups53.


4.2.2 Sharing lessons and fostering replication at-scale

Combining sanitation marketing with CLTS
67.     In order to institutionalize market-based approaches, the following lessons on how to
best link sanitation marketing with CLTS activities were learned during implementation and
articulated during learning events.

        Timeliness: after district staff are trained in CLTS, implementation of triggering and
         follow-up can start quite rapidly. However, the time it takes to prepare a district for
         the implementation of a sanitation marketing approach is much longer (1-2 months at
         a minimum). Suitable enterprises have to be identified, motivated, trained and
         coached on a one-on-one basis so that they can provide high quality latrines,
         understand and adapt the business model and develop a sales force. Therefore,
         preferably, supply chain facilitation efforts need to start ahead (or at least at the same
         time) as a demand creation program.
        Maintain quality: CLTS programs mobilize entire communities and villages
         throughout kumbans and districts, and hence positive word of mouth communication
         is vital to create and maintain trust in sanitation products. Government “endorsement”
         of enterprises and their products is vital and could be taken to the next level through a
         formal accreditation or quality assurance scheme.
        Coordination across district boundaries. In some districts enterprises that were able
         to produce high-quality, durable sanitation products could not be found. Hence

50
   These village banks were to form part of a still-to-be established micro-finance institution, that would be
formally registered with support of GiZ technical assistance
51

marketing Communications for Lao PDR: Final Report”
52
   While some households expressed interest in installment payments, care has to be taken in advising small
businesses to adopt such schemes, due to their weak working capital and difficult to manage the collection
process. In Mounlapamuk district, the scheme was successfully tested, especially when village authorities were
used to collect money for due installments.
53
   Or perhaps in some provinces through more mature village banks or MFIs (Sekong and Champasak did not
have such mature village banks yet)

                                                     30
         coordination between district and provincial staff is important to arrange for supply
         chain linkages beyond district boundaries. Additional effort is needed to motivate
         businesses in neighboring districts to deliver to remoter areas (which tend to decrease
         the profit margin on their products). In such remote situations, a form of grant support
         for transport costs may be desirable.
        Limitations of market-based approach: Sales agents and businesses were informed in
         which villages CLTS would happen and encouraged to conduct sales events in those
         locations. Nevertheless, they were not always sufficiently motivated to travel to
         remote target areas (due to high opportunity costs). Identifying village-based sales
         agents from CLTS-targeted villages, and combining a voluntary role as CLTS-village
         committee members with that of a sales agent can help strengthen business links54.
        Informed choice for dry toilets. Despite a strong preference for pour flush latrines
         among rural households, households may not be able to invest in such facilities
         immediately. This could be due to lack of savings and financing options, as well as a
         lack of a developed supply chain to provide easy access to a low-cost pour-flush
         latrine. Hence, households must also be informed about dry-pit (but easily
         upgradeable) options during the CLTS process, in order to enable villagers to stop
         open defecation sooner.

68.    A national sanitation marketing learning event took place in April 2014 and was
attended by representatives from 14 provinces across the country. In addition, officials from
the Health, Education and Rural Development offices of Luang Nam Tha, Oudomxay,
Saravan and Attapeu provinces, and staff from Plan International, visited Sekong and
Champasak to learn from the sanitation marketing approach in the field.

The development of a sanitation marketing toolkit
69.     A Sanitation Marketing Toolkit was produced, and is available in both English and
Lao languages. The toolkit is important to align sanitation marketing approaches
implemented by other development partners, and facilitate future replication in other regions.
This alignment will ensure that businesses are trained in set of Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and that a standardized business support structure can be developed in
future phases of sanitation marketing. The toolkit includes guides for market facilitators, as
well as workbooks and manuals for enterprises and sales agents (see illustrations in
70.     Figure 10):

        Business Skills Training for Sanitation Entrepreneurs: Facilitator’s Guide
        Business Skills for Sanitation Entrepreneurs: Participant’s Workbook
        Latrine Entrepreneur Operating Manual
        Latrine Production and Installation Training, Facilitator’s Guide
        Latrine Production Manual
        Latrine Sales Agent Training, Facilitator’s Guide
        Latrine Sales Agent Trainee Handbook
        Sanitation Marketing Implementation Manual
The purpose of the Sanitation Marketing Implementation Manual is to provide guidelines and
best practices for scaling up sanitation marketing in Lao PDR. It includes the messages, tools,

54
  All Nam Saat district staff and CLTS facilitators now have all the contact and business information from the
active sanitation enterprises, to further help create linkages as the CLTS program continues. Salaried
government staff and village chiefs are not eligible to work as sales representatives

                                                     31
and processes that have been most effective for implementing sanitation marketing. This
manual can be used by either public or private entities looking to replicate these efforts in
other regions of the country.
A promotional video to explain the concept of sanitation marketing has also been developed
and is available at http://youtu.be/aV4hYVgxmvM

Exploring potential for at-scale marketing platforms for increased sustainability
71.     Three models for the sustainable scale-up of sanitation marketing were considered:
one involving handover of sanitation marketing activities to various departments of the public
sector, and two involving the development of a social enterprise, franchise or association that
is able to deliver the services of the network to members and partially fund its own activities
through revenue generation.

72.     The first potential model for sustainable scale-up intended to use the Lao government
to provide business skills training, sales agent training, sales and promotional materials,
production and installation manuals, quality assurance services to sanitation enterprises, and
support rural microfinance initiatives. The Small and Medium Enterprise Development and
Promotion Office (SMEDPO) was evaluated as a potential actor for increasing capacity of
sanitation enterprises in business skills and sales force management, potentially through
collaboration with local vocational training programs. Provincial Nam Saat was considered
for playing the role of quality assurance auditor55. Without substantially increased financial
and human resources for SMEDPO, Nam Saat, or the presence of SME/TVET programs
dedicated to sanitation supply chains, these options do not present a viable model for scaling
up at this stage.

55
   Such roles would include observing latrine production on-site to evaluate procedures according to a set of
quality and safety standards, and checking installed latrines for quality and environmental health and safety
issues. Nam Saat is only able to carry out this role in a minimum spot-check capacity.

                                                       32
73.     Informed by a literature review and other global experiences, the pros and cons of
establishing either a social franchise or sanitation entrepreneur associations in the Lao context
were reviewed56. Although an association would present a scalable platform for recruitment,
training and management of the sales force, and for arranging business skills and latrine
production training for its members, such an association would require intensive support from
development partners and government alike. Due to the complexities of registering local civil
society organizations (CSO) in Lao PDR, a business association is not a feasible platform in
the medium term57.

74.     A social franchise would function by creating a value proposition for enterprises -
through a unifying brand - and would provide the same functions as mentioned above, i.e.
management of the sales force and business training in standard operating procedures. This
could possibly be expanded with providing additional technical and financial support services
to enterprises (access to loans) and discounted raw materials through the central franchisor.
The franchise model would require buy-in and cooperation from other development partners
and government. However, given the nascent sanitation market, this model lacks financial
feasibility at this stage58.

75.    The conclusion of this analysis is sobering but realistic, i.e. no viable scale-up
mechanism/platform currently seems appropriate for the current stage of sanitation market
development in Lao PDR. Nevertheless, a medium term scale-up strategy is proposed that
may not immediately address all sustainability concerns but is probably is the most realistic,
namely:
     A collaborative platform of government and all civil society organizations (and
       development partners) active in the sanitation space; potentially such a platform could
       be linked to the national Scaling-Up-Nutrition (SUN) initiative (i.e. an existing CSO
       platform is already in place)
     The alignment and implementation of a similar sanitation marketing approach59, with
       all CSOs using the national sanitation marketing toolkit; the marketing approach
       could be further expanded by anchoring this under the umbrella brand of a future
       nutrition BCC campaign.

76.     This collaborative model does not foresee support to a local sanitation marketing
entity (such as a social franchisor), that would provide the continuous support needed to
businesses and their sales force. However, a harmonized direct market facilitation model by
NGO partners can still offer efficiency benefits, as it would avoid fragmentation and
duplication of efforts.




56
   This detailed discussion and analysis (including financial analysis) is available in the completion report on
sanitation marketing.
57
   In Indonesia, a successful association model has been developed for sanitation enterprises, working in
partnership with the Ministry of Health in Indonesia. However, a local group of champion enterprises need to be
present, which currently does not yet exist in Lao PDR.
58
   A start-up model is necessary with a minimum of 20 paying members (franchise fee) all operating at the level
of the most successful enterprise at the end of the pilot implementation. These assumptions are not realistic at
this stage of sanitation market development.
59
   Tailoring and local adaptation for business models, sales strategies and/or products may still be necessary for
different regions.

4.3. Behavior Change Communications (BCC) for sanitation
77.    The process of producing BCC materials was initiated as a sector-wide effort, led by
Nam Saat, and co-funded through WSP, UNICEF, SNV and Plan (with most of the financing
from WSP). The objective was to develop an evidence-based sanitation campaign based on
formative research. A campaign logo and set of BCC materials would be developed that
could be used at-scale nationally in terms of communication objectives and messages.

78.    Formative research to inform drivers and barriers for stopping open
defecation and using latrines. Seven out of seventeen provinces were surveyed to
understand barriers and motivators for consumers to access sanitation services, using the
SaniFOAM framework60. Seventy four percent of household samples is ethnic minority
households which are living in rural remote regions with lower level of toilet ownership
compared with Lao-Tai group. It also covered a supply chain analysis to understand the most
common challenges for rural householders and businesses, and to inform the business models
that were piloted under the sanitation marketing approach (see section 4.2).The findings of
the research were shared widely and are summarized in the annexed infographic. Key
findings are illustrated in Table 3 below.

79.     The next step in the development of the BCC campaign was the agreement of the
creative brief for a creative agency, in which key parameters were set, such as the overall
campaign goal: in this case for households to stop open defecation, and build or buy and use a
latrine61. Communications objectives for the campaign were developed and requirements for
target audiences and communication channels were set. As per the formative research, the
main motivators for the campaign were privacy and respect, safety and convenience.

80.     It was confirmed that decision making around latrines was found to be a joint family
process, although men and women attached different benefits to owning and using a latrine.
Motivators for buying and using latrines were found to be quite homogeneous across
different ethnic groups, with convenience rating top rank. Messages to motivate
women/mothers to start the discussion around using a latrine at home focused on the benefits
of safety for defecation at night, privacy, as well as the convenience of owning a toilet also
with respect to child defecation practices. For men, respect from peers and recognition by the
government as a civilized member in the community were used.

81.     The materials and messages, including motivators addressed to both men and women,
underwent testing in various contexts, including among different ethnic groups, to ensure
identification and comprehension is good. Slogan and tag lines were tested, and BCC
material were mostly visual, as literacy is low, and officially endorsed materials can only be
developed in official Laotian (not in ethnic languages).

82.    While the campaign materials are still under development62, Table 4 lists the expected
content in terms of BCC materials, job-aids, training manuals and supportive advocacy
packages. An illustration of draft materials is shown in Figure 10.
61
   Many other behaviors are relevant for sanitation and hygiene, including for example the maintenance of the
latrine, the need for containment of animal waste, and the need for safe child feces disposal. However, due to
limited time and funds, the focus of the campaign thus far was one on household sanitation use. In addition for
handwashing with soap, messages and materials were developed earlier to be integrated in the CLTS process.
This also included the promotion and demonstration on how to build simple handwashing facilities.
62
   Unexpected delays took place due to suboptimal performance of the creative agency

83.    It is expected that the sanitation BCC materials will be included under the national
campaign for nutrition63, while being augmented by additional nutrition-related behaviors,
including infant and young child feeding, maternal nutrition, and also additional behaviors for
hygiene and sanitation (e.g. safe child feces disposal). The BCC materials are expected to be
used by CLTS facilitators and village-based nutrition communicators in the HGND project,
as well by kumban facilitators taken on roles for sanitation under the partnership between
Nam Saat and PRF.

4.4 Results for sanitation access and achievement of ODF villages
The rural sanitation program in Champasak and Sekong delivered the following results.

84.    Almost 42% (266 villages) of all 625 villages in the 10 districts benefitted from a
CLTS process in the period 2012-2016 (226 of the villages benefitted in 2014 and 2016).
Across 184 triggered villages (2014-2015), a total of 9,478 villagers (56% of them female)
attended the CLTS sessions.

85.     Sanitation access increased on average by 32% (from 38% to 69% between July 2014
and February 2016), with the increase varying across districts from 15% to 64%. The rate of
change in those villages is around 20% annually. This is eight times as fast as the national
rate of change for rural sanitation access from 2000 to 2015 (17% to 56%, which is 2.6% per
year).

86.     As a result of the CLTS process 6,600 households (around 39,600 people) have
started to use latrines,93% of which have been pour flush (7% are dry pit latrines, mostly in
Dakchung district).




                                             37
87.     Figure 12 shows the progress of sanitation access in the 226 CLTS villages for each
of the districts. While eight districts performed very well, much less progress was made in
Bajieng and Lamam districts, partly due to remoteness (Lamam), but also due to less active
Nam Saat staff involvement.

88.      In total, 113 (or 43%) of the 266 villages achieved Open Defecation Free status with
the earlier 40 villages (2012-2013) having an ODF achievement rate of around 70% (28 out
of 40), and the later batch of 226 villages (2014-2016) a rate of 38% (85 out of 226). The
latter rate may increase over time due to the continuation of Nam Saat activities, while it is
common that ODF achievement rates of at-scale CLTS programs are much lower as
compared to small pilots with intense handholding64.
89.      Below shows that Paksong, Pathounpone and Thatheng districts had the highest ODF
achievement rates. The high-performing district of Thateng already declared 35 out of 49
villages ODF by February 2016 and is expected to declare the entire district ODF in April
2016. However, although only few villages (or none at all) villages achieved ODF status, a
considerable number of households gained access to sanitation in the CLTS villages in the 10
districts. While achieving ODF remains an important collective target and can motivate
districts and communities65, substantial increases in sanitation access at village level -
without reaching the high bar of ODF - need to be recognized as important results.




64
   The motto “pilots never fail, pilots never scale” underscores the typically high ODF -achievement rates, in the
range of 50 to 75% for small-scale pilots (such as the 40 villages). A review of CLTS in the East Asia and
Pacific region (UNICEF, forthcoming) confirms ODF rates of 20-30% are more realistic within an at-scale
program.
65
   The impact evaluation in Sekong and Champasak will also test the effectiveness a cash incentive for villages
achieving ODF.

    This excludes households that gained access for the 40 villages where CLTS took place in 2012-2013


90.    Based on survey data, one in every five households that installed an improved latrine
(20%) in districts with marketing activities bought these from sanitation businesses trained
under the sanitation program. A total of 1465 latrines were sold through these businesses.
Since businesses did not register the villages of latrine sales, the number of latrines sold to
the CLTS villages cannot be determined. Although active linkages to CLTS villages were
made with the businesses, their sales agents would naturally also sell in other villages,
perhaps closer to the businesses. Hence it is likely that over 40,000 people in total gained
access due to the TA.

91.      Four customer satisfaction surveys were carried out over 2014-2015. In the final
       66
round , which was largest and most in-depth (n=160), 75% reported that the quality of their
latrine was “good” and 23% said it was “very good”. 93% of respondents reported having
their latrine delivered on time, and 91% were satisfied with the installation service from their
enterprise. Interestingly, 86% of respondents also reported that they thought their latrine was
not expensive, in other words, good value for money. The survey also showed that 80% of
households were still using their latrines six months after installation. 77% of households
reported that all members of the family used their latrine when they needed to defecate,
possibly pointing to low latrine usage when out in the field and by young children.

92.    In order to better understand the achievement and sustainability of ODF, a qualitative
research has recently been fielded in a sub-set of the 40 villages that were triggered as early
as 2011/1267.

93.     The research will help to understand what enabled fast change, who has been left
behind and what are the key barriers for some villages to start addressing their sanitation
situation. It is expected to be completed in April 2016 and will be used to further inform
government policy and future program design.

  Based on administrative data the reversion to open defecation (so-called “slippage”) is not expected to be very
high in this sample, as most households have pour-flush latrines, which are more durable and peasant to use as
dry traditional pits. This will be further investigated in the field research.

5. Conclusions and recommendations for way forward


5.1 Conclusions
94.     The TA program exposed numerous challenges in implementation and allowed rich
learning from the implementation in the two southern provinces. Key lessons and conclusions
are summarized below, emphasizing those with programmatic relevance that relate to
strengthening institutional service delivery systems. In addition a number of important
learnings at implementation level are highlighted, so that operational processes can be
improved to make last-mile delivery more effective and efficient.

Programmatic lessons for strengthening institutions for service delivery

   Engagement of national, provincial and district senior decision makers and
    administrators has not been sufficient to make adequate resources for implementation
    available in a timely fashion. This has hampered the effectiveness of the TA compared to
    an environment where domestic resource mobilization is agreed upfront, such as under a
    lending Operation.

95.      Provincial and district decision makers (vice governors, director and senior staff of
Health departments) were engaged through sanitation orientation roadshows. Moreover, the
Director of DHHP and Nam Saat were actively involved and mobilized the deputy minister of
MoH to attend national learning events and ODF celebrations, encouraging provinces and
districts to prioritize sanitation within their budget allocations. However, the reality on the
ground has been sobering: despite adequate planning, basic operational costs were
insufficient to execute rural sanitation promotion in most, but not all of the districts. This has
compromised the effectiveness of the TA, leading to delays in implementation and a reduced
scale of implementation compared to what was initially foreseen. Future technical assistance
would thus be best aligned in areas i) with less severe funding constraints, such as in WB
project areas, or ii) if domestic budget has been committed at the highest level and an – at
least partially - funded district plan is in place. In the latter case, technical assistance could be
made available on a demand-driven basis once district budgets have been secured.

   Supporting provinces and districts with practical planning and budgeting tools has
    helped to develop realistic implementation plans and mobilize a minimum level of
    operational resources to carry out sanitation activities. Top-level advocacy would be
    needed to allow a formal addition of rural sanitation as a dedicated sub-program budget
    line, recognize sanitation expenditure as an explicit sub-program.

96.      Since the programmatic approach is relatively new to many provincial and district
implementers, abilities to plan and budget for such “software” activities is limited (e.g.
operational costs for implementation of CLTS facilitation and training, and costs for market
facilitation). The use of practical planning and budgeting tools has helped districts to submit
implementation plans based on realistic targets given their limited staffing, indicating that
working in 15 new villages per district annually is already an ambitious level of
implementation. The absence of a dedicated budget line for rural sanitation spending has
hindered the planning and resource mobilization process. Top-level advocacy may be needed
to alter this situation and introduce rural sanitation as a dedicated sub-program.



                                                 42
   Human resources at Nam Saat district level are constraining district-wide
    implementation of a rural sanitation programmatic approach. Existing human capital at
    kumban and village level developed under the Poverty Reduction Fund can support the
    efficiency of rural sanitation service delivery. Such a partnership does not replace the
    institutional mandate and technical leadership from the Ministry of Health, in particular
    Nam Saat for sanitation. A scale-up will require district health offices to make funds
    available. Only then the efficiency gains from the pilot partnership with PRF can be
    consolidated through a district-wide approach

97.      With long travelling distances from district to village level, numerous and widely
dispersed villages in each district (around 80), and around 1-2 Nam Saat staff at district level,
last mile service delivery becomes a daunting task. A partnership between Nam Saat and PRF
as service delivery platform can leverage well trained human resources for social
mobilization and collective village plan implementation (i.e. kumban facilitators and village
implementation teams). In the pilot partnership under this TA, limited to 40 villages across
six districts, operational resources for Nam Saat to execute their role in the partnership were
not available at the time they were required and thus were covered through the TA. The
pilot‘s focus was on operational learning of the integration process and identifying lessons for
deeper engagement beyond CLTS. The limited number of villages per district in the pilot
means that efficiency gains will not yet be fully realized but could be maximized if capacities
are consolidated through a district-wide approach in the scale-up.

   Developing national guidelines, toolkits and training materials through government-led
    and sector-wide collaboration is essential to ensure government adoption of the
    programmatic approach and wide uptake of such packages by other partners and
    projects. Close institutional coordination with government and partner nutrition
    stakeholders can help to scale-up the implementation of the sanitation programmatic
    approach, including CLTS, BCC and sanitation market development.

98.      World Bank/WSP, UNICEF, SNV, Plan International and other NGOs successfully
assisted DHHP and Nam Saat in developing the required guidelines, tools and manuals for
the implementation of a demand-responsive programmatic approach. Examples are the
operational guidelines for rural sanitation, the sanitation marketing toolkit, the CLTS training
package, and the sanitation BCC toolkit. Conducting in-depth annual learning events, as well
as exposure visits on several aspects of the programmatic approach has been essential for
consensus and capacity building among national and provincial staff. With sanitation now
being a priority intervention component of the national nutrition action plan, the replication
of the programmatic approach, using government adopted packages and tools, is likely to
result in harmonized and more efficient service delivery.

   Developing sanitation related knowledge, capacities and skills of existing and future staff
    of district and provincial health offices and Nam Saat requires institutional anchoring
    with relevant local universities and schools, such as the University of Health and Science,
    and potentially other institutes for in-service training.

99.    Inspired through the national sanitation training program in Indonesia, DHHP has led
a process to engage the University of Health and Science to integrate sanitation-related
content, including CLTS, into the Program of Public Health. Institutionalizing training
programs on sanitation for existing and new health staff in district and provincial health

                                               43
offices/Nam Saat, requires a comprehensive longer-term effort to develop and test the
curriculum, obtain formal approval on module credits and examination standards, and ensure
adequate training of lecturers.

    Sanitation marketing and supply chain development are not an “easy” fit with existing
     capacities of district and provincial Nam Saat staff. Ensuring a clear articulation of
     governments supporting role in market facilitation is critical. Given the nascent nature of
     the sanitation market in Lao PDR, a collaborative model is proposed for the medium term
     to provide external NGO-led facilitation and support to private sector actors.

100. Three models for the sustainable scale-up of sanitation marketing were considered:
one involving handover of sanitation marketing activities to various departments of the public
sector, and two involving the development of a social enterprise (franchise) or association
that is able to deliver value-adding services to its members and partially fund its own
activities through revenue generation. However, none of these options are deemed feasible at
this stage of rural sanitation market development. A collaborative direct market facilitation
model by NGO partners is most appropriate and can still offer efficiency benefits, as it would
avoid fragmentation and duplication of efforts through the use of the national sanitation
marketing toolkit.


Operational lessons for strengthening last-mile delivery

101. Informed by the implementation challenges in Champasak and Sekong provinces, the
following operational lessons have emerged:

    Regular capacity building for CLTS: High turnover of district CLTS/sanitation teams is a
     given in the context of Lao PDR, and needs to be factored in the capacity building costs
     required to maintain CLTS capabilities at district level.
    Articulation of district and village roles: District and village leadership and a clear
     understanding of their respective roles is critical for achieving progress. This includes
     their role in facilitating linkages with businesses and coordinating events with village-
     based agents. Once the BCC toolkit has been developed, village Sanitation committee
     members and/or nutrition communicators can strengthen the CLTS process through
     additional interpersonal communication events and household visits.
    Understanding ODF achievement-rates: Realistic expectations for ODF achievement
     rates are needed in a larger-scale program and need to be combined with recognizing
     success in terms of increases in sanitation access.
    Financing mechanisms for the poorest households. Villages with supply-driven,
     untargeted subsidies were difficult to motivate. However, given the lack of viable
     financing options and consumer preferences to save for toilets, partial smart subsidies
     may be needed to help the poorest invest in a durable latrine68. A harmonization of pro-
     poor support is needed with a clear targeting mechanism and without undermining the
     nascent market (e.g. vouchers or household output-based cash transfers).




68
  The ongoing qualitative research on achieving ODF (By April 2016) as well as the impact evaluation (by
August 2016) will shed more light on which households have been left behind through implementing CLTS and
sanitation marketing

                                                   44
    Adaptation of products, services and business models. Once demand is created, there is a
     clear willingness to pay for high-quality pour-flush toilets in the range of USD 65-9069.
     Very high satisfaction was found with both product and the services of One Stop Shops70.
     In remote areas, it is still important to promote dry pit options as a low-cost alternative to
     stop open defecation, while households may save or wait until the harvest season to invest
     in a more durable latrine. Self-construction and sourcing of materials through local
     retailers may continue to be necessary due to a lack of businesses that could qualify as
     One-Stop-Shops.
    Ongoing support and incentives to motivate business and sales agents. Maintaining the
     interest of local businesses and sales agents in sanitation marketing requires pro-active
     and continuous engagement from an external market facilitation agency with Nam Saat
     support. One-Stop-Shops benefit from a close collaboration with districts government and
     village leaders, while sales agents are best recruited among village volunteer cadre to
     avoid conflict of interest with public roles. Structuring incentives to maintain motivation
     is critical.


5.2 Recommendations and way forward


Recommendations for the Ministry of Health

1. Development of a national rural sanitation sub-program with dedicated budget line under
MoH
102. Advocacy is needed so that the new programmatic rural sanitation approach can be
adopted widely and provincial health offices and Nam Saat receive the funding they need to
go to scale. Rather than as a sparsely funded sub-activity under MoH’s national program on
Health and Hygiene Promotion, the establishment of a sub-program on rural sanitation and
hygiene would be best71. The program budget – in addition to salaries - would have to cover
expenditures for basic operational costs, CLTS and BCC activities, pro-poor incentives,
monitoring and other indirect sector coordination cost. The development of a harmonized
financing guideline will need to be part of such program, articulating a policy for pro-poor
support and incentives for village ODF achievement in the context of the existing inequalities
in access. To meet the national sanitation access target of 80 per cent by 2020, over 200,000
people would need to gain access annually (2017-2020). This translates into a minimum
budget requirement of USD 2.3 to 2.8 million annually, or USD 10.8 million over the 2017-
2020 period (an annual investment of USD 14 per capita). It assumes that USD 3.8 million is
allocated over this period for targeted subsidies to poor, USD 1 million for ODF-awards, and
the remaining 55 per cent for software expenditures. This budget estimate does not include
the recurrent administration and salary costs of government at different levels, neither does it
include external technical assistance for market development.
2. Integration of rural sanitation program, especially CLTS, sanitation marketing and BCC
within multi-sectoral nutrition programs and particularly the government’s nutrition Social
and Behavior Change Communications Strategy.

69
   This is for the underground and mid structure, excluding shelter and transport.
70
   Of those that bought their toilet at a One Stop Shop, 80% used the installation service and 20% self-installed.
71
   This could also include rural water supply, however, the government is currently considering of the rural
water supply mandate should not be transferred to the newly created Department of Water Supply under
MPWT.

                                                       45
103. With increased funding allocated to nutrition, including the World Bank-funded
HGNDP as well as USAID and future EU/UNICEF support, the government has the
opportunity to integrate rural sanitation activities across all these programs (already foreseen
for HGNDP), maximizing the use of the national toolkits, sanitation BCC materials and
training manuals developed under this TA. The materials and messages (ongoing
development), including motivators address to both men and women have been included
(e.g. a focus on privacy and safety for women, and for men motivators that speak to gaining
respect from community and government as a model civilized family). . Motivators for
stopping open defecation and latrine usage were found to be rather similar among different
ethnic groups, and hence a unified set of BCC materials is appropriate, provided messages are
verbally delivered in local languages using mostly visuals, as literacy is low (also officially
endorsed materials can only be developed in official Laotian, not in ethnic languages).
Another concrete example is for MoH to promote the use of the sanitation marketing toolkit
under the CSO Forum of the Scaling-Up Nutrition Initiative, since donors as EU and USAID
will continue to implement nutrition and WASH programs with the help of NGO partners.

3. Mobilize high level ministerial support and guarantee funding commitment to scale-up
sanitation service delivery through Poverty Reduction Fund.
104. Informed by the lessons of the pilot partnership between Nam Saat and PRF, a
realistic scale-up plan needs to be developed, reflecting allocations for minimum operational
budgets for Nam Saat in a selected number of districts. This commitment is required to
effectively lead the partnership and ensure the institutional mandate of Nam Saat is
sufficiently funded to reap the efficiency gains of working in partnership with the PRF.

4. Support the institutionalization of a capacity development program for sanitation skills
targeted at existing and future health staff at district and provincial levels
105. The ongoing collaboration between Nam Saat and the University of Health and
Science needs to be pursued so that sanitation-related curriculum can be implemented from
academic year 2017 onward. Also, opportunities to integrate sanitation curriculum into other
appropriate training institutes, such as for health centre outreach workers, need to be seized,
drawing on the guidance and tools produced under this TA.


Recommendations for World Bank

1. Aligning Water Global Practice technical assistance strategically with HGNDP Operation
106. Sanitation is already an integral and costed part of HGNDP, and Nam Saat is one of
the implementing partners under DHHP. Hence, the financial resource environment for
implementing CLTS combined with integrated sanitation and hygiene BCC activities, as part
of wider village-level nutrition SBCC interventions, are well secured. To ensure optimal
effectiveness of future TA, a geographic focus on the 12 districts in four provinces of
HGNDP’s community interventions is recommended, with the following focal areas:
 Assistance for sanitation marketing and market facilitation: this function cannot yet be
    delivered through district Nam Saat or other public agencies72. Thus complementary
    bank-executed TA is justified to make affordable and accessible products available to
    rural households once demand is created. This TA should also include capacity building
    for district, kumban and village-cadres to help facilitate linkages with local supply chain
    actors and villages CLTS/sanitation committees.

72
     Or through another national platform that would support marketing (such as a franchise or association)

                                                         46
    Assistance to expand behavioral focus of sanitation and hygiene BCC to “baby WASH” :
     as part of HGNDP – with complementary support of EU/UNICEF – SBCC materials,
     including mass media, for a range of nutrition and WASH behaviors will be further
     developed, integrating the sanitation BCC toolkit which is already available.
     Complementary Bank executed TA will be made available to provide technical guidance
     to this process, with a special focus to include so-called “baby-WASH” interventions73.
     Behaviors to be addressed, which are deemed to be particularly relevant for stunting
     prevention, are: i) safe disposal of child feces, and ii) separating infants and toddlers from
     chicken and other animal feces.

107. In addition, Bank-executed TA will be used to provide increased implementation
support during HGNDP implementation, due to the low capacity environment in target
districts.

2. Scaling-up and deepening the scope of collaboration between Nam Saat and PRF under
PRF374
108. Informed by an evaluation of the pilot partnership, a detailed scale-up strategy will be
developed. However, given the known risks of having inadequate resource for Nam Saat to
carry out their mandate, the following two-pronged approach for horizontal scaling is
recommended:
     Going district-wide in the six pilot districts: Since capacities of Nam Saat, PRF
        district and selected kumban facilitators have been developed already, a gradual
        horizontal scaling in the six pilot districts is proposed, with scope and timeline
        dictated by Nam Saat operational budget availability. Once a district implementation
        plan has been agreed between PRF and Nam Saat, and district funds from Nam Saat
        have been released, demand-responsive Bank executed TA will be mobilized in the
        following areas: i) capacity building of Nam Saat and PRF kumban facilitators in
        CLTS and BCC, ii) marketing support to identified local latrine suppliers, iii)
        monitoring support, and iv) lesson sharing and evaluation across districts. World
        Bank will also aim to bring in other partners and NGOs working in these districts.
     Geographic expansion of pilot to HGNDP districts: Although financial resources may
        be sufficient for Nam Saat in HGNDP districts, a constraining factor for
        implementation will be human resource levels. Hence, the 12 districts form an ideal
        location for leveraging kumban facilitators and village implementation teams, whose
        members would be selected to lead the CLTS/sanitation village committee or who
        may be recruited as village nutrition facilitators75. Complementary Bank executed TA
        would focus on capacitating Nam Saat and PRF district and kumban facilitators76 and
        overall implementation support to allow rapid learning for a streamlining of the
        standard operating procedures. Scale and timeline for expansion of Nam Saat – PRF
        partnership under HGNDP needs to be defined77.

Sanitation, Hygiene, and Nutrition in Bangladesh: Can Building Toilets Affect Children's Growth?. World Bank
Study;. Washington, DC: World Bank
74
   While not covered this report, additional bank executed TA is also planned to help improve the sustainability
of rural water schemes under PRF3, through piloting a number of management and post construction support
models
75
   Both men and women are required for these roles.
76
   This would focus on technical support, as financial resources are available under HGNDP and PRF3 for direct
training costs of CLTS implementers
77
   Proposed scaling model is to work in a few districts in 1 province, aiming to cover 15-20 villages annually,
and then expanding to districts in other provinces.

                                                      47
      Working with kum ban facilitators as sales agents. Since these facilitators are
       volunteers with small allowances, covering multiple villages, KBF would be excellent
       candidates to be further trained in facilitating supply chain linkages and acting as
       sales agents under PRF3. The TA will focus on fostering this innovation.
109. Finally, it is proposed that TA will be used for expanding the scope of the partnership
by developing detailed technical guidance for PRF to support potential financing mechanisms
under PRF378, such as:
  i. the use of Self Help Groups or more formal saving and loan schemes that allow
       households to invest in sanitation;
 ii. the use of infrastructure and/or livelihood grants for pro-poor support for the poorest
       households in the community. This would only be possible upon prioritization of the
       community and the development of an ODF-plan, as well as transparent criteria for
       eligibility of poor households.

3. Programmatic and policy assistance and advocacy for rural sanitation
110. It is recommended that the World Bank would engage in high-level dialogue with
Ministry of Health on prioritizing resources for rural sanitation, specifically to articulate a
sub-program and financing guideline under the new WASH policy, slated for approval by
mid-2016. In order to ensure the effectiveness of future TA, a joint work program would be
developed with MoH’s DHHP that would ideally rely on a combination of TA and domestic
resources. Areas for future assistance would focus on key institutional gaps:

        monitoring for sanitation: synergies could be developed with the ongoing initiative to
         expand the DHMIS with additional nutrition-relevant indicators;
        human resource development: partnership with the University of Health and Science
         would be continued and expanded to other relevant human resource development
         initiatives for the health system79;
        knowledge management: resources would be used to document, disseminate and share
         lessons and solutions for WASH-nutrition integration that are relevant nationally as
         well as globally.




78
   This is especially relevant since HGNDP does not provide any partial support or financing mechanism to poor
households
79
   Potentially the human resources development program financed by ADB for health workers may benefit
from inclusion/updating of sanitation and hygiene modules

                                                     48

                                   Cooperative Agreement

                                            Between

          National Center for Environmental Health and Water Supply (Nam Saat),

                                              and

                           National Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF)

                   For a Pilot Partnership Program on Rural Sanitation

Presently, 93% of all Laotians without access to improved latrines live in rural areas,
especially in poor and remote parts of the country. This is a main cause of health problems,
especially diarrheal disease and stunting in those areas. In line with the 8th National Socio-
Economic Development Plan (NSEDP), Government of Lao PDR (GoL) aims to improve
rural sanitation and mandated the National Center for Environmental Health and Rural
Water Supply (Nam Saat) under the Ministry of Health (MoH) to improve the delivery of
rural sanitation services. The Operational Guidelines issued by MoH in 2014 provide
concrete directions to achieve Open Defecation Free villages, based on a process of demand
creation using a community mobilization approaches, called Community-Led Total sanitation
(CLTS), combined with supply side interventions to strengthen the local supply chain of
sanitation services. Typically Nam Saat’s role is to facilitate a community awakening
(“triggering”), where villagers are motivated to collectively stop open defecation and start
building and using latrines under the guidance of a self-formed village CLTS committee.
Nam Saat’s role is to follow-up and support the communities by facilitating linkages with
local sanitation suppliers and trained masons so as to offer villagers a choice of toilet options
they like and can afford. For those villages where everyone is motivated to invest in and use a
latrine, Nam Saat will carry out a verification process, after which the Open Defecation Free
status is declared and the community receives official recognition for this achievement. In
addition to its rural sanitation mandate, Nam Saat also provides rural water supply

                                               54
infrastructure, capacity building and support to user groups and village authorities, to whom
the infrastructure assets are handed over.

The Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF), under the supervision of the National Committee for
Rural Development and Poverty Reduction, is mandated to help the GoL implement its policy
to reduce rural poverty in line with the 8th NSEDP. It operates in 44 poor districts in 10
provinces, and implements bottom-up planning processes and provides communities block
grants to implement priority infrastructure subprojects. The PRF has also started to support
investments to improve the livelihood and nutritional status of villagers on a pilot basis. To
carry out these programs, the PRF has trained many village level leaders, including Kum ban
Facilitators (KBF) and Village Implementation Teams (VIT). There are two to three KBF in
every kum ban where the PRF operates, and 44% of them are women. The VIT consists of
village leaders selected by villagers to implement infrastructure subprojects. The PRF
provides them repeated training in leadership, community facilitation and bottom-up
processes. The village level institutions and kum ban human resources that the PRF has
developed are considered to provide a useful platform through which multiple agencies, in
cooperation with the PRF, can deliver last mile services at a lower cost. Under such
cooperation, the relevant partner agency, such as Nam Saat, would assume the institutional
mandate for sector specific issues, such as sanitation for the case of Nam Saat, and is overall
accountable for achieving the ultimate objective of the partnership, such as ODF in the case
of the partnership with Nam Saat. At the same time, such cooperation is aligned with and
supports the PRF’s objectives of poverty reduction.

The Nam Saat and the PRF have hereby agreed to enter into a partnership on a pilot basis to
allow the Nam Saat to use the PRF village platform to implement sanitation activities. To
support this partnership, the World Bank team, through the Global Water Practice - Water
and Sanitation Partnership (WSP) will provide Nam Saat and the PRF necessary technical
assistance and implementation support.

The partnership will be implemented in 40 villages, in 27 village clusters (kum bans), and 6
districts within four of the PRF’s target provinces over a duration of about 11 months from
Oct 2015 to Sept 2016:

   1. Savannakhet Province: four villages in Nong district and 10 villages in Sepon District;
   2. Salavan Province: 6 villages in Ta Oi District;
   3. Xekong province: 10 villages in Toumlan District and 4 villages in Darkcheuang
      District;
   4. Attapeu Province: 6 villages in Phouvong District.

Note: The increase in sanitation access and ODF success rate for the target villages under the
Partnership is expected to vary, depending upon the willingness of the villagers, access to
finance and saving mechanisms, availability of supply chain, and conditions of access roads.
The results of Partnership will be evaluated at the end of pilot phase to inform expansion or
replication to other provinces. The principles of cooperation articulated in this agreement



                                              55
may be revised or retained and the scope of activities may be expanded depending upon the
evaluation of the pilot phase.
