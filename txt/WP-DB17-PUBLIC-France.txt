This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on t he

      The Centre de Formalités des Entreprises (CFE) handles all formalities
      related to the trade register in the court (RCS, Tribunal de Commerce),
      statistics (INSEE), tax authorities (Centre des Impôts), social security
      (URSSAF), labor (Direction Departemental du Travail et de L’emploi),
      health insurance (Caisse regionale D’assurance Maladie),
      unemployment insurance, pension, Employment Pole (Pole Emploi), and
      similar bodies.

      The company's Articles of Association and bylaws, lease, attestation of
      receipt of funds, documents concerning the manager, ad hoc forms,
      evidence of publication, and so forth must be filed in a single file. After
      receiving the request, the CFE must process the documents and transfer
      them to the respective offices and authorities. If the request is
      incomplete, the CFE has 15 days to return the documents for
      completion. The CFE automatically enters the information in the
      Registre Nationale des Entreprise (Répertoire SIRENE) and obtains           Less than one day

      number (Nomenclature des Activitees Francaises). The SIRET is used,
      among other things, by the tax authorities.

      Since the Dutreil Law, the CFE or the Commercial Registry can deliver a
      receipt for company creation (récepissé de creation d’entreprise) as
      soon as they have received the documents, so that the company can
      start operations without having to wait for its RCS number.

      The registration process can be done online via the Guichet Unique
      portal or Infogreffe web portal after creating a personal account to
      connect, unless there is a regulated activity (for example, hairdresser,
      butcher, Realtor or lawyer) requiring prior authorization not yet possible
      on the website for all regulated professions.

      Though the CFE does not charge the entrepreneurs for this procedure,
      49.92 euros must be paid at the CFE to register in the Commercial
      Court.

        Special accounting company books must be bought from the court or

        company must purchase the minutes of the records and the ledger and
        have these books initialed by the clerk of the Commercial Court.

        The books have numbered pages or numbered sheets, both of which
        must be certified by the Commercial Court. If a book with numbered
        pages is used, the certification is made only once (when the company is
        incorporated). If numbered sheets are used, the certification must be                    EUR 30 for two

        In theory, it is possible to have an electronic minute book provided that
        the procedure to draft the document is secured (to avoid document
        modification once it is drafted). Such a solution is rarely used because a
        secured procedure has not been clearly defined and the commercial
        court certification is more complicated in that case. It is also possible for
        the company to acquire the book later, after it starts operation.

        There are two types of an urbanism certificate:
        • Form A informative -- The informative form is a request to only
        establish the existing planning state of a building.
        • Form B operational -- The second is an operational planning
        certificate. In addition to information provided by the
        informative planning certificate, this certificate indicates if the
        land can be used for a project and the existing or planned state
        of public utilities (channels and networks) to serve or serve this
        land.

        A planning certificate is valid for 18 months and can be renewed
        2 months prior to its expiration. The request for a planning
        certificate must be submitted at the City Hall where the lot is
        located using a form Cerfa N° 13410*01. The average time to
        process the operational planning certificate is 2 months. If no
        answer is given within these 2 months, the silent-is-consent rule
        applies.

      Obtain building permit

      To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must submit the following:
      • Location plan (orientation, access roads) and overall plan of the
      construction or renovation (dimensions, elevations, connections,
      access), drawn up on grounds of the Land Registry–based map,
      representing the plot
      • Front elevations
      • Views, cross sections, layout
      • Document with a detailed description of the project impact on
      the existing landscape to prove that it is environmentally friendly
      • Survey photographs (both near- and long-range), allowing for
      the easy identification of the site in relation to the surrounding
      areas

      To prepare this documentation, BuildCo must obtain the building
      permit forms from City Hall or on the Internet through the Booth
      for Forms (Guichet des formulaires) of the Equipment, Transport,
      and Housing Ministry (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports
      et du Logement) (www.equipement.gouv.fr/). Four copies of the
      application are filed at City Hall and a receipt is given in person
      or it may be sent by registered mail with acknowledgement of
      receipt. If one document is missing, claims must be made within
      14 days after registration. Where the application is accompanied
      by all the required documents, the contractor will receive
      acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the date and registration
      number and the time needed for title investigation.                   90 days      EUR 42,751
3
      The building permit will be issued within 3 months after
      registration of the application (except where the plot is a
      classified site). The contractor shall deem the permit tacitly
      granted if no reply is received within the 3 month period. The
      building permit is valid for 2 years. The contractor must begin
      work (or apply for an extension) within that time; otherwise, the
      permit expires. Moreover, if the contractor halts work for over a
      year, the validity of the permit expires, even if the 2-year
      statutory period has not yet elapsed. The permit must be
      displayed at the construction site and must include all the
      requisite information: mandatory dimensions, building permit
      number and date of issue, name of permit holder, nature of the
      work, and the address of City Hall where construction documents
      are open to public scrutiny.

      A copy of the building permit must be available in City Hall for 2
      months to enable any aggrieved third parties (i.e., adjacent
      property owners) to challenge it.

      The application form to connect to sewage is also included when
      requesting a building permit. The application is to the addressed
      to the Sanitation department of Ville de Paris.

        completion is filed, an official from City Hall or the Equipment
        Departmental Directorate (Direction Départementale de
   9    l’Équipement, DDE) then visits the site to verify whether the          1 day        no charge
        structure conforms to building permit specifications. The
        compliance certificate is issued within 3 months of the
        application if the specifications are met.

The electricity connection:
                                                               If multiple electricity suppliers exist, the warehouse
    Is a permanent one.                                        is served by the cheapest supplier.
    Is a three-phase, four-wire Y connection with a           Tariffs effective in March of the current year are

     kilowatt (kW).                                             calculation purposes only 30 days are used.
    Has a length of 150 meters. The connection is to
     either the low- or medium-voltage distribution
     network and is either overhead or underground,
     whichever is more common in the area where the
     warehouse is located
    Requires works that involve the crossing of a 10-
     meter road (such as by excavation or overhead
     lines) but are all carried out on public land. There
     is no crossing of other owners’ private property
     because the warehouse has access to a road.
    Includes only a negligible length in the
     customer’s private domain.
    Does not require work to install the internal
     wiring of the warehouse. This has already been
     completed up to and including the customer’s
     service panel or switchboard and the meter base.

        The connection application form and the list of documents required for
        this application are available on the website of ERDF.

        Along with the application, the client needs to submit the following
        documents:
        • information about the company, the site, and the project contact
        people

      Upon receipt of the complete file, ERDF then carries out a technical study
      and sends the customer a connection proposal. This document contains:
      - A description of the technical solution selected, detailing the work that
      the applicant must carry out before the intervention of ERDF,
      - A provisional timetable for the execution of the works,
      - The contacts of an ERDF advisor, which will handle the case
      - The connection agreement, which details the technical, legal and
      financial elements for the connection of the electrical installation and the
      operating rules of this facility.
      - The period of validity of the proposal is 3 months.

      Receive external inspection by ERDF

      After receiving the application, Electricité Réseau Distribution France
      (ERDF) inspects the site to determine the material needed for the
      external works and final connection, and will send the client either an
*2    estimate of the connection fees or the requirements for the connection,        1 calendar day        EUR 0
      both technical and financial.

      Agency: Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF)



      Receive external works from ERDF

      For the works to start, the client needs to pay at least 50% of the
      estimate of fees. Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF) then
      generates an identification number that will be used in all its future
      communications with the client, and especially when the client will
      request the final connection (energization) from their electricity supplier.
      ERDF will also indicate an expected date for the end of the external
      works and, a date after which the service can be energized.

      As soon as the client has received this information, they can contact their
      electricity supplier to prepare the supply contract required for the final
3     connection.                                                                 47 calendar days     EUR 13,413.3

      The connection process might also require works to be done in the
      public or private domain. In this case ERDF will obtain all any necessary
      administrative permits.
      These procedures might cause additional delays in the process, but are
      taken into account in the schedule estimates provided by the utility
      along with the connection requirements.

      Once the works are completed, the client’s private electrical installation
      or site is connected to the public distribution network. The client should
      not wait for the external works to end in order to undertake the
      necessary procedures needed to obtain a conformity certificate of

        Obtain compliance certificate for internal wiring

        The customer can choose any private electrician for the internal wiring.
        At the end of the works, they will need to request a conformity certificate
        from a control body, such as CONSUEL, that may check the entire
        internal installation to make sure it is conforming to the regulation NF C
        15-100. The type of Consuel certificate needed in this case is an
        "Attestation de conformité "VERTE" ("Locaux à réglementations
        particulières").

        In order to obtain a copy of the form to fill out, the client will need to
        write to CONSUEL (http://www.consuel.com/visa.htm#1). The client will         20 calendar days      EUR 43.59

        need to attach the establishing shot (« plan de situation ») to the
        application. .

        CONSUEL may conduct an inspection based on a risk-assessment
        system. In any case, a certificate will be issued which Electricité Réseau
        Distribution France will check when carrying out the final connection




        Agency: CONSUEL



        Sign supply contract and obtain meter installation and final

        The energy supplier will propose a supply contract to the client. Once the
        customer has signed the contract, the supplier will request the final
        connection from Electricité Réseau Distribution France on the client’s     4 calendar days          EUR 155.3

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       these reports the seller would remain liable towards the purchaser if
       termites or asbestos were found in the future. Termites Certificate was

      2 months, then the preemption rights have been waived. It may be the
      case that the city informs the notary before the 2 months. There are
      some exemptions: if the building has been completed in the last 10 years
      or if the lot sold (used for residential purpose) is in a building where the
      co-ownership rules have been published at the land registry more than
      10 years ago. Properties when the whole lot and building are sold will
      need the waiver for preemption rights. In practice it takes around 3
      weeks on average to obtain this waiver.

        The notary can send the documents to the Land Registry immediately
        after the signature of the deed, personally or electronically through
        Tele@ctes. Simultaneously, the notary pays to the Land Registry the
        publicity tax and the salary of the registrar on behalf of the purchaser
        (the value added tax is paid by the company directly). The original deed
        of sale (called the “minutes”) remains with the notary for 75 years.
        The Land Registry will verify the transaction (name and date of birth of
        person should coincide with the Conservation’s records; parcel & section
        catastrale). The transfer of property is opposable to third parties after
        publication of the deed by the land registry office.
        On completion the vendor’s creditors if any, must execute a deed of
        discharge or release of the existing mortgages benefiting to them.

        electronically (for publication of the "acte authetique de vente" in order
        to make it opposable to third parties) . This rate has been increasing
        consistently during 2009. This makes the system faster and reduces the
        chances for errors, because the Conservation employees do not have to
        input information manually into the system. Data is inserted
        electronically into the Fiji system automatically from Teleactes. Land
        registries are proactively inviting notaries to participate in the electronic
        system, with a positive response from notaries.
        At this point, first the notary prepares the deed of sale with his own
        software, prints and has it signed by the parties. Then he inputs the
        information again in a separate screen of Teleactes to submit it to the
        Service de Publicite Fonciere for publication.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

Table 11.1 Details of data on efficiency of insolvency proceedings in France
 Indicator        Answer                                        Explanation
                                In France, the legislator stresses preventive procedures that can benefit
                           companies that are not yet in insolvent. But, under the case study assumptions,
                           Mirage is already insolvent because it cannot pay the money owed to BizBank.
                           Therefore, there are two possibilities – other than out-of-court procedures-: (i)
                            ask the opening of a judicial reorganization procedure, (ii) request liquidation.
                             Because Mirage’s managements want to continue the company operating, it
                                          will request the opening of reorganization proceedings.

Proceeding
             attempt at    reorganization procedure can be chosen in the case of Mirage. The opening of
           reorganization)       reorganization proceedings will stop payments of pre-commencement
                           creditors and impose a moratorium during the observation period (12 months
                            and exceptionally 18). This would enable Mirage to obtain from Mirage, either
                              a return of the outstanding debt, or more time to repay that would not last
                               more than 10 years. But it is likely that the procedure will be converted to
                                     liquidation if Mirage cannot respect the engagements fixed in its
                                 reorganization plan or if it is manifestly impossible to agree on a plan.


                                    If Mirage is liquidated, its activity could be provisionally continued to enable
                                      potential buyers to present offers to maintain all or part of the assets and
Outcome       going concern
                                              activities. The activity will then be continued by the buyer.


                                    According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted
                                   into liquidation takes approximately 23 months. The observation period would
                                         take six months, if it is not renewed. If the procedure is converted to
                                     liquidation, the court fixes the time after which the closure of the procedure

does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance

business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
