Iam very pleased to introduce the first in a series of Somalia Economic Updates. With this series, the
 World Bank aims to shine a spotlight on Somalia’s economy, assess economic trends, and provide regular
analysis that we hope generates debate among Somalis both inside and outside the country.

The first edition is titled Transition amid Risks. Like others, the Bank is encouraged by the progress that
Somalis have made in the last three years to rebuild their country. Against immense challenges, reforms
to economic and public finance management are setting new standards of accountable governance
and sustainable development for Somalia. These changes are essential if the country is to generate the
investment, services, and jobs that its youthful population need. So far, there are positive signs that the
economy is responding: Somalis are returning from abroad, shops are opening, new financial institutions
have been licensed,and property markets are booming.

However, the challenges are still daunting. Macro-fiscal management, revenue mobilization, and the
enactment of key legislation are all still in need of continued attention and support. Businesses, as vibrant
and as central as they have been in Somalia’s story, may soon reach the limits of their growth if the state
fails to provide the public goods that any private sector needs: physical security, security of contracts, and
regulation that ensures fair competition, a level playing field, and the basis for investment.

The first in this series of economic updates features a Special Focus on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations.
It is timely that Somalis engage in a structured and technically informed debate about the nature of
economic and fiscal relations within Somalia. At its heart, intergovernmental fiscal relations is about
economic solidarity. Like any country, Somalia will have natural inequities across regions and among
people. The response to these inequities will lay the foundations for longer-term development.

We hope you find this first edition valuable and look forward to our continued engagement in Somalia.

W      axaan aad ugu farax sanahay inaan idiin soo bandhigo taxanihii koowaad ee Warbixinta Dhaqaalaha
       Soomaaliya, Bangiga Adduunka isagoo ka duulaya qoraaladan taxana ah ujeedadiisuna tahay inu
ifiyo dhaqaalaha Soomaaliya, si uu u baaro aragtiyaha dhaqaale ee jira, soona gudbiyo falanqayn joogta
ah taas oo aan rajaynayno inay ka soo baxaan doodo dhex mara dhamaan dadka Soomaaliyeed ee dal iyo
dibadba joogta.

Qoraalka kowaad waxaa cinwaan looga dhigay MAAREYNTA KHATARTA XAALADA KALA GUURKA. Sida
qolyaha kaleba qabaan, wuxuu Bangiga Adduunku bogaadiyay horumarka ay Soomaalidu ka samaysay
xaga dib u dhiska dalkeeda saddexdi sano ee la soo dhaafay. Ka sakow caqabadaha baaxada leh ee
jira, isbedelada dhaqaale iyo maaraynta nidaamka maaliyadeedba waxay jaangoynayaan heerarka isla
xisaabtanka, maamul-wanaaga iyo joogtaynta horumarka Soomaaliya. Isbedeladdani waa kuwo muhiimad
u leh marka dalku abuurayo maalgashi, adeegyo, iyo shaqooyinka ay u baahan yihiin dadweynaha
dhalinyarada u badan. Inta la ogyahay, waxaa jira calaamado muujinaya in dhaqaaluhu soo hagaagayo:
Soomaalidii dibadaha ayey ka soo noqonayaan, waxaa la furanaya Dukaamo, hay’ado maaliyadeed oo
cusub baa ayaa ruqsadihii samaystay, iyo suuqa hantida ma guurtada ah oo sare u sii kacay.

Si kastaba ha ahaate, caqabaduhu weli waa kuwa jira. Maaraynta dhaqaalaha guud, dakhli uruurinta,
iyo fulinta shuruucda muhiimka u ah oo ay xeer-dejintu ansixiyeen waa kuwa weli u baahan taagerid
iyo feejignaan joogta ah. Ganacsigu, waa mid kobcaya wuxuuna tiir dhexaad u noqday waxyaabaha ay
Soomaalidu aad u hadal hayso, haddii ay dawladdu ku guul-daraysato inay fuliso baahida guud ee laga
mamaarmanka u ah ganacsiga gaarka loo leeyahay, waxaa durbadiiba xadidmaya kobacii inuu qof waliba
u helo fursad uu ku guulaysan karo, taaso ah saldhiga maalgaashiga.

Muuqaalada taxanaha ee warbixinta dhaqaalaha Soomaaliya waxay si gaara diirada u saaraysaa
nidaamka maaliyadeed ee federaalka. Waa waqtigii ay Soomaalidu si habaysan oo farsamo ku dhisan
u qaban lahayd doodo la xiriira nooca dhaqaale iyo xiriirada maaliyadeed ee Soomaaliya ka dhaxayn
kara. Gunaanadkii, tani waa dhaqaalaha oo la wadaago. Sida dal walba, Soomaaliya waxaa ka jira isu
dheelitir la’aan u dhaxaysa xaga khayraadka dadka iyo Goboladaba. Ka jawaabida isu dheelitir-la’aantani
waxay aasaaska u dhigaysa horumarka mustaqbalka fog. Waxaan idin rajaynayaa inaad qoraalkan ka
heli doontaan waxyaabo muhiim ah, Isla mar ahaantaana annaga oo joogtayn doona xiriirka Bangiga
Adduunka iyo Soomaaliya ka dhexeeya.

                                                                           October 2 0 1 5 | Edition No. 1   v
                             MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
Somalis face a daunting development challenge to overcome the legacy of two decades of sustained conflict and
fragility—but substantial progress is now being made. The new government inherited a dysfunctional economy
facing high levels of poverty and inequality, a youth bulge, high unemployment, and large infrastructure gaps. The
Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) has embarked on a process of structural, legislative, and institutional reform.
The economy is starting to respond: Somalis are returning from abroad to invest, shops are opening, and the property
market is booming. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank estimate Somalia’s GDP at about $5.7
billion in current dollar terms in 2014.

Somalia’s vibrant private sector may reach the limits of its potential if further reforms to the enabling environment,
particularly to security and access to finance, are not pursued. Throughout the years of conflict and fragility, Somalia’s
private sector helped maintain economic activity. However, in the absence of appropriate sector regulation, the
emergence of monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior may be discouraging new businesses from entering the market
and small and medium-size business from growing.

The de facto intergovernmental fiscal arrangements that are emerging as interim state administrations are formed
will affect what is politically possible to negotiate as part of the constitution-making process. In particular, state
administrations are occupying most available tax bases, limiting the scope for the federal government to play its proper
role in redistribution. It will be challenging for states to give away these revenue bases unless they also hand over cost
responsibilities. For its part, the federal government is not in a fiscal position to accept the handover of functions to the
federal level, unless it also gains control over more revenue bases to pay for them.

Inequitable distribution of resources was a fundamental cause of conflict in Somalia; it must be addressed in the
design of the new arrangements. The distribution of the main revenue bases—in particular, customs revenue—is
likely to be creating inequality across states. Addressing inequality requires that poorer states receive transfers, either
from the central government (provided it has sufficient revenues to do so) or from other states that are better off. The
design of intergovernmental fiscal arrangements for Somalia must address this challenge. In the absence of a solution,
it seems likely that states will erect domestic customs barriers, which will undermine growth of Somalia’s small and
fragile economy.

                                     Enhancing growth and macroeconomic stability
The rehabilitation of public institutions that can generate public goods and services will be an enabler of long-term
economic development, but it will rely on increasing the state’s fiscal capacity. Meeting Somalia’ssocioeconomic
challenges is difficult, given the legacy of weak institutions and regulatory frameworks, weak governance, and limited
public services delivery. The reform of public institutions takes 20 years even in the fastest-reforming countries. The FGS
and subnational governments are prioritizing the establishment of credible public finance institutions for macro-fiscal
management. Revenue mobilization of additional business turnover taxes is a critical priority if the state is to increase
its fiscal capacity and extend services to the population. In parallel, the authorities are trying to attract new talent into
reformed civil service institutions at the federal and subfederal levels, in line with fiscal space.

Improving human and economic development outcomes is central if Somalia is to sustain its transition from conflict
to stability. With estimated per capita GDP of $435 in 2013, Somalia is the fifth poorest country in the world, reflecting
two decades of conflict.During this time, physical infrastructure was destroyed or not maintained, and two generations
of Somalis went without education. Only 42 percent of school-age children are estimated to be enrolled in primary
school, of which just 36 percent are girls. Youth are disproportionately affected by poverty and unemployment and
areprey to recruitment into militia or radicalized groups.About 67 percent of 14- to 29-year-olds are believed to be
unemployed. More spending to the social sectors is key to addressing these major developmental challenges.

                                 Developing intergovernmental fiscal arrangements
Somalia’s new fiscal arrangements should be designed to (a) work as a coherent system, preserving a strong common
economic space across the country, and (b) provide scope to address inequities across regions.These objectives
reinforce each other. If states without access to strong revenue bases are supported through transfers, they will be less
likely to look for economically harmful ways to raise revenue. As political bargains are struck, efforts should be made to
achieve balance between functional responsibilities and the availability of revenue to fund them.

Somali stakeholders should be prepared to develop a sustainable fiscal bargain incrementally, renegotiating as fiscal
circumstances and the interests of states and federal government change over time. It may not be possible to reacha
permanent fiscal bargain immediately. The focus now should be on developing robust intergovernmental institutions to
facilitate ongoing negotiation and negotiating a way forward rather than finding a final fiscal arrangement.

Soomaali waxay wajahaysa caqabado ba’an si horumar u gaadho uguna guulaysato raadadki ay ku reebeen
nuglaanshaha iyo colaadii ay labaatankii sanno ee la soo dhaafay- laakiin waxaa hadda la sameeyey horumar la
taaban karo. Dawladan cusub waxay dhaxashay dhaqaale aan shaqayn oo ay soo wajahday saboolnimo iyo sinnaan
la’aan heerarkoodu sarreeyo, da’yartii oo badatay, shaqo la’aan baahsan, iyo dayac balaaran o ku dhacay kaabayaashi
dhaqaalaha. Dawaladda Federaalka Soomaaliya (DFS) waxay dardar gelisay hannaanka geedi-socodka ee qaab-
dhismeedka, shuruucda, iyo dib u habaynta hay’adaha dawliga ah. Dhaqaalihi wuxu bilaabay ka soo kabasho: Somaalidi
waxay ka soo laabteen dibadihii si ay dalka maalgashi ugu sameeyaan, ganacsigiina wuu xoogaystay, iyo weliba hantidi
ma guurtada ahayd oo qiimaheedui uu sare u kacay. Hay’adaha Lacagaha Adduunka (IMF) iyo Bangiga Adduunka waxay
Soomaaliya ku qiyaaseen wax soo saarkeeda (GDP) $5.7 Bilyan marka loo eego sarifka dollarka ee sanadkii 2014kii.

Kobaca wax soo saarka gaarka loo leeyahay ee Soomaaliyeed wuxuu gaari lahaa meeshiisa ugu sarraysa haddi lagu
samayn laha isbedello xaaladaha u saamaxaya kobocooda, gaar ahaan nabadgelyada iyo helitaanka maaliyadeed,
mana aha kuwo la dabagalay. Tan iyo sanadihi colaada iyo nugaylka lagu jiray, waxaa hawlaha dhaqaalaha gacan ka gaysta
inay sii socdaan ganacsiga ama laamaha gaarka loo leeyahay ee Soomaaliyeed. Si kastaba ha ahaatee, maqnaashaha
hay’adihii sida saxda ah wax u ilaalin lahaa ee waaxdan, waxay dhalisay in suuqyadi ganacsiga cid gaar ah ay u xiran tahay
iyo in suuqyadii ay yeeshaan dabeecad aan tartan ku dhisnayn, waxayna taasi niyad jab ku keenaysa ganacsiyada cusub
ee suuqa ku soo biiri laha iyo in ganacsatadii dhexdhexaadka ahayd uu kobacoodii hakad galo.

Sharciyada xiriir-maaliyadeedka ay yeelanayaan maamul-Goboleedyada hada dhismay, iyo Dawaladda Federaalka
waxay saamayn ku yeelan doonaan suurtogalnimada wada xaajoodka siyaasadeed marka laga hadlayo geedi-socodka
diyaarinta Dastuurka. Gaar ahaan, waxay hadda maamuladani canshuuro ka uruuriyaan dhamaan inta badan goobihi
canshuuraha laga qaadi jiray, taasina waxay xadiday doorkii ay Dawaladda Federaalku wax ku kala qaybin lahayd. Sidoo
kale waxaa caqabad noqonaysa Dawlad Goboleedyadu inay wareejiyaan goobaha saldhiga u ah dakhli ururintooda inta
ay ka helayaan wax u damaanad qaada mas’uuliyada bixinta kharashkooda guud. Sidoo kale, Dawlada Federaalku ma
ogolaan karto inay ku wada wareejiso Dawlad-Goboleedyada nidaamka maaliyadeed ilaa ay iyado mas’uuliyada goobaha
saldhiga u ah canshuur uruurinta la wareegto ka dibna ay dib u qaybiso.

U Sinaan la’aanta khayraadka waa sababta saldhiga u ah colaada Soomaaliya; waana in laga hadlaa marka la
diyaarinayo nidaam cusub. Wax ka qabashada sinaan la’aanta waxay u baahan tahay inuu jiro dakhli ku filan oo ay
qaybin karto ama maamulada kale ee uu dakhligoodu sareeyo. Astaynta xiriir-maaliyadeedka maamulada Soomaaliya
ka dhexeeya waa inuu ku dhiirada wax ka qabashada caqabadahan. Haddaan la samayn xal waxay u ekaanaysa in
maamuuladu ay samaystaan gidaarro ay kastamadooda ku ilaashadaan.

Dib u habaynta hay’adaha dawlada iyo dayac-tirka kaabayaasha dhaqaale waxay wax ka tarayaan horumarinta
dhaqaale ee mustaqbalka fog, laakiin taas waxay ku xiran tahay sida ay dawladu karti ugu yeelato kobcinta
dakhligeeda guud. Wax ka qabashada caqabadaha ku xeeran nidaamka dhaqan dhaqaale ee Soomaaliya waa mid adag,
iyado laga eegayo liidaashada hay’adaha dawliga iyo nidaamka wax lagu ilaaliyo, maaumul xumo iyo adeega bulsho
oo xadidan. In dib loo habeeyo dawligu waxay qadataa 20 sano xita dalalka ay dib u habayntooda hawli ku socoto.
Dawlada Federaalka iyo maamul-goboleedyada waxay ku hawlan yihin dhisida hay’adoodihi maaliyadeed oo hufan si ay
u maareeyan miisaanyidahooda. Dakhli uruurinta oo canshuuraha logu kordhiyo ganacsatada waa mid ku adag dawlada
si ay u kordhiso miisaaniyadeeda iyadoo mudnaanta siinaysa adeega bulsho. Sido kale, waxay maamuladu isku dayayaan
in soo jiitaan soomalida aqoonta u leh inay dib u habayn ku sameeyaan Hay’adaha shaqaalaha rayidka min heer federal

        Somaliland’s claim to independence from Somalia has not been recognized. The territory therefore remains legally a region of Somalia. Under the New Deal
        Compact for Somalia, the international community agreed to a “Special Arrangement for Somaliland,” recognizing its special circumstances. Political talks
        between Somalia and Somaliland are ongoing.

        The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States was agreed to at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, the Republic of Korea, in 2011. It
        is an agreement between fragile and conflict-affected states, international development partners, and civil society to improve current development policy and
        practice in fragile states.

     The Somalia High Frequency Survey is highly innovative. It leverages private sector know-how and open-source applications to collect high-quality data under
     difficult field conditions. In fragile states and areas beset by conflict and insecurity, safety and risk considerations limit the time available for face-to-face
     interviews. These concerns make it difficult to supervise the quality of data collection in the field and prevent administering detailed household consumption
     recall modules and using traditional poverty and inequality measurement methods. The Somalia High Frequency Survey embodies a number of innovations to
     overcome these constraints. It provides the authorities with a new approach to collect the data required to estimate a reliable poverty profile of the population
     in such a context.

     The CBS is focusing on registration. Under the regulations, licensing demands a higher standard to be met by the applicant and more information disclosures
     to test the fitness and propriety of owners, partners, directors, and officers. Others measures include mandatory requirements to have an in-house Anti–
     Money Laundering (AML) program with training and an AML officer. AML also requires validation and verification of the information and statements made by
     applicants. Under these regulations, the CBS is also required to review risk and risk-management elements and to modulate the level of sophistication needed
     on an institution-by-institution basis commensurate with the level of risk. The review process under the registration regulation is limited to CBS officials
     checking the content of information in order to confirm the completeness of applications.

     Box 3.1: How is “derisking”affecting Somalia?
 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines derisking as “the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating
 or restricting business relationships with clients or categories of clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk.” Banks
 in Australia,the United Kingdom,and the United States, among others,have closed the accounts of money transfer
 operators because of perceived legal and regulatory problems, sanctions, and anti–money laundering/combating the
 financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risks.

 Account closures have caused changes in how the market works in the United Kingdom and the United States, but
 anecdotal evidence collected by the World Bank and data from Remittance Prices Worldwide indicate that costs to
 consumers have not changed significantly. Costs could rise if competition in the remittance market in Somalia falls
 substantially.

 The British government, in conjunction with the World Bank, is developing the Safer Corridor Initiative. This effort aims
 to tackle key deficiencies in the UK-Somalia remittance corridor until a sounder financial system is in place in Somalia
 and to accelerate and support the development of that financial system. Any measures to improve transparency and
 compliance will involve taking actions at the first mile (the United Kingdom), second mile (the United Arab Emirates),
 and third mile (Somalia). Third-mile measures will be the most difficult to implement, because Somalia’s financial sector
 has not developed in a formal way and the country remains extremely isolated from the global financial infrastructure.

 In 2014 the FGS took measures to formalize Somalia’s financial sector. The CBS licensed and registered six banks and nine
 MTBs and registered nine MTBs under the registration and licensing regulations passed by the CBSin 2014, developed
 with the support of the World Bank. Somalia does not yet have a system in place for knowing your client (KYC) or
 customer due diligence (CDD) requirements. Some money transmitters are considering using biometric identification
 to meet KYC requirements.

 The FATF recommends the application of a risk-based approach to address AML/CFT risks. This approach allows
 countries and financial institutions to apply simplified AML/CFT measures when risks are assessed to be low. However,
 major financial institutions are currently operating in a risk-averse environment. Given the complexities of this corridor,
 they seem unwilling to try to mitigate the risks associated with servicing these money transfer operators.

Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations in Somalia: Challenges and
           Lessons from International Experience
     This Special Focus highlights international experience—and theory drawn from that experience—and
     analyzes what it means for Somalia given the fiscal architecture that is emerging. It comprises five section.
     Section 6 provides a brief overview of key principles drawn from the analysis that follows. Section 7 overviews
     progress in forming the federal state of Somalia. It reviews the history of unitary democracy, centralized
     dictatorship, and state collapse and examines the emergence of a nascent federal system. Section 8 presents
     a framework for thinking about the design of intergovernmental financing arrangements. It reviews the
     de facto intergovernmental financing arrangements that are being established as FMSs are forming and
     examines how they are likely to affect the development of durable intergovernmental fiscal arrangements
     as the constitution-making process unfolds. The section concludes with observations that it may be more
     realistic to expect fiscal arrangements to evolve over time, as fiscal conditions change and as trust develops
     between the stakeholders Section 9 considers the institutional requirements of a well-functioning federal
     system, particularly in relation to the negotiation and operation of intergovernmental relations. It suggests
     next steps for collecting information and conducting analysis that will inform a well-considered process of
     designing the intergovernmental fiscal system.

       The constitution-making process has not sought to engage with Somaliland, which asserts its own independence. It is not anticipated that Somaliland will be
       part of the federal state in the near future. Accordingly, the discussion which follows covers those entities that are considered to be bound by the provisional
       constitution.

6. Key Principles Governing Intergovernmental Relations



         Box 6.1: What Is a federal system?
     According to the Forum of Federations (a global network of federalism and devolved governance) federalism is:
       essentially a system of voluntary self-rule and shared rule. This is implied in the derivation of the word federal, which
       comes from the Latin foedus, meaning covenant. A covenant signifies a binding partnership among co-equals in
       which the parties to the covenant retain their individual identity and integrity while creating a new entity that has its
       own integrity or entity as well. A covenant also signifies a morally binding commitment in which the partners behave
       toward each other in accord with the spirit of the law rather than merely the letter of the law. A covenant is more
       than a contract; it commits the parties to an enduring, even perpetual, relationship and to an obligation to achieve
       the ends of the agreement and to resolve peacefully the conflicts that invariably arise in every relationship.
     Federalism is thus “both a structure and a process of governance that establishes unity on the basis of consent while
     preserving diversity by constitutionally uniting separate political communities into a limited, but encompassing, polity.”

        The fragility of the current system of government is evidenced by the fact that the Puntland Government has announced the severing of its relationship with
        the FGS twice since 2012, resulting in a parallel political process to resolve disputes. Similarly, only months after the interim Southwest administration was
        formed, it set up customs posts between the Benadir region and the new state. The action resulted in a dispute between the Benadir region, the interim
        Southwest, and the FGS. Early in 2015, the Federal Parliament voted to disapprove the composition of the newly constituted Interim Jubba Administration
        (IJA). In response, the IJA announced that it would sever its ties with the FGS. The Interim Administration of South West State (ISWA) also took issue with the
        composition of the IJA regional assembly. Frictions have also arisen between Puntland and the FGS over the formation of the Galmudug Interim Administration.
        Such examples highlight the need for mechanisms to resolve government to government disputes.

        Article 54 of the Provincial Constitution grants the Federal Government powers over foreign affairs, national defence, immigration and citizenship, and
        monetary policy. All other powers are to be negotiated by the Federal Government and FMSs.

     Box 7.1: Constitutional provisions chart the gradual emergence of a federal state
 1960 Constitution:
 Article 1: The Republic
 Somalia is an independent and fully sovereign State. It is a representative, democratic, and unitary Republic. The Somali
 people is one and indivisible.
 2004 Transitional Federal Charter:
 Article 1: Establishment of the Transitional Federal Government
 There shall be a Transitional Federal Government of the Somali Republic based on the sovereign will of the Somali
 people.

 Article 11:
 The Transitional Federal Government of the Somali Republic shall have a decentralized system of administration based
 on federalism.

 Article 1, Section 1
 Somalia is a federal, sovereign, and democratic republic founded on inclusive representation of the people and a
 multiparty system and social justice.

     A confederation is an association of independent sovereign units that join together for certain purposes. The federal level of government is often nominated
     by the members of the confederation, rather than directly elected. United Arab Emirates and Bosnia and Herzegovina are examples of confederal systems.
     Consociational power sharing involves non-territorial power sharing among all the important communities within a state, regardless of where they live. State
     institutions are designed to accommodate proportional representation of these communities, and veto power for minorities. Executive institutions like the
     cabinet are designed to ensure representation of all groups. Within this framework, the individual communities are self-government. Belgium and Lebanon
     are two examples of consociational government. The fourth model proposed by the report was a unitary decentralized democracy.

      Article 142 of the Constitution on Existing Federal Member States in Somalia includes a provision that “(1) Until such time that all the Federal Member States

      States existing prior to the provisional adoption of this Provisional Constitution by a National Constituent Assembly shall retain and exercise powers endowed
      by their own State Constitution.” In theory, the provisions of the Constitution on preexisting states also apply to Somaliland, but in practice this is not relevant
      since Somaliland does not consider itself part of the federal state system.
 	
21
      Somaliland also claims Sool, Sanaag, and Ayn (part of Togdheer).
 	
22
      Following the agreement, the process of forming a viable state has been ongoing; the final step of constituting a parliament was completed in May 2015,
      although a reconciliation process to bring along unhappy clans still needs to continue.
 	
23
      Somaliland is not part of the state-formation process, as it does not consider itself part of Somalia. However, separate tentative discussions of the status of
      Somaliland and its future as a separate state or part of Somalia are underway.

     Ethiopia divides taxes based on the nature of the taxpayer. Because the private sector is relatively small, much of its tax revenues come from taxing public
     servants and publicly owned enterprises. Federal public servants and companies pay tax to the federal government, while taxes on state employees and
     companies go to state governments.

      Box 8.2: Chile and Germany have fraternal intergovernmental transfer systems
 In fraternal intergovernmental transfer systems, better-off subnational governments share resources with governments
 that are less well-off. Fraternal systems are supposed to promote national unity, because citizens whose governments
 receive transfers can see that citizens from other regions have given something up to help them. They can be difficult
 to enforce, however, and in the situations described below the inter-regional transfers are enforced through strong
 discipline from central government.

 Chile’s Municipal Common Fund
 Municipalities are the third level of decentralized government in Chile. Because of the tax bases assigned to them,
 they have more fiscal autonomy than provinces. There is a wide disparity between rich and poor municipalities. Three-
 quarters of municipalities rely on transfers for more than 80 percent of their revenue.

 To reduce disparities, the government created a system in which municipalities contribute 60 percent of their property
 taxes (65 percent in the four richest municipalities) and 50 percent of their vehicle taxes (most of which come from the
 wealthier municipalities) to the Fondo Común Municipal (Municipal Common Fund). The four wealthiest municipalities
 also contribute a proportion of the commercial taxes they raise. The proceeds of the fund are distributed according to
 a formula that is based on equal shares, poverty, tax-exempt land in the municipal area, and per capita revenues from
 other sources.

 Germany’s Solidarity Pacts
 Following the reunification of East and West Germany, the six newly incorporated states in eastern Germany had
 significantly lower revenue-raising capacity than western Germany. Because Germany’s constitution mandates the
 sharing of taxes, there was limited capacity to address this inequality through top-down fiscal transfers. Instead, the
 presidents of the states (lander) and the federal government agreed on a “solidarity pact.”

 The first pact was negotiated in 1995; the second came into force in 2005. Both pacts provide for states with the
 greatest fiscal capacity to share some of their revenue from tax sharing with the poorer states. The states contribute
 to the equalization pool on a graduated scale, with states most above the national average contributing the most. The
 federal government also contributes to the fiscal equalization pool and provides support to the economies of poorer
 states in a variety of ways.

      Since natural resources are often located in remove regions, derivation-based sharing of natural resource revenues may have immediate appeal as a way of
      compensating for the economic disadvantage otherwise experienced by that region. International experience, for example in Indonesia (Papua and West
      Papua) and Papua New Guinea (Southern Highlands) is that these regions end up with far more discretionary resources than the rest of the country, but much
      less capacity to spend it effectively.

Constitution provided for the transfer of customs             8.3). Today Australia is one of the most fiscally
and excise powers to the federal government,                  centralized federal countries.

     Box 8.3: Australia’s fiscal architecture has evolved
The formation of the federal Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 brought together six previously self-governing
colonies, each with its own fiscal arrangements. The Constitution, negotiated over a decade leading up to federation,
was fundamentally a bargain struck by the six constituent units. Retaining state autonomy was an important goal of the
negotiations. Accordingly, the powers of the federal government were limited, and states were given residual powers.

The most important revenue sources for the colonies at federation were customs and excise duties. The six colonies
had operated as independent economic units, taxing the movement of one another’s goods across their borders. As in
Somalia, each state levied customs duty at different rates, taxing the taxed movement of goods across state borders.
One aim of federation was to form an economic union. State perspectives on economic union varied considerably,
however, with some states promoting free trade and others wanting to protect their local industries. Two colonies had
begun diversifying their revenue base by imposing land and income taxes; other, less developed states were unable to
do so, because their populations were itinerant. Underdeveloped states were consequently more reliant on customs
revenue. Because the fiscal circumstances of the states varied greatly, the fiscal provisions of the Constitution proved
very difficult to negotiate.

The final constitutional settlement gave the federal government exclusive control over the most important tax
base but subject to revenue sharing with states. Customs and excise duties were transferred to the Commonwealth
government as exclusively federal taxes, with a uniform tariff to be imposed within two years. The federal government
was also given four key spending responsibilities: defense, foreign affairs, pensions, and post and telecommunications. It
proved very difficult to accommodate the very different fiscal circumstances of each state, because tariff harmonization
affected each of them differently. In the end, it was agreed that Western Australia could continue to levy duties on
goods from other states on a diminishing basis for a period of five years, as the redistribution effected by the uniform
tariff took effect.

The question of how to distribute the surplus customs revenue back to the states proved the most difficult to
negotiate. In the end, the Constitution included a temporary solution, known as the Braddon clause. For a period of
10 years, the Commonwealth was permitted to use one-quarter of customs revenue for its own expenditure needs.
Surplus revenues from customs duty would be returned to the states. Until uniform tariffs were imposed, each state’s
“share” of customs duties was calculated based on how much revenue had been raised in that state; for a period of five
years following the imposition of uniform duties, duties accrued to the state in which the goods were consumed. For
the purpose of calculating the surplus, Commonwealth expenditures were charged against states on a per capita basis.
It was envisaged that return of the surplus on a derivation basis would give way to a system of federal transfers to the
states, which the Commonwealth Parliament would legislate once the Braddon clause expired.

Australia’s fiscal architecture changed radically after federation, in ways that the constitutional architects had not
envisaged. What was essentially a derivation-based system in which states received the surplus generated in that state,
gradually gave way to a system of intergovernmental transfers based on need. The federal government, which had
started at federation with only customs and excise revenue, gradually assumed other tax bases. A federal income tax
was introduced to finance participation in World War I. Later the federal government made access to intergovernmental
transfers conditional on states not imposing state income taxes, effectively crowding states out of this tax base. Over
the first 100 years of federation, Australia went from having a highly decentralized tax and transfer system to having one
of the most fiscally centralized federal systems in the world.

central government at the start. Fiscal integration

     Box 8.4: Bosnia and Herzegovina gradually achieved fiscal integration through tax reform
 Following the comprehensive peace agreement initiated at Dayton Ohio in 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina was
 established as a single sovereign state made up of two entities: the Serb Republic, including about 60 municipalities,
 and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new country had two subnational tiers, consisting of 10 cantons
 and about 80 municipalities.

 The design of the fiscal architecture drew on the fiscal legacy of Yugoslavia, in which most revenues were raised and
 retained by the republics, which then made bottom-up transfers to fund the federal government. This arrangement
 created considerable budgetary vulnerability at the federal government level, because its functioning was dependent
 on transfers from the better-off republics.

 The accord reached in Dayton gave the sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina limited responsibilities—for foreign
 affairs, trade, and immigration; customs policy; monetary policy; and regulation of communications, transport, and law
 enforcement (but not defense). All powers not allocated to the federal government, including the right to raise an army,
 were reserved to the entities. The federal government was provided with no independent tax sources. For more than
 10 years, its activities were financed entirely from transfers from the entities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 provided two-thirds of the federal budget, and the Serb Republic provided one-third. Indirect taxes accounted for
 about 70 percent of all revenues in both entities; they were owned by the entity where they were raised, with shares
 to canton and municipal level in the case of sales tax. Cantons and municipalities were heavily dependent on sales tax
 revenue, which accounted for 70 percent of cantonal revenue in the federation and 50 percent of municipal revenue in
 the republic. Distribution on the basis of origin generated substantial interregional inequity.

 With support from international actors, the two entities reached agreement on the harmonization of indirect taxes.
 A harmonized customs law was adopted in 1998, followed by harmonized excise taxes in 2000 and sales tax in 2001.
 Integration of tax administration proved more difficult, partly because of a policy in the federation to share all sales tax
 revenues with the canton level.

 Agreement on the introduction of a VAT was finally reached in the mid-2000s and implemented on 1 January 2006. It
 was agreed to establish a state-level Indirect Tax Authority and pool all taxes in a single account. The single account
 provided state government for the first time with a revenue source to supports it functions. It was first applied to fund
 the state budget and service Bosnia and Herzegovina’s debt, with the balance shared between the entities. Because
 of the difficulty in attributing VAT revenue to a particularly location, a new basis for distributing the balance had to
 be found. The parties agreed to share VAT revenue on the basis of a formula that guaranteed the respective shares
 of entity, cantons, and municipalities within the federation and of the entity and the municipalities within the Serb
 Republic. To ensure support for the changes, municipalities were given at least as much revenue as they had received
 from the sales tax, with the new formula phased in over six years.

 The introduction of VAT not only succeeded in introducing a single national tax administration system and giving the
 national government a revenue stream to support its functions, it also increased interregional equity. Disparities in per
 capital income at the cantonal level fell from 4: 1 to 2: 1, and municipal-level differences fell from 200: 1 to 35: 1.

     Box 9.1: Three types of institutions can support dynamic and responsive intergovernmental fiscal relations
Finance Commissions
A number of countries have formal (often constitutional) finance commissions that provide advice on revenue-
sharing arrangements. In some cases they advise on the overall division of resources among levels of government;
in other cases their mandate is confined to advising on sharing among levels of government. They help take the heat
from political debates about resource sharing, particularly if they provide a technically expert and credible evidence
base to inform these decisions. Three key policy choices must be made in designing these commissions: (a) whether
membership is technical (as in Australia, India, and South Africa) or political (as in Nigeria and Pakistan); (b) whether the
body sits on a permanent basis (as in Australia, Kenya, and South Africa) or periodically (as in India); and (c) whether the
commission’s mandate is limited to horizontal sharing between states (as in Australia and Nigeria) or extends to sharing
between levels as well (as in Kenya and South Africa).

Upper Houses of Parliament
Upper houses can function as forums for intergovernmental relations. Their impact depends on how they are
constituted. In South Africa, the Council of Provinces is made up of the premiers of the provinces, who provide a direct
voice for state governments in the national Parliament. In Australia and Kenya, senators are elected by the voters of the
state. Because they are elected separately from the state government, rather than being chosen by them, they do not
necessarily represent the interests of the state government; sometimes they are actively in competition with it. They
do however represent the interests of voters in their state. Composition of the upper house will depend on whether it
is intended to represent state governments or the citizens who reside in states. If these houses have intergovernmental
relations functions, they usually have limited mandates, related to vetoing legislation affecting states; they may have
no powers with respect to the budget or exclusively federal concerns. Somalia’s Provisional Constitution provides for an
upper house with 54 directly elected members representing the FMSs and an equal numbers of senators based on the
18 regions that existed before 1991 (Article 72).

Dispute Resolution Bodies
Dispute-resolution institutions include constitutional courts and other mechanisms. The court is almost always the
final arbiter of constitutional disputes, including disputesrelating to financial provisions, although its jurisdiction is
sometimes limited. In South Africa, parties are required to exhaust other options before resorting to courts. In Papua
New Guinea, interpretation of certain constitutional provisions is non-justiciable (meaning they cannot be challenged
in court) or justiciable only at the instigation of one or other government, not private individuals. Somalia’s Provisional
Constitution establishes a constitutional court consisting of five judges, nominated by the Judicial Services Commission
and approved by the lower house of Parliament (Article 109B).

         with a Special Focus on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations

trade, money transfer services, transport and telecommunications, funded by remittances
from the diaspora. The IMF and the World Bank estimate Somalia’s GDP at around US$5.7
billion in current dollar terms in 2014. This puts Somalia’s GDP per capita at US$435 making it
the 5th poorest country in the world.

The Federal Government of Somalia is faced with a daunting task of creating a peaceful and
secure environment, building strong institutions of governance, and delivering key public
services to a weary population after decades of war. These challenges can only be overcome
if the FGS takes a leading role to sustain economic reconstruction by creating a stable
macroeconomic environment that would underpin rapid economic growth, job creation, and
poverty reduction. This can only happen when the Federal government has the resources from
both the public and donors.

The special focus of this Update examines intergovernmental ﬁscal relations in Somalia and
highlights the challenges and lessons drawn from theory and international experience to
provide an analysis of what this means for Somalia given the de facto architecture of ﬁscal
arrangements that is currently emerging. One of the recommendation from this work is that
Somalia’s new ﬁscal arrangements should be designed to work as a coherent system,
preserving a strong common economic space across the country, and provide scope to
address inequities between regions. As political bargains are struck, regard should be given to
the balance between functional responsibilities, and the availability of revenue to fund them.
Another recommendation is that Somali stakeholders should be prepared to develop a
sustainable ﬁscal bargain incrementally, renegotiating as ﬁscal circumstances and the
interests of states and federal government change over time. It may not be possible to ﬁnd a
permanent ﬁscal bargain immediately. The focus now should be developing robust
intergovernmental institutions to facilitate ongoing negotiation, and on negotiating a way
forward rather than a ﬁnal ﬁscal arrangement.
