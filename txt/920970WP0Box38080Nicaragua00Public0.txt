THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bott om of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

      A project approval is a decision stating that the project conforms to the

      the approval is NIO 3.00 per sq. m., and payment can be made either in
      cash or in two equal installments. The required documents are three

      Indoor electrical layout drawings must be reviewed and be found to

      Request and obtain building permit from the Municipality of
      Managua

      The building permit authorizes the start of construction.

      The cost of a building permit includes a tax of 1.1% of the total market
      value of the construction. This tax must be paid in full at the start of
      construction work.

      Buildings are also subject to an inspection fee, as follows:
      -NIO 2.00 per sq. m. for areas from 101 to 200 sq. m.
      -NIO 3.00 per sq. m. for areas from 201 to 1,000 sq. m.
      -NIO 4.00 per sq. m. for areas from 1,001 sq m and above
      (in the case considered here, NIO 4.00 x 1,300.6 = NIO 5202.4).

      Therefore, 1.1%* warehouse value + 4 * sq m. = NIO 29,648.4

8     The required documents are a project approval, an annual real estate          20 days      NIO 29,648
      tax (solvencia de bienes inmuebles), the registration number with ALMA
      (the business registration), a tax clearance certificate (solvencia
      municipal) for the project owner and builder, a builder’s license granted
      by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (Ministerio de
      Transporte e Infraestructura, MTI), the builder's signature on the
      construction plans, bank guarantees, and official payment receipts. The
      building permit carries the same weight as a public deed.

      Inspections may occur during construction. However, these are rare due
      to a shortage of inspectors. Even if an inspection is carried out, the
      inspector would simply verify that the building permit is valid.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
