THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or i f a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      (DCCI)

      To obtain the Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate,
      the LLC must submit the following original documents to the
      Commercial Registry at the DED Trade License and Commercial
      Registration Department. These documents can also be submitted
      online due to the ongoing efforts by DED to render electronic
      registration available and convenient.
      - The prescribed application form, signed by the company manager(s)
      or their legal representative(s).
      - The memorandum of association (an original and a copy).
      - A letter issued by the DED, attesting to the company name approval.
      - The original letter of company approval, issued by the DED
      Committee of Limited Liability Companies.
      - Passport copy of each partner.

      If Commercial Registry officials deem the documentation to be in order,
      the company name will be entered into the Commercial Register. The
      DED then forwards the following documents to the Federal Ministry of
      Economy to arrange for publication:
      - Notarized memorandum of association (copy).
      - The application for entry of the company name in the Commercial
      Register (copy).                                                                         see procedure

      Publication takes several months. However, this time frame is not
      important because the authorities will accept a copy of the Ministry's
      receipt of publication fee payment. After the publication, the Ministry of
      Economy issues its approval letter.

      Before the newly formed company can begin operations, it must apply
      to the DED for a trade license. After the notary public at the Commercial
      Registry notarizes the memorandum of association, a license
      application form is completed in Arabic, signed by the authorized
      company signatory and filed with the DED in duplicate. The DED files
      one copy and forwards the other to the UAE Federal Ministry of
      Economy.
      The trade license application must be filed with the applicable fee and
      the following documents:
      - The prescribed form for setting out the proposed company name in
      Arabic and English.
      - The original lease for the company’s office premises.
      - The prescribed form for obtaining the Dubai Municipality Building
      Department’s clearance on the suitability of the office premises.

      All business activities fall into three categories of licenses: (1)
      commercial licenses, covering all kinds of trading activity; (2)
      professional licenses, covering professions, services, craftsmen, and
      artisans; and (3) industrial licenses, establishing industrial or
      manufacturing activity.

      Upon the conclusion of this procedure, the DED issues the original
      Trade License and Commercial Registration certificates. Upon
      presentation of the receipts showing payment of the Ministry
      publication fee and the Chamber of Commerce membership fee, the
      DED will issue the original trade license and certificate of commercial
      registration for the limited liability company and the DCCI membership.
      Alternatively, the online license application is available whereby the
      applicant submits the filled-in form, completes online payment and
      instantly receives the license certificate which can then be printed out.

      Recently, DED has launched electronic memorandum of association and
      "120-day" hassle-free trade license initiatives. These reforms aim
      towards the transition towards online registration, making it easier to
      start a business.

        Authority (DEWA)

        The customer is required to have their electrical works executed through
        an electrical contracting company. The trade license for carrying out
        electrical works in Dubai is issued to companies by the Department of
        Economic Development, Government of Dubai. The electrical contracting
        company would have electrical engineers and other technical staff
        working under their sponsorship. A private individual/engineer cannot
        obtain such trade license as a consultant company or contracting
        company or execute such works in Dubai. The consultant and
        contracting companies are to be enrolled with DEWA as per above
        criteria to be able to access the on-line services.

        The consultant is then given an account so they can apply online for and
        obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from DEWA, which is a step
        necessary to obtain the building permit. After the electrical consultant or
        contractor has obtained the NOC from DEWA, they will need to submit
        their electrical designs online for approval from DEWA. Based on
        whether the NOC determines the need for a substation, some additional
        approvals might be needed, such as for the substation location, size, and
        layout. For projects requiring a substation to be built within the plot, a
        consulting company will carry out the design works and obtain DEWA
        approval (Design approval) and further shop drawing approvals by the
        electrical contractor. For projects that do not require a substation, the
        electrical contracting company can directly prepare Shop Drawings and
        obtain approval.

      approvals are recorded. The remaining approvals concern the wiring of
      the internal building and at the point of connection with DEWA’s
      network, and as such are not recorded as separate procedures (it is
      assumed the electrician in charge of the internal wiring has already
      obtained these approvals).

      A list of approvals can be found at https://e-services.dewa.gov.ae. The
      approvals do not delay the process because they are obtained as part of
      the completion certificate.

      Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) introduced a 'One
      Window/ One Step Application for Getting Electricity' as the latest
      enhancement to its SAP System that went live in April 2012. The new
      system allows customers to submit their application and track it online. It
      will also allow them to follow the interactions between their electrical
      consultant/ contractor (who acts on their behalf) and the utility [by
      allowing this, customers will be able to track the status of their
      application, which will reduce any delays caused by the contractor].
      Technical site inspection can be scheduled online and no further
      interaction between the customer and the utility is needed. As such, the
      new electronic system will (1) improve the communication between the
      customer and their consultant/ contractor on one hand and the utility on
      the other, and (2) decrease time for processing of applications.

      Customer pays connection fees and obtains external works from
      Dubai Electricity and Water Authority’s contractor

      Processing for CAR permission from the concerned authorities are made
      immediately (by DEWA) after preparation of estimate and without
      waiting for payment. DEWA can prepare a estimate of connection fees
      based on the approved drawings, the comments made in the NOC (the
      remarks indicate whether a substation is needed or not), and its
      Geographical Information System (GIS) that allows it to map the city,
      without the need to go on site.

      The external works are concluded by one of DEWA’s contractors. For 200 25 calendar days     AED 35,000

      Amps, the cable needed would be a 185 mm2 Al, 150 m. long.

      DEWA provides the meter and the cable, but charges only for the cable.
      The fee charged is equal to the cost for DEWA to lay out the cable (i.e.
      price of the cable and labor costs). The customer obtains and installs the
      rest of the material themselves (such as circuit breaker and meter
      cabinet).

      The customer requires executing the electrical works through an

        All works starting from NOC, Drawing approval, application registration,
        and issue of estimate, payment and up to installation of DEWA cable can
        be done in parallel and hence, do not cause delays.

        supply to Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and obtain
        meter installation and final connection

        To request inspection of internal wiring, the electrical contractor has to
        apply online for an LV Inspection & Release of Supply, and can also track
        the status of their application online. The approval can be obtained only
        if the electrician has previously obtained approval of the LV Shop
        Drawing. The application is free of charge. After submitting the online
        application, the electrical contractor will be asked to submit hard copies
        of the drawings, a site plan, and the NOC to the utility.

        The time period for this step varies according to the competency of the
        contracting company. If the full electrical installation is in compliance
        with the regulations and approved drawings, then inspection and final
        supply can be carried out in few days. If a re-inspection is required or
        there is a delay in submission of the building completion certificate, then
        more time would be needed.
