     istorically, geography can influence economic development in many ways. While some
     countries, including a few landlocked countries have benefited from their central location,
     the majority of landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), however, still faces the constraints
imposed by geography and remains on the periphery of major markets. The 32 LLDCs are often
characterized by lower per capita incomes when compared to their transit neighbors and 17 of
them are classified as least developed. Additionally, LLDCs are usually dependent on their transit
neighbors’ markets, infrastructures and institutions.

      andlockedness refers to the geographical situation of a country without direct access to the
      sea (Glassner, 1970). According to this definition, there are 44 landlocked countries in the
      world. Of these, the United Nations lists 32 as landlocked developing countries that are low-
and middle-income countries based on the World Bank country classification (henceforth referred
to as landlocked developing countries, LLDCs) with a population of nearly 440 million.1

      his section provides evidence on connectivity constraints of landlocked developing coun-
      tries. It also provides the evidence on factors explaining differences in logistics performance
      and trade costs between landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and their transit and
coastal neighbors. Despite positive changes with regard to logistics performance and increased
involvement of transit countries, LLDCs still experience considerably higher cost of trade when
compared to the transit coastal countries: a mark-up of about 70 percent in ad-valorem equiva-
lent. Distance alone cannot explain it; it is rather a lack of overall connectivity of international
trade supply chain, related to logistics performance.

      he main obstacles to trade faced by landlocked developing countries involve transiting through
      territories of other countries. These obstacles include: long distances, inadequate transport
      services and infrastructure and inefficient institutional and operational transit regimes. Addi-
tionally, in many locked developing countries, centers of production and consumption are located
more than 800 kilometers (km) away from the closest seaport, which imposes a significant cost and
time penalty on the manufacturers. Moving beyond cost and time parameters, it has been shown
that unreliable hinterland connections have been the greatest impediment faced by manufacturers in
landlocked in their attempt to increase regional trade as well as to enter global value chains (Faye et
al, 2004; Arvis et al, 2011, UNCTAD, 2013). Efficient logistics services and transport operations are
therefore crucial in reducing the effects of remoteness, in particular at modal interfaces, freight ter-
minals, and ports, all of which play a fundamental role in trade of landlocked developing countries.

       Box 4: Exports of Cut Flowers from Kenya and Freshwater Fish from Tanzania

          One of the prime examples of a strong perishables export industry are Kenya’s cut flower exports to the European Union. Over the past forty
          years Kenya has risen to the largest cut flower producer and exporter to the European market, maintaining a solid market share of 31 percent.
          Since inception, air transportation has been the basis for the global distribution of Kenya’s perishable goods. However, Kenya’s national air
          carrier does not have any dedicated freighter aircraft. Nevertheless, the airline transports about 90 percent of the country’s air cargo exports
          in the cargo hold of regular passenger aircraft with destinations in the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Only a small part of the overall
          exports are transported on dedicated cargo aircraft. This fact underscores the importance of passenger air services for air cargo, especially in
          countries which do not possess a large air cargo fleet or whose volume of cargo business is too small to support dedicated cargo operations.
          Another illustrative example of perishables is the export of fresh fish and seafood products. Traditionally, countries with a sea shore have de-
          veloped a fishing industry, providing opportunities for export (Mauritania). However, such countries have often developed their fishing industry
          over centuries, with well-established local distribution networks. Some nations have organized and managed their exports from fisheries by
          traditional means, such as transportation by sea or processing off-shore and freight forwarding by land, and some have assigned fishing
          rights to foreign operators. Air transportation has created a new export market for some landlocked countries or for countries with access to
          large freshwater reservoirs. The production of freshwater fish, such as the West Nile Perch or the Tilapia, has become a very lucrative export
          sector for a few developing countries. A good example is Tanzania, where the West Nile Perch was artificially introduced into the Lake Victoria
          in the 1950s and 1960s. The processing and export industry that arouse out of this freshwater fish production created an export market
          of about US$ 122 million in 2005. The center for Tanzanian fishing operations and processing is the city of Mwanza. According to the City
          Council of Mwanza, the fishing industry of Lake Victoria has created direct employment for over 8,000 local processing workers, and overall
          300,000 indirect jobs. About 52,000 Tanzanian fishermen benefit directly from the Nile perch. The key logistics element for the timely export
          of the processed fish is air transportation. Mwanza disposes of an airport with a 3,300 meter (10’827 feet) long runway, and two non-preci-
          sion instrument approach procedures. This allows the take-off of medium-sized cargo aircraft, which are able to transport the fish products
          directly to destinations for distribution in Europe.

       Source: Bofinger (2007), Gibbs (1984), International Trade Statistics (UNCTAD/WTO).
       Note: About 400’000 kilograms fish pass through Mwanza airport each month. The declared value of the product is US$3.20 per kilogram, and the estimated
       overall cost of transport to final destination as value added to the product is about US$1 per kilogram.

28   Improving Trade and Transport for Landlocked Developing Countries




       Box 5: Open Skies for Armenia

          In early 2013, Armenia decided to implement an “Open Skies” policy, breaking apart from a long legacy of tight regulations in its commercial
          aviation market. The particularity of the Armenian case relies in its historical limited connectivity with international markets, partly determined
          by geography, and partly determined by geopolitical considerations. Besides being landlocked, the country has open land borders with only
          two of its four neighboring countries. Moreover, the size of its Diaspora is several times larger than the number of inhabitants currently resid-
          ing in Armenia. All these factors contribute to create frictions for the free movement of travelers, workers, knowledge and ultimately curtail
          the growth of the Armenian hospitality sector, which accounts for about 20 percent of all goods and services exports.
          For over 20 years—since the country became independent–attempts at setting up a national airline proved unsustainable. After the disband-
          ment of the Soviet Union, Aeroflot’s Armenian Directorate continued to operate under the name of “Armenian Airlines”—a company wholly
          owned by the Armenian State—until the year 2002, when it ceased operations due to insolvency issues. The following year, a joint venture
          between Russian and Armenian private capitals established “Armavia Airline Company”, under an investment agreement signed between the
          parties and the Armenian government. The agreement granted Armavia exclusivity rights for a period of 10 years, to operate on designated
          international routes, and “first refusal” rights on any new routes negotiated in bilateral air service agreements by the Armenian Government.
          During the duration of the contract, Armenia maintained a single designation policy—whereas only one airline per country is allowed to
          operate on every route—except for the case of the Russian Federation. Moreover, traffic rights were set up to match Armavia’s operational
          possibilities, as a way of ensuring a “balanced” share of traffic for the Armenian carrier.
          As a consequence of the restrictive aviation policies applied by the country, the number of flights that foreign airlines could offer was significantly
          constrained, and competition between carriers limited. Different studies carried out by international donors between 2010–2012 estimated that,
          as a result of these policies, inbound and outbound fares per kilometer into and out of Armenia (exclusive of taxes, fees and charges) evidenced
          a premium of 33 to 50 percent, as compared to neighboring Georgia –a country with a fully liberal aviation regime (e.g. Open Skies). During the
          period 2005–2011, passenger traffic growth rates in Georgia doubled those of Armenia after liberalizing its aviation policy.
          After facing a prolonged period of financial distress, Armavia ceased operations in March 2013. The demise of the Armenian carrier brought
          an agitated debate in Armenian policy fora over its aviation policy. The disappearance Armavia seemingly acted as a catalyst for the Govern-
          ment of Armenia to consider the liberalization of its commercial aviation market. In effect, through a series of Government decrees, Armenia
          adopted an Open Skies policy in late 2013. The result is such that any airline wishing to serve the Armenian market can do so (not including
          5th freedoms) without any restriction in the number of frequencies or aircraft size, provided they comply with safety regulations. The Russian
          Federation and UAE were the first to amend the old air service agreements with Armenia. After almost a year, recent passenger traffic growth
          figures indicate that the Armenian market has expanded in 2014 by 25 percent (Jan-June) as compared to 2013, and the number of carriers
          serving Yerevan increased from 27 to 31. New services will also include not only a combination of international legacy carriers and regional
          airlines from the CIS countries, but also low cost carriers; the arrival of the latter will also bring a wider range of services offering, especially

       egional integration and facilitation of trade and transit are at the heart of efforts to reduce
       access costs of LLDCs. While transit cooperation encompasses legal issues, it is rather an
       issue of a proper implementation of transit agreements. With few successes in the past de-
cade, the Vienna Programme of Action offers an opportunity for LLDC countries and development
partners to pay close attention to the issues of transit. While traders in LLDCs, transit countries and
development partners may be confronted with bad infrastructure or long distances to market, the
main sources of higher cost have to do with unreliability of supply chains and delivery of goods.
The main factors behind unreliability depend on the “soft infrastructure of LLDCs”, including the
lack of proper implementation of a transit system, procedural complexity, and, in many cases,
inefficient market for services such as trucking, reviewed in the previous section. Progress did
happen in other areas where some trade facilitation practices, not specific to the needs of LLDCS,
have been widely adopted worldwide such as the use of IT or modern border crossing facilities.
More cross border cooperation is still much needed to fully integrate supply chains regionally and
address one of the key access constraints of the LLDCs.

     Note: Transit trade describes the inland movement of goods under customs control that is not cleared by customs. Transit can take place in the country of destination
     and origin of the goods (national transit) or in a third country where the merchandise is carried from an entry post to an exit post (international transit). Hence, a complete
     transit is a sequence of international and national transit links. Landlocked developing countries can trade with non-neighboring countries only through transit systems.

 Box 7: European Transit System

    The European common transit system is the term used here for the European Community and common transit systems—systems that apply
    to goods imported into any of the 27 European Union member states and 4 European Free Trade Association countries from outside that
    area, as well as to exports in the reverse direction. The Community transit system applies to trade between European Union members and
    third countries, while the common transit system (in the more restricted sense) to trade between European Union and European Free Trade
    Association countries under essentially the same rules. The transit manifest is known as T1. Imports are subject to duty in the destination
    country in accordance with the European Union’s common external tariff, and to value added tax (VAT) in accordance with national tax rates.
    The recently implemented New Computerized Transit System (NCTS) has made the European common transit system even friendlier.
    Guarantees can be of three kinds: a cash deposit, guarantee by a guarantor (who vouches for the trader), or a guarantee voucher (a multiple of
    the standard € 7,000) valid for up to one year. For a regular procedure the guarantee must apply specifically to an individual trip. Authorized
    transporters (and other principals) may present comprehensive guarantees valid for multiple trips and longer periods, but covering only the
    total duty expected to be at risk in an average week—the so-called reference amount. The coverage of the comprehensive guarantee or guar-
    antees can be less than 100 percent of the reference amount, and it can even be waived if the principal meets conditions that imply low risk.
    The European common transit system represents a very streamlined evolution of regional carnet system. It is now fully computerized, it does
    not require the soft infrastructure of the TIR (the IRU and national associations), and it allows competition for guarantees. There is also less
    intermediation by brokers. In essence it is like a national transit system, but expanded into an economically integrated region.

 Box 8: Comparison of European transit with the Eurasian CU transit

     For instance, in Kazakhstan, like in other landlocked developing countries, transit may happen under:
     1.	 The TIR
     2.	 The provision of the customs union for instance for goods coming from the CU border to an internal destination within the customs union
         (when they are not cleared at the border), or for export from inside the customs union
     3.	 Special provisions for trucks coming from Khorgos to inland depot in Almaty.
     From the interviews, the application of a concept of transit operators seems to be much more restrictive in the Eurasian CU when compared
     to the EU system, at least in its implementation. In application to Kazakhstan, this concept results in an exclusive class of transport customs
     brokers with a higher level of standing guarantees. Similar to the registration fee of brokers, the guarantee amount is fixed and is not tied to
     the volume of transit as in the EU or a typical transit guarantee system. In fact, the system should be enhanced to include:
     1.	 Comprehensive guarantees issued to most large logistics and trucking companies, especially those operating under the TIRs;
     2.	 Vouchers for occasional operators, which would still have to register with customs. For instance, this could apply to middle-size transport
         companies.
     Furthermore, the transit guarantees should be computerized under the same conditions as the import customs declarations (paperless trade).
     Critical to the system is the ability of the customs office at destination or en route to access the transit declaration initiated at the point of
     entry of the Customs Union. This raises an issue of IT connectivity within the CU, which in current situation is more of a legal/organizational
     issue rather than a technical one.

   n landlocked developing countries, infrastructure is often characterized by insufficient qual-
   ity, poor maintenance, and missing links, so these issues need to be addressed. This chapter
   highlights the importance of cooperation among the LLDCs and coastal countries for planning
and prioritizing investments towards infrastructure in order to ensure proper interconnectivity
and interoperability of services. Investments in infrastructure should seek to maximize the com-
parative advantage of different modes of transportation, with appropriate and efficient movement
of freight from one mode of transport to another. In the long run, maintenance of infrastructure
is crucial for LLDCs to avoid the enormous costs associated with making overdue repairs. This
requires LLDCs to conduct regular maintenance and maintain an upkeep budget for ongoing
repairs and improvements.

     The evidence shows there are several constraints            and avoid missing opportunities from technological
to reducing trade costs for LLDCs, and they are: high            development, prevent incompatibility with import-
