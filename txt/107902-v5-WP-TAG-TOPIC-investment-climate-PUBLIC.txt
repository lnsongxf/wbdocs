    Risk responsibilities
    at national and
    international levels

    As previously discussed in the Module entitled “Leg-
    islative Reform,” the architecture of the food safety
    regulatory system needs to be built upon several key
    elements, three of which are risk focused.

    A food safety regulatory system needs to provide for
    the following:

     •	 Risk assessment. This is the process of identifying
        food safety hazards, assessing likelihood of occur-
        rence and severity, and evaluating the significance.

     •	 Risk management. This is the coordinated and
        economical application of resources to minimize,
        monitor, and control the probability and/or impact
        of food-borne incidents and to maximize the real-
        ization of opportunities to prosper throughout the
        food sector.

     •	 Risk communication. This is the process of ensur-
        ing that the logic, outcomes, significance, and limi-
        tations of the risk assessment are clearly understood
        by all stakeholders.
