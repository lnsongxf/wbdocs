The Promoting Green Urban Development in African Cities, Urban Environmental Profile for eThekwini, South
Africa was prepared by a core study team led by Roland White (Global Lead: City Management, Governance
and Financing - Task Team Leader) and included Chyi-Yun Huang (Urban Specialist) and a consultant team from
AECOM including John Bachmann, Diane Dale, Brian Goldberg, Maritza Pechin and Dr. Jane Turpie (Anchor
Environmental). Dr. Jeffrey Wielgus Yanovich (Consultant/Environmental and Natural Resource Economist) and
Dr. Timm Kroeger (Senior Environmental Economist, The Nature Conservancy) contributed invaluable technical
insights, critical review and guidance. Jonathan Schroeder (AECOM), Robert Pretorius (AECOM) and Chivashni
Bachen (AECOM) provided secondary data collection and research support. Sonia Wheeler offered organizational
and administrative support and Sarah Botta (AECOM) provided graphic design support.

The document was prepared under the overall guidance of Francisco Ferreira (Chief Economist), Sameh Wahba
(Practice Manager), Mukami Kariuki (Practice Manager) and Asad Alam (Country Director).

This Urban Environmental Profile benefited immensely from close collaboration with representatives from
the Government of South Africa, including the eThekwini Municipality Environmental Planning and Climate
Protection Department (EPCPD), the Office of the City Manager, the Development Planning, Environment and
Management Unit, and the Water and Sanitation Unit. The team would like to express its gratitude especially
to Dr. Debra Roberts (EPCPD) for her close involvement and guidance, and to her team represented by Richard
Boon, Joanne Boulle, Natasha Govender and Bheki Mdletshe for their support and important contributions made.
Special thanks are also given to Mr. Adrian Peters (Chief Strategy Office) for his invaluable key insights.

The study would not have been possible without the generous financial contribution of Korean Green Growth
Partnership.

A.	        Geophysical and Economic
           Context
eThekwini or Durban is located on the southeastern coast
of South Africa in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)
(see Figure 1). eThekwini is 229,193 hectares (2297
km2) and is bounded by uTongati River in the north, the
aMahlongwa River to the south, and the Indian Ocean to
the east (EPCPD, 2013c). The eThekwini Municipal Area
(EMA) is characterized by diverse topography, from steep
escarpments in the west to a relatively flat coastal plain in
the east.

Between 2001 and 2011, the population of Durban grew
from 3.09 million to 3.45 million at an average annual
growth rate of 1.13%, as shown in Table 1 (eThekwini
Municipality, 2014a). This growth rate is relatively slower
than other rapidly urbanizing African cities, such as Dar es
Salaam (at an average growth rate of 4 to 5%) (URT 2002,
2012).

Durban’s population is projected to grow at a steady rate
over the next couple of decades. By 2035, the population
is projected to be between 4.1 and 4.5 million as shown
is Figure 2, and under low and high growth scenarios
respectively (eThekwini Housing Sector Unit, 2012,
eThekwini Municipality, 2014a).

Although the unemployment rate is generally high,
eThekwini has shown significant improvement,
decreasing from 31.4% in 2006 to 20.4% in 2011. When
compared to the other metro municipalities in 2011,
only the City of Tshwane performed better achieving
a 13.2% unemployment rate. Despite the decrease in
unemployment, a more representative figure is the
percentage of people employed from 2006 to 2011 as
it includes the effect of workers who left the workforce.
eThekwini still outperformed the other metros with an
employment increase percentage of 3.8% during the five
year period. These gains are essentially not as great as
the reduction of unemployment rates portray (eThekwini
Municipality, 2014a).

A much higher unemployment rate is observed in
informal settlements. Informal settlements exhibit a much
higher average unemployment rate of 43% (The Housing
Development Agency, 2013). The gap between the rich
and the poor is high, with the 2012 Gini coefficient1 for
eThekwini Municipality standing at 0.63, which is the
national average (eThekwini Municipality, 2014a).

Historically, the city has developed in a fragmented
pattern, with higher growth in peri-urban areas.
eThekwini has a multi-nodal spatial development form.
In addition to the central business district (and nearby
inner western suburbs), two other large residential zones
of medium-high density can be observed – to the north

Umlazi) (see Figure 5). On average the density is 4 dwelling
units per hectare (eThekwini Housing Unit, 2012). This
development pattern is partially due to legacy Apartheid
segregation policies, a development and cultural trend
of developing one unit per plot, and development by the
private sector in outer areas where land is more readily
available.

                                        predominate in areas not administered by the eThekwini
                                        Municipality. The encroachment into natural habitats and
                                        conservation areas destabilizes the land and vegetation of
                                        critical catchment areas. This, coupled with the fact that
                                        approximately 67% (209,847 out of 313,958 households)
                                        of informal settlement and rural traditional households

                                        water quality downstream (eThekwini Municipality, 2012a).
                                        Informal settlements are located at the urban edge for
                                        three primary reasons. First, historic Apartheid-era planning
                                        did not allocate land for low-income housing in the urban
                                        core, thereby pushing informal settlements to the urban
                                        fringe (Marx et al, 2003). Second, the combination of a
                                        high demand and high price premium for well-located land
                                        within the urban core means that there is limited space for
                                        low-income settlements. Third, land use regulations within
                                        Ingonyama Trust lands are lenient, thereby encouraging
                                        informal settlements to occur. Areas formally administered
                                        by the eThekwini Municipality occupy approximately 36% of

III.	 QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS
Being a global biodiversity hotspot, eThekwini’s rich
environmental assets are threatened by growth, economic
development and climate change. According to the
Endangered Wildlife Trust, South Africa is the third most
biodiverse country in the world. eThekwini is situated in
the middle of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Region
(shown in Figure 8), an area described by Conservation
International as one of 35 “Biodiversity Hotspots” in
the world. Biodiversity hotspots cover only 2.3% of the
globe, but they support a high proportion of endemic
plant and animal species (Conservation International,
n.d.). eThekwini’s subtropical climate, with warm, humid
summers and mild winters, creates a natural environment
for many endemic plant and animal species to thrive.

The development of natural habitats and conservation land
threatens to permanently change Durban’s environmental
landscape and severely reduce the ecosystem services
that sustain human civilization. As of 2010/2011, only 26%
of eThekwini’s land area was natural and non-degraded
(EPCPD, 2011c). The degradation of natural habitats
reduces the land area for endemic species to live and
flourish. Disruption of upland habitats impacts water
quality and availability of water.

Notes: * The key biodiversity areas (noted in red) were compiled from underlying conservation plans. In addition, priorities within missing areas (especially the coastal
sections of Mozambique, minor areas of the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Limpopo) were filled in using compatible systematic planning methods and/or inclusion of
conservation priorities from national-level conservation plans. * The hotspot boundary is in blue. The protected areas outlined in green extending to the north of the hotspot
are parts of South Africa and Mozambique’s Kruger and Limpopo National Parks that fall outside the hotspot. The outline of these parks is shown on this and other maps in
this document because of the parks’ importance within the context of the two countries’ protected area systems.

eThekwini monitors the size of critical vegetation assets
and sets targets for permanent conservation. For example,
the KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS), classified
as endangered by the South African National Biodiversity
Institute (SANBI), is a significant vegetation asset that once
covered 6% of the eThekwini Municipality Area (EMA),
but approximately 73% has been converted to urban
settlement and agricultural land uses. As of 2009/2010,
only 0.2% of the surviving KZNSS is conserved (EPCPD,
2010b). Figure 13 shows the original land area that KZNSS
once covered as compared with the amount that was
remaining in 2009.

considerable vegetated land available to meet many of the
targets, in practice the statutory protection for many of
these areas is limited.

The degradation of eThekwini’s rivers is increasing.
In 2006, 34% of eThekwini’s rivers were rated in poor
condition, and by 2010 that proportion increased to 40%.
Generally, river condition worsens as a river approaches the
ocean and travels through more developed areas. The 2006
State of the Rivers Report, which includes data samples for
61 sites on 33 different river systems in the EMA, found a
range of water quality and river health issues. Of the 61
sites monitored, 34% were rated in poor condition and
an additional 27% were rated fair (see Table 3) (Ground
Truth, 2006). A 2010 survey of monitoring sites found that
conditions at 40% of the sites were poor and only 3% of the
sites were near natural condition (eThekwini Municipality,
2014a). This data indicates that water quality is continuing
to decline over time in eThekwini.

eThekwini posts a map once a month documenting the
quality of the water of its rivers. Figure 15 shows the
river water quality for October 2014. Although the actual
E.coli counts for each river depicted in Figure 15 is not
disclosed, Table 4 shows the thresholds for the river
quality rating scale. For reference, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) recommends a maximum E. coli
concentration of 410 cfu/100mL as the recreation water
quality standard (U.S. EPA, 2012); therefore all rivers in
Figure 15 that rated poor (yellow designation) or critical
(red designation) are well above EPA’s recommended
thresholds.

                                     poor water quality creates a hostile environment for native flora and fauna.

                                     The uMngeni Estuary’s size has decreased significantly due to extensive filling and canalization. The
                                     estuary suffers from poor water quality attributed to sewage spills, leaks and poorly treated effluent
                                     from sewage treatment facilities, and water discharges from the industrial basin which is
                                     immediately adjacent to the upper estuary. Four upstream dams have significantly reduced the
                                     quantity of freshwater reaching the estuary. The estuary is also over-fished.

                               Discussed in further detail in a later part of this section, Durban Bay was significantly altered to
                               develop the Port of Durban. Extensive infilling and canalization has reduced the habitat and altered
                               the flows of freshwater into the estuary. The bay has poor water quality due to sewage spills,
                               untreated and poorly treated effluent, and the adjacency of the industrial basin. Alien species have
                               been recorded in the bay and endemic species have completely disappeared from the bay.

                               This estuary’s functions are severely compromised due to significant infilling and canalization due to
                               industrial and residential development, high levels of nutrients, reduced freshwater, and chemical
                               contaminations. Low dissolved oxygen levels and regular fish kills suggest significant nutrient loads
                               due to improperly or untreated effluent discharges. System is average biodiversity importance.

                               The eziMdokodweni Estuary is highly degraded due to a major loss of habitat area and nutrient and
                               chemical contamination. Major industrialization in the catchment, infilling, and canalization have led
                               to a loss in the size of the lagoon’s mouth area. Low dissolved oxygen levels and regular fish kills
                               suggest significant nutrient loads due to improperly or untreated effluent discharges and chemical
                               contamination from the industrial basin. The estuary accumulates litter and debris during flash flood
                               conditions.

                               The aManzimtoti Estuary is highly degraded. The estuary’s mid and lower estuarine floodplains are
                               reduced in size due to infilling and canalization. Freshwater levels are low due to extraction for
                               irrigation upstream. Water quality in the estuary is poor due to discharges from drains that terminate
                               in the estuary and high nutrient loads from improperly or untreated effluent that has led to regular
                               fish kills. The invasive plant Tarebia granifera, which can negatively impact benthic communities, has
                               been documented in the estuary.

                               The Little aManzimtoti Estuary is highly degraded due to a loss of flood plain areas. The estuary is
                               possibly receive an excess of freshwater via discharged treated waste water. Water quality is poor
                               due to high nutrient loads from improperly or untreated effluent that has led to regular fish kills.

          iLovu




                               The iLovu Estuary is in fair condition with the loss of floodplain areas. The estuary experiences
                               nutrient inputs from agriculture and upstream untreated effluent. It is under moderate pollution
                               and habitat loss pressure. Freshwater extracted upstream for irrigation has reduced freshwater
                               levels in the estuary. The invasive plant Tarebia granifera has been documented in the estuary.

                While the status of the uMahlongwane Estuary is Good, increasing threats indicate that this estuary
                is on a declining trajectory. The estuary’s floodplains have been filled and drained for sugar
                plantations. The upper estuary is impacted by a waste water treatment plant and increased nutrient
                loads are rising. Freshwater is diverted upstream for irrigating sugar cane. The 2009 Durban Estuary

                While currently classified as in fair condition, the iMahlongwa Estuary is beginning to show the

Health Rating Scale
Excellent = Estuaries with high level of habitat integrity, good water quality, high diversity and high provisioning levels of goods and services
Good = Estuaries with most of the core estuarine habitat and estuarine support habitats still present, good water quality, diversity of habitats
        and species and estuarine processes in place
Fair = Estuaries with core estuarine habitat intact, some estuarine support habitats, impacted water quality and some loss of diversity and key
        estuarine process in place
Poor = Estuaries with impacted core estuarine habitat. Substantially reduced or no estuarine support habitats, polluted water, substantial loss
        of diversity and/or abundance and key estuarine processes impaired
Highly Degraded = Estuaries which have had major impacts on core estuarine habitats through infilling, canalization and pollution, substantially
                    reduced or no estuarine support habitats and major loss of key estuarine processes

development of Durban harbor as well as construction of
the Lower Marine Parade contributed to the interruption
of sand deposition on Durban’s main beaches, driving an
average total loss of 280,000 cubic meters of sand per year
from the main beach front area (eThekwini Municipality,

each year, dredged from the harbor’s breakwaters.

•	 Agricultural Activity Although agricultural activity
   such as sugar cane burning visibly affects the
   environment, it did not have a major impact on the
   air quality indicators such as PM10 and Sulphur
   Dioxide. The sugar cane industry burns 90% of
   its crop at harvest, while 10% is harvested green
   (Dept. of Env Affairs, 2013). Preliminary findings
   from the Air Quality Management Plan Update
   2015 show that biomass burning (e.g. sugar cane)
   accounts for only 1% of PM10 emissions and less

   2015) while accounting for less than 1% of SO2
   emissions (eThekwini Municipality, 2013d).
•	 Durban has implemented air regulations that
   have lowered the concentration of major air
   pollutants below international thresholds; however
   vehicular transportation is a growing source of air
   pollution. The Health Unit has been monitoring the
   concentration of benzene, sulphur dioxide (SO2),
   indoor air pollution, particulate matter (PM10), ozone
   (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO),
   and odors around the eThekwini area for decades.
   The monitoring stations, extending from Isipingo
   in the south to Tongaat in the north and Pinetown
   in the west, are distributed throughout eThekwini
   to gather air pollution from the following sources:
   heavy industries, small to medium industries,
   traffic, and residential areas. The majority of the       Figure 23	 10 Year Annual Average SO2 Trend in South Durban
   stations are located in the South Durban Industrial       Source: eThekwini Health et al, 2007
   Basin, which is a hot spot for various pollutants
   (Dept. of Env. Affairs, 2013). Major pollutants
   and their concentrations are described here:
•	 Benzene and VOC In 2004 and 2005, the benzene
   levels were below the WHO’s threshold value of 10
   µg/m3, but above the WHO’s 2010 target of 5 µg/
   m3 (see Figure 22). The WHO states that no level of
   benzene exposure is safe but has placed target limits
   to help encourage reductions in benzene (eThekwini
   Health et al, 2007). Typical benzene sources are
   industries and vehicles that refine or burn oil. The
   primary source of VOC emissions in eThekwini in
   2004 was from vehicles burning gasoline fuel.

  •	 Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Industrial activities in South
     Durban accounted for more than 96% of SO2
     emissions in 2005. The amount of SO2 emissions
     decreased by 45% from 1997 to 2006, as shown in
     Figure 23 (eThekwini Health et al, 2007). Over this
     period, major polluters installed scrubbers on smoke
     stacks to reduce SO2 emissions. In 2005, the overall
     picture of SO2 exceedances improved, with a 54%
     reduction in the number of 10-minute exceedances
     and a 56% reduction in the number of daily
     exceedances between 2004 and 2005 (eThekwini                           Figure 25	 O3 Monthly Averages (8-hour), 2014 Q1
     Health et al, 2007). This positive trend has continued                 Source: eThekwini Municipality, 2014b
     as the 2014 Quarter 1 Air Quality Report found no
     exceedances during the first three months of the
     year; however no data was collected at Wentworth
     monitoring station due to faulty data analyzers.
     Wentworth (shown in light blue in Figure 24) is
     a site that has historically reported high levels of
     SO2. The data collected from the Southern Works
     monitoring station showed levels of SO2 below the
     24-hour standard (eThekwini Municipality, 2014b).

IV.	 DIRECT DRIVERS AND CAUSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL
     VULNERABILITY AND DEGRADATION

As described in Section III, Durban’s environmental assets                            The increase in eThekwini population living in informal
have been significantly degraded by anthropogenic                                     settlements can be attributed to the continued urbanization
actions. While ancillary drivers certainly exist, this section                        of the region and the slow pace of low-income housing
of the Urban Environmental Profile documents the direct                               supply in Durban. There is a significant demand for low-

vulnerable locations. Over a ten-year period the
proportion of eThekwini households living in informal
settlements has increased despite aggressive municipal
efforts to upgrade settlements during that timeframe.
In 2001, 24.9% (204,812) eThekwini households lived in
informal settlements and in 2011, 27.4% (262,000) of
households lived in informal settlements (The Housing
Development Agency, 2012, 2013).

According to the 2011 Census, a higher proportion of the
population lives in informal settlements in the EMA than
in the rest of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province. An estimated
75% of households living in informal settlements in KZN
live in the eThekwini Metro Area, whereas EMA is home to
only 38% of KZN’s population (The Housing Development
Agency, 2013).2

 It is important to note that the 2011 Census estimates there 111,000 households
in informal settlements in eThekwini; however, the eThekwini Municipality
estimated that there were 262,000 households in informal settlements in 2011. The
extreme discrepancy may be due to the differences in the definitions of an informal
settlement (KZN Informal settlements status, 2013).

Source: eThekwini Municipality, 2013b     Informal settlements, predominantly located at the
                                          urban periphery and upstream of the rest of Durban, are
                                          displacing Durban’s existing environmental assets and
                                          negatively impacting the entire catchment. By locating
                                          on greenfields, the informal settlements replace the
                                          natural vegetated landscape with human development,
                                          greatly reducing or eliminating the ecosystem services
                                          the vegetated landscape provides. Viewing Figure 33 and
                                          Figure 34 side-by-side shows how the location of informal
                                          settlements correlates with the location of eThekwini’s
                                          remaining terrestrial assets. Furthermore, these growing
                                          informal settlements are located upstream of the rest

                                          2012; 2013; Thola, 2015). For example, a detailed study
                                          of the condition of catchments in the Outer West Corridor
                                          found that the natural habitat was significantly degraded
                                          by rural settlements, as well as by agriculture and sand
                                          mining practices. The study found that nutrient loading

While this impact is not considered to pose an immediate
ecological threat, the expansion of the enrichment is a
cause for concern that requires additional management
consideration (CSIR, 2012). Depending on the ocean
currents and amount of sludge discharged into the sea,
this nutrient-rich material can also contribute to estuarine

Durban is facing a major water shortage problem and
has avoided major droughts only because there has
been adequate rainfall (AECOM, 2014). Currently,
water is primarily supplied to Durban via the uMngeni
catchment. However, the Department of Water and
Sanitation anticipates that demand will soon outstrip
supply, and eThekwini will need to import water from
neighboring catchments. However, existing and propsed
land developments that lack adequate watershed
protections within the broader catchments outside of the
EMA boundaries, pose a significant threat to the quality
of Durban’s present and future water supply (personal
communications Fennemore, 2015).


D.	     Development of the Port of
        Durban
While the Port of Durban is a critical economic engine, the
development of the Port has affected the ecology of the
bay. Entire taxonomic animal groups have disappeared
from the bay. The bay’s mangrove habitat has decreased
to 3% of its original land area, and water bird populations
have declined by 70%. The Port of Durban is a significant
economic driver for the City of Durban and a critical asset
for South Africa. In 2008, approximately 6,000 people

key institutional challenges and issues related to these four areas. Finally, the section concludes by
offering some suggestions and recommendations for improvements to policy and decision makers and

Regulatory Environment

Overall
Generally, there is a strong regulatory environment
around urban and urban environment management to
support the mandates of the relevant eThekwini Units
and Departments – in terms of the presence of acts,
regulations, as well as policies, guidelines and strategies.
These occur at the national, provincial and local levels and
can be perceived under two main inter-related areas: urban
development and land use planning; and environmental
planning and management.

D’MOSS
Due to factors such as land ownership (90% of D’MOSS is
individually or communally owned), only around 1.5% of
D’MOSS (June 2015) is formally protected in terms of the
Protected Areas Act and 2% is managed by the municipality.
In particular, due to the inherent nature of D’MOSS – land
with high biodiversity value the largest concentration of
the D’MOSS area falls within rural land under the joint
administration of the ITB and the Municipality.

While eThekwini has considerable institutional capacity

objectives are severely compromised by the limited
capacity to implement and enforce environmental

multiple layers of government involved in the regulation of
the environment that result in limited statutory authority
at the local level. For example, only 12% of the Durban
Metropolitan Open Space System (D’MOSS) was under
formal protection in 2012 despite the role of D’MOSS as
the primary tool for conservation of the municipality’s
environmental assets. Only a small portion of critical
vegetation habitats are statutorily protected as Special
Ratings Areas. D’MOSS is ineffective in preventing or
directing the development activities that impact targeted
conservation areas within the land under traditional

    System (D’MOSS) is an ecosystem management
    program managed by the eThekwini Municipality’s
    Environmental Planning and Climate Protection
    Department (EPCPD). D’MOSS describes a series
    of green open spaces in the Durban metro region
    that provide critical ecosystem services and are
    characterized by high rates of biodiversity. As of
    2012/2013 nearly 75,000 hectares of land are
    included in D’MOSS, which is 33% of the total
    eThekwini municipal land area (EPCPD, 2012/2013).
    As of 2012/2013, only 12% of D’MOSS was formally
    protected and 2% of D’MOSS was managed. The
    EPCPD uses various tools to conserve the land
    within D’MOSS, 90% of which is individually or
    communally owned, and spends approximately R2
    million annually to acquire land within D’MOSS.
