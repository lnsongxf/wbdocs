Improved Communities, Better Cities for Vietnam
Why a guide?
The Government of Vietnam is looking for ways to make Vietnam's cities better places in which poor and \fUlnerable .families can live and work.
Therefore some important questions need answers:
"What can be done to improve the living conditions in Vietnam's cities? What are the special difficulties of helping the poor and
vulnerable groups? How can cities be improved? How can this be accomplished and how much will it cost?"

To help find the answers four consultant teams worked from November 2001 to June 2002 to conduct major studies of urban policies, of cities, and of
poverty in cities. The goal was to understand the problems and discover far-reaching responses: a nation-wide program of actions to alleviate urban
poverty.

    The Difficulties and Possibilities of Housing the Urban Poor
  Why are there sub-standard living areas and housing problems?                              Question: But aren't apartment buildings more
  All developing countries' cities have these types of problems. The                         efficient? High- and mid-rise buildings are often

  have limited national and local spending on cities and towns. City administrators          which these families need to supplement their incomes.
  have not had the money, staff, or experience to handle the growth, and
  particularly the needs of the poor. On top of that, the numbers of the poor keep
  growing. These are families that cannot afford the high cost of urban land,
  houses or services. The poor have few alternatives to where and how they live.


Note: National and local governments have not found effective, affordable ways to improve
the living conditions of the poor in cities because:
· urban policies need to be revised to concentrate on the problem of cities and the urban poor
· city regulations, planning and technical standards, are too high and too expensive
· land controls and land markets do not work in favor of housing for the poor
· financial systems do not meet the needs for housing the poor
· little official attention has been paid to finding new ways to help cities and the poor

What is being done now?                  Government's Urban Policies and Practices
Existing practices for dealing with the urban poor consist of:
· free housing for certain categories of very disadvantaged people
· eradication of poor communities built along canals and resettlement of
  residents into new areas
· development of low-income housing blocks
· efforts by the state to issue land use certificates and ownership rights
· sale of state-owned housing to the tenants
· attempts by local authorities to improve roads, drainage and sanitation
· efforts to bring the cost of utilities within reach of poor urban residents, while
  at the same time ensuring a sustainable service
· providing credit to households to install septic tanks or make other housing

                                                              work together. The policy is that projects must be presented to, discussed with, and controlled
                                                              by the residents. Community meetings are held and projects and their financing are discussed.
                                                              However, there is no policy that covers urban upgrading. The fairly rigid structure of local city

                                                              This is also why the many useful lessons learned from several small-scale pilot projects carried

     Why urban upgrading?
     The advantages and benefits of urban upgrading over
     other ways of dealing with the urban poor are that:
     · people obtain an improved, healthy and secure living
       environment
     · they are not displaced and therefore maintain their social
       cohesion and support networks
     · they do not lose the investments they have already made to
       their properties
     · resettlement is a costlier alternative and is less acceptable to
       them
     · regularization gives security of tenure, encourages investment
       in housing and makes a positive contribution to both the living
       standards of the poor, as well as to the national economy
     · many more people can benefit for the same amount of
       investment

    An example of upgrading benefits:
    In upgraded areas of Guatemala, infant mortality
    rates fell by 90 percent and crime by 43 percent.
                                                                          Ghana


      Question: Low-income
      communities are unattractive
      eyesores. Everyone wants a better-
      looking city. Government officials
      and city managers often ask: "Won't
      upgrading areas
      be unsightly        No! Over time, as residents are
      also?"              willing  to invest in fixing their
                          houses and environment, upgraded
                          communities evolve into attractive
                          places. Most of the time the upgraded
                          communities are much more pleasing,
                          functional and friendly than large-scale
                          redevelopment schemes.

2. Look at Examples and Lessons
 To find the most feasible and appropriate options for Vietnam, it helps to look at the local and international experiences and to select
 the elements that best fit its needs and possibilities.



Types of Urban Upgrading
There are several ways to do in-situ urban upgrading, as
practiced internationally. There is no right or wrong approach or
"model." Each country, or city, with different conditions and
needs, must decide on the best elements for its own project.
However, there are some basic design principles that generally
apply to all schemes and which help make the outcome best
suited to the target communities and result in fewer problems                                                                         Ghana
over time. The review of the upgrading experience in Vietnam
confirms that these principles are very appropriate to use.
                                                                             Advice: "Sectorial" or "Integrated" Upgrading - which one
                                                                             to chose?
                                                                             Upgrading in a community can be for one (single) service

                                                                             addressing only water supply or only drainage to prevent flooding.
                                                                             Many contain several service improvements provided at once in

    Start with ten proven principles for upgrading:
     1. Make sure there is political will, leadership and commitment for the program.
     2. Design for local needs and conditions-- there are many ways to do upgrading, so do not expect to have a standard "model."
     3. Apply the principle of subsidiarity- in which roles and responsibilities are best assigned to and performed at the lowest effective level.
     4. Provide security of tenure.
     5. Address the issues of regularization, land development and land legislation.
     6. Recognize upgrading to be an incremental process that takes time.
J    7. Go from simple to comprehensive, starting with the basic infrastructure and services (little else can happen if there is unsafe water, open
         sewers, or no safe places for children to play).

• Local participation is critical. Projects should be designed from the bottom up
working with communities and municipalities so that the communities decide what
levels of service they receive.
• Upgrading programs are most effective when led by the municipal authority
and implemented at the community level through a broad set of intermediaries
including community based organizations, NGOs, etc.

         How much does upgrading cost?
            Reference: the Can Tho example is indicative

         Several factors determine the cost of upgrading: how much new or                            Rough estimates are that in
         rehabilitated infrastructure will be included, what degree (level) of
         supply will there be - for example, one stand pipe for every 20                            Vietnam      upgrading in-situ
         families, or individual water connections to each house. Obviously                          would   cost  between US$75

         service provided. The other major factor is the residential density
         (how many people live on one hectare of land in the community).
         The more people or households per hectare, the lower the cost of
         upgrading per person, because the cost of the improvements are shared by more people. Other factors such as the topography and location
         (how far the upgrading settlement is from the main infrastructure lines) will affect the cost of upgrading per person or per hectare. The cost

         The studies produced an upgrading action plan for Can Tho City, that includes preliminary cost estimates. These illustrate the general costs
         of upgrading in Vietnam. The table below is for "multiple-service" upgrading packages (i.e., it includes basic services such as water supply,
         sanitation, drainage, access and street lighting at a minimum). The table shows the estimated costs of upgrading in Can Tho City.

     4. Make it happen
Upgrading programs are a large collaborative effort, with
central government encouraging and supporting its partners
at the city and provincia/level. Central agencies must find the
ways to make it easier for local governments to do their job.
There is no substitute for the city government in upgrading. It
has a key role in making things change and producing results.
Similarly, city governments and their partners - like the utility
companies providing services, and mass organizations and
NGOs that help communities participate - can facilitate the
task of those working to make the improvements. The
residents of upgraded communities will do their part in
making better places to live, if the other partners do not
hinder their efforts. All these collaborations can yield major
transformations for the poor and vulnerable in Vietnam's
cities if they each find new, more effective ways of working.

In summary ...
Vietnam's cities are confronted with major and growing
problems. While the challenges seem difficult, cities hold
great potential benefits for their residents, including the poor,
and for the country's economy. Fortunately for those charged
with making decisions about the future of Vietnam's cities,
                                                                     The steps proposed in the Guide

improving the conditions of the poor. The main message that         - applying these to the physical and institutional design of the program
comes out of the investigations is that urban upgrading is
viable and the most effective way to help the urban poor,           These should help make the decisions on how Vietnam can undertake
and it provides guidelines for how to plan and launch               a national urban upgrading program. The cooperation between levels

                                                                    also to tackle poverty, should not be underestimated. This can be the
                                                                    missing element that will convince all stakeholders to try new ways of
                                                                    working. This will create an enabling environment for reaching the

                                                                                                                                               17
          An Upgrading Example: A Sample Detailed Action Plan For Can Tho City*, included in the study, illustrates what
          constitutes the design of a program, including policies, strategies and plans for in-situ upgrading. It has five components:
          · Upgrading of existing identified low income areas
          · Improvements to city primary and secondary infrastructure
          · A strategy for unavoidable resettlement and house improvements
          · Improving security of tenure
          · Capacity building for communities and local government

          The plan includes low-income communities in 11 phuongs in Can Tho City, in which about 16,400 households (65,600 people) are without
          infrastructure or adequate housing. Unregistered households, make up another 10% of residents within these communities.

          The situation in Can Tho City at a glance:
          By 2010 the estimated Can Tho City population will be around 550,000 people, or 183,000 households. It is expected that almost 250,000 will be
          poor. That is about 75% of today's total population.
          The surveys of low-income communities show the extent and poor quality of life in the city's low-income areas:
          · 30% do not have their own metered water supply
          · 30% do not have had their own toilets
          · 27% do not have electricity connections
          · 40% of the alleys do not have street lights
          · 19% of the alleys are not paved
          · 21% of the alleys are subject to regular flooding
          · 60% of the households are not connected to a drainage system
          · 57% of the households do not have garbage collection

          The key policy changes proposed are:
          Adoption of flexible infrastructure engineering standards for low-income areas that can reduce costs and be applied in upgrading areas.
          Master Plans and Detailed Area Plans need to take into consideration the unique needs of the residents and communities to be upgraded.
          Demolition of low income areas and wholescale resettlement would be stopped, replaced instead by upgrading programs that would limit
i         resettlement to households that need to be moved because of danger or the construction of infrastructure improvements.
I         Specific operation and maintenance policies for upgraded areas to be used by maintenance agencies, and residents of the upgraded communities.
          Issuing Building Ownership and Land Use Certificates (BOLUCs) that give residents of upgraded communities confidence that they will not be moved

I
l
          from their existing locations.
          The city and utility companies are to make available the infrastructure needed for the upgrading areas. This calls for a review their city-wide plans
          to extend networks needed for the upgrading.
          Affordable housing finance to be established to make available a private sector supply of appropriate and affordable housing for low- income
          groups.
l         Training for upgrading agencies agencies should be developed and provided.

I         Summary of Action Plan Costs: The total estimated cost is US$ 26.9 million, not including the costs of improvements to city level primary and
          secondary infrastructure. It includes US$ 13.4 million for in-situ upgrading, US$ 2.1 million for needed relocation, US$ 8.5 million for land

I         development, US$ 2.0 million for house improvement loans, US$ 0.5 million for BOLUCs,and US$ 0.3 million for training.
          * The sample action plan was prepared in   early 2002. At the time of printing in mid 2003 detailed designs for a project to be funded by the World Bank were being prepared.
