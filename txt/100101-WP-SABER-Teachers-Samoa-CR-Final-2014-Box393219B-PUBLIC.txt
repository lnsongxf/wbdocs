    1. Setting Clear Expectations for Teachers                                               Established
        There are clear expectations for what students should learn and what teachers        zzz|
        should teach in Samoa. In addition, teachers are expected to evaluate and
        improve their abilities and are given time to do so.

    2. Attracting the Best into Teaching                                                     Established
       While opportunities for career growth may help attract aspiring teachers, it is       zzz|
       unclear whether schools have attractive working conditions.

    3. Preparing Teachers with Useful Training and Experience                                Established
       While integrating substantial practical professional experience into pre-service      zzz|
       training may help prepare teachers, providing a deeper knowledge of content
       and how to research and experiment with new teaching methods could create
       more effective teachers.

    4. Matching Teachers’ Skills with Students’ Needs                                        Established
       By offering incentives for teachers to work in hard-to-staff schools and              zzz|
       fellowships to attract teachers to subjects with a shortage of teachers, the
       system is more likely to ensure that it has teachers who can address student
       needs.

    5. Leading Teachers with Strong Principals                                                Emerging
       Principals are expected to support teachers in improving instruction, but do not      zz||
       receive any formal training. Requiring principals to have ongoing training in
       effective teaching methods and evaluation could empower them to improve
       learning outcomes in their schools.

    6. Monitoring Teaching and Learning                                                      Established
        All teachers are evaluated every three years by inspectors; in addition,             zzz|
        principals are required to conduct ongoing evaluations. Evaluations are
        designed to provide constructive feedback and improve teaching practice.

    7. Supporting Teachers to Improve Instruction                                              Latent
        Teachers are not required to complete any continuing professional                    z|||
        development training, and no policies ensure that professional development
        activities are collaborative and focused on improving instruction.

    8. Motivating Teachers to Perform                                                        Established
        Teacher performance can influence their promotions and appointment                   zzz|
        decisions. They can also be dismissed for poor performance, child abuse, and
        other misconduct.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of teacher
       policies.
