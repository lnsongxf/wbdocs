What is WET?
The Water Expert Team (WET) is a technical support
service that identifies and mobilizes on-demand high-
level expertise to address complex water challenges in
World Bank operations. World Bank operational teams
seek specialized WET support during project preparation
and implementation to tackle highly complex water
issues. This additional support informs decision-making,
promotes innovation and enhances project quality.

WET’s three main objectives are to:

WET Structure
The WET was created in January 2011 by consolidating
three Expert Support Teams (ESTs) established to meet
increasing demand for expertise in water supply and
sanitation (SWAT), hydrology (HEF), and groundwater
management (GW-MATE). This merge resulted in a new
entity with an increasingly responsive structure, and a
more efficient and streamlined administration.

WET is funded by the Water Partnership Program (WPP),          GW-MATE     HEF
a Multi-Donor Trust Fund created to enhance the World
Bank’s efforts to reduce poverty through improved water
services and water resources management, as well as the
mainstreaming of these in climate-resilient, green growth.          SWAT
It is based in the Water Anchor (TWIWA) in the Sustainable
Development Network (SDN) of the World Bank.

WET is managed by a senior TWIWA staff member
(the WET Task Team Leader (TTL)), aided by a Support
Group of technical specialists and a Program Officer. The
WET TTL and the Support Group ensure that activities
are in line with the WET objectives, are cost-effective,
respond to Bank and client needs, and add value to
Bank operations. A WET Advisory Committee – chaired
by the TWIWA Sector Manager and composed of senior
members of the World Bank’s water community – advises
on WET priorities, policy, strategy, and operation, and also

plays a role in its evaluation.

comprehensive technical support in the water sector to operational
World Bank teams, at the request of Task Team Leaders (TTLs).
Progress and Achievements
Since its creation, the WET has supported activities in
more than 35 client countries across the six World Bank
regions. WET assignments have supported World Bank
projects across all thematic areas in the water sector.
With a quarter of projects having a main focus on climate
change adaptation, WET has actively supported new
pragmatic approaches aimed at incorporating climate
change in the project design.

WET has also supported non-conventional initiatives
like the use of deep aquifers for urban water supply in
Africa and the design of workable solutions for on-site
sanitation in flood-prone areas. By combining results
of several activities and organizing knowledge-sharing
events, the WET actively seeks to stimulate global
dialogue in water and make innovative ideas available to
other World Bank teams.



“   The WET team did an outstanding
job. The team must be commended for
its efficiency and responsiveness and
understanding of the TTL needs.

Using WET was a refreshing experience.
This is a very good example of what
“people in operations” would like to get
more often from programs such as the
WPP.
         ”
