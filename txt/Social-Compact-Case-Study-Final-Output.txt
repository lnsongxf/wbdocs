The Social Compact Pilot was made possible by the continued interest of the Dicle Electricity Distribution Company
in working with civil society and local stakeholders to tackle issues of non-payment, trying innovative participatory
approaches, and collaborating with the World Bank during this process. The project was implemented by IDEMA, an
entrepreneurship initiative working on innovative social development projects, under the guidance of Zeynep
Darendeliler (TTL). Guler Altinsoy, Ali Ercan Ozgur and Dilara Gok at IDEMA worked tirelessly in designing and
implementing this project, and adapting plans with creativity as circumstances required. This Social Compact Case
Study note was written by Zeynep Darendeliler and Cansu Aydin.

The team would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the thinking that led to this activity and all those
provided formal and informal input. We are especially grateful to Sarah Keener, Nicolas Perrin, Sudeshna Banerjee,
Sameer Shukla and Chris Trimble for reviewing and providing guidance on the pilot from the design stage to the
finalization stage, and Ani Balabanyan, Michelle Rebosio, Sophia Georgieva, Daniel Ortega, Maria del Camino
Hurtado and Ezgi Canpolat for their input and contributions.
This pilot would not have been possible without the support and guidance of Kari Nyman, Elisabeth Huybens and
Martin Raiser, and funding from the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Knowledge and Innovation Fund, and the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).
Most importantly, we would like to thank the citizens of Mardin and Sanliurfa who participated in the social compact
activities to start building this dialogue.

Abstract

About 70 percent of electricity users in Southeastern Turkey are not used to paying for electricity, partially due
to the protracted situation of conflict and lack of trust between citizens and the government in the region.
Historic tension throughout the 1990s caused an inability for the government to invest in electricity
infrastructure and has resulted in low service quality. A large portion of consumers did not pay for electricity
use at all, since full electrification of these regions did not take place until the 1980s. This has also resulted in
wasteful and non-sustainable patterns of electricity use behavior. The social compact pilot implemented in two
provinces in this region, Mardin and Sanliurfa, set up stakeholder committees representing urban and rural
communities to forge and sustain a dialogue between the consumers and the electricity company on increased
electricity payment and improved service quality. The stakeholder committees came up with a joint
Stakeholder Committee Strategic Plan to address payment, service quality and communication issues. Moving
forward, the electricity company will institutionalize the Stakeholder Committee meetings, and start
implementing portions of the Strategic Plan, starting with an energy efficiency educational campaign and
improving its grievance redress mechanism. This is the beginning of a process to increase popular trust in and
dialogue with formal institutions in a region marked by a protracted conflict and a deep distrust in the state
and formal institutions.

Low-income man, rural: “Intermittent supply is widespread in villages. Several times a week the supply is
interrupted for 3-4 hours. During periods of heavy wind, the interruptions are more frequent. During winter
months there are more problems. This happens because the infrastructure is old. Some of the transformer polls
fall down. Therefore the supply is intermittent but people are expected to pay regularly for an irregular supply.”


A representative of the Association of Electrical Engineers: “It will take a concerted effort to change the habit
of using illegal energy. The distribution companies should get support from local authorities, municipalities,
public sector institutions, schools, and religious leaders. Regardless of political party affiliations, municipalities
should play a major role. Even our specialized experts are shocked with the variety of methods people come up
with to have unpaid electricity.”

Box 2. Electricity Use in Irrigation Water Pumps


Concerns regarding electricity use in irrigation are widespread in the Southeast of Turkey. The electricity
distribution company states that about 95% of farmers do not pay for electricity, with an estimated 4 billion
Kwh of electricity / year consumed at 45,000 wells. Rural respondents in the assessment stated that electricity
for irrigation costs about 30 to 40% of their gross income from agriculture and makes farming almost
prohibitive if they need to pay for the electricity. A farmer in Sanliurfa said:

“I drilled my own well to irrigate 300 decares of cotton fields. After paying for seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and
transportation, I received 60,000 TL for 120 tons of cotton. My electricity bill was 32,000 TL. Once I paid the
laborers, I had nothing left.”

The problem seems almost intractable with many inter-connected issues: There are crop subsidies for cotton
farming in the region and a significant amount of the light industry depends in cotton as input. Cotton is a
water intensive crop. Across the region, farmers note that they have had to dig deeper and deeper wells at
200, 300, 400 meters to access the ground water over the years. This creates environmental degradation and
increases the electricity costs for the farmers.

Ability to pay is an issue, but there are additional factors cited by respondents on why farmers should not pay
for electricity for irrigation. 1) Part of the region benefits from the largest irrigation scheme in Turkey,
Guneydogi Anadolu Projesi (GAP), under which the government invested in drip irrigation infrastructure on
farmers’ lands with water coming from the largest hydro reservoirs in Turkey. These farmers pay for the water
by a fixed rate system based on irrigated land area and type of crop. They can produce the same crops at much
lower prices, compared to the cost of farming with electricity bills. 2) The illegal users of electricity for irrigation
have “invested” a significant amount to set up the electricity system on their plot. A farmer from Bitlis
explained:

 “I built my entire system. I bought the transformer, all the wires to link to the main system. I paid for the labor
to install them. However now they also charge us for electricity.”
In response to the demands from farmers, the electricity distribution company in the Southeastern region has
proposed a fixed rate pricing system for electricity in mid-2014, similar to the water pricing. Farmers can choose
from plans to pay a fixed price based on the capacity of the transformer or the irrigated land area or the number
of irrigation wells. By the end of 2014 however, the rate of farmers signing up were less than 5%. This is largely
due to a distrust among the farmers in the region; they hesitate to officially register their transformers or wells
to benefit from the campaign, because they fear that the company may increase prices the next year.

                                      Five Constitutive Elements of Social Accountability
 Citizen Action          Awareness and salience among citizens of electricity privatization are very high; this directly
                         affects their lives and at times livelihoods. Citizens feel an intrinsic motivation for issues to be
                         resolved because they believe it is inherently unfair for them to receive such low quality
                         electricity service vis a vis the price. Citizens overall do not believe in the efficacy of their
                         actions; other than outright protesting, the citizens do not believe that individual or collective
                         actions will make a difference. Capacity for collective action is lacking leadership and strategy.
                         Costs of inaction are high.
 Service                 The service provider is painfully aware of the issues. Ability to resolve the issue is somewhat
 Provider Action         limited due to broader political context, electricity pricing set by regulator and the quality of
                         existing electricity infrastructure, but the company is able to take action on dialogue with
                         citizens, meeting some demands through different payment campaigns and making
                         investments in the electricity infrastructure in the medium term. Official attitude towards
                         engaging with civil society demands is very positive; the company makes public statements
                         about the need to engage, even though the actors they naturally engage with are limited.
                         Incentive and costs related to inaction are extremely high because at the current collection
                         rates, the company risks bankruptcy in the near future.
 Information             The company is striving to improve accessibility to information for citizens through
                         communication and public relations campaigns, but accessibility is still somewhat limited due
                         to the following reasons: The ad campaigns focus on timely payment and wasteful use, while
                         the citizens want to access more information on bill composition, metering, rules and
                         regulations, timing and duration of electricity cuts or payment options. Communication is one
                         way; citizens voice difficulty in reaching the company for answers. Due to limited accessibility,
                         consistency of information among citizens is weak; rumors and misconceptions abound. Trust
                         in information is very low due to overall political and social context.
 Citizen-Service         A good and accessible existing interface is not present. The only interface is the grievance
 Provider                redress mechanism of the company, which citizens find inadequate and hard to access.
 Interface               Effective interlocutors to mediate between the citizens and the service provider do not exist
                         in a meaningful manner; civil society and local leaders are quite strongly anti-electricity
                         company.
 Civic                   Mobilizers or media exist to make the issues public, but they do not have a strategy and often
 Mobilization            problematize the issues rather than seeking or producing solutions. Mobilizers such a local civil
                         society have credibility with citizens, but they do not have strong leadership to mobilize a
                         strategized campaign.
                               Macro Contextual Factors for Social Accountability Effectiveness

 Civil Society           There is some space for citizen voice and some capacity in civil society, which widely perceived

                         history of socio-economic inequality and exclusion; they do not have the commitment to work
                         together with the electricity company (which can create loss of legitimacy).

Box 4. Efforts to Align Macro Communication Campaign Messages with Social Compact Messages


At the design stage, it was envisioned to align the messages sent by the electricity company to its customers in
its already existing macro communication campaign with messages that would resonate with the findings of
the contextual analysis and the underlying reciprocal responsibility and benefit hypothesis of the social
compact. These efforts did not bear fruit however. The reason for this was multi-fold:

1) The communications campaign was designed based on new payment plans or campaigns, and developed as
these came along. There was no multi-year strategy that reinforced and built on certain messages.
2) The main message was on the need for payment, with emphasis that electricity was now run by a private
company that would need to make ends meet and could not tolerate non-payment at a loss like the previous
state-owned company. This did not change the discourse from a zero-sum game to a view that the consumers
would also benefit with visible improvement in service quality. In addition, given the broader political discourse
in the region regarding companies in the West of Turkey benefitting from the natural resources in the region,
such as large hydropower generation, filed research findings would not have counselled emphasizing the
private nature of the company.
3) Lastly, while the public relations campaign used local opinion leaders, such as imams to deliver messages
such as “theft is a sin,” these were usually one off meetings or message deliveries, as opposed to continuous
dialogue with civil society stakeholders who could have contributed to outreach to communities. In short, while
using the broader communications strategy as a consensus building tool was envisioned at the design stage,
there was not enough buy-in from the electricity company during implementation.
