This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       The applicant can either apply for a company name as part of the
       process, use a name that was previously approved, or register the
       company using the registration number given by the CIPC as company

       Register at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission
       (CIPC)

       An entrepreneur has 4 different ways to register a company with the
       Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). The most
       common form of registration is through the CIPC website
       (www.cipc.co.za). Registration can also be done at the self-service
       terminals, certain bank branches, and by email.
                                                                                 10 days on

       To register the company online, the entrepreneur needs to register as a    average
       customer on the CIPC website (www.cipc.co.za). Once registered, the
       applicant has to fund the new virtual account with at least 125 ZAR to
       cover the registration cost (125 ZAR). The account can be funded via
       wire transfer.

       During the registration process the following information must be
       provided:

      2. Details about the company:
      • Financial year end
      • Authorized shares
      • Email address, website, physical address and postal code

      Once the steps mentioned above are completed, an email will be sent
      to the applicant requesting additional documentation to be emailed to
      CIPC:
      • Certified ID copies of all indicated initial directors and founders
      • Certified ID copy of applicant if not the same as one of the indicated
      initial directors or founders
      • Signed registration forms

      Finally, once the company is registered, the customer receives an email
      confirming that the company is registered and a link back to the CIPC
      website to retrieve the disclosure certificate and all the incorporation
      documents.

      Agency: Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC)



      Open a bank account

      In order to open a bank account, the applicant must submit proof of

      The entrepreneur must submit the EMP 101e form which is available
      online or at the local SARS office. Registration is immediate and can be
      done online or at the branch.

      • Pay as you earn (PAYE) tax refers to the tax required to be deducted
      by an employer from an employee’s remuneration paid. The employer
      is compelled to register in terms of paragraph 15 of the 4th Schedule to
      the Income Tax Act.

      • Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF): These funds are used to provide
      short-term relief should workers become unemployed or unable to
      work for various reasons. Any employer who is liable to register for the
      employees tax (PAYE) is required to register with SARS for the
      unemployment insurance contributions.

      • Skills Development Levy (SDL): This levy is used by the government to
      fund education and training as stated in the Skills Development Act,
      1998. This levy is payable monthly by employers to SARS.

      Register for VAT

      Businesses with annual taxable turnover of more than ZAR 1,000,000
      must register for VAT. The application for the registration of VAT is
      done on a VAT 101 form.

      VAT registrations are completed in real time at the entrepreneurs'
      nearest SARS branch. It typically takes a week to secure an
      appointment. In order to register for VAT, an entrepreneur will need to
      complete and sign the VAT 101 form and submit the form together with
      the following documentation:
      (1) certified copy of certificate of incorporation;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      founding documents of the seller will be the Memorandum and Articles
      of Association. If the buyer company was formed before May 1, 2011, its
      Memorandum and Articles of Association will be examined. If the buyer
      company was formed after May 1, 2011, only its Memorandum of
      Incorporation will be examined.
      b. Review the necessary resolutions. Section 115 of the Companies Act
      71 2008 states that a company may not dispose of all or the greater part
      of its assets except through a special resolution.
      c. Ensure compliance with the Financial Intelligence Center Act by
      obtaining proof from the companies of the physical/business address
      and the Tax/VAT registration number with the South African Revenue
      Services. The conveyancer will also request this information from the
      clients before proceeding, and the check is done automatically at the
      time the transfer duty is paid. If a company does not have or quotes an
      incorrect Tax/VAT number, it will be unable to pay the transfer duty, and
      the process will come to a halt.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in South Africa (table 8.1)?

                   South Africa made paying taxes easier for companies by
DB2014             replacing the secondary tax on companies with a dividend tax
                   borne by shareholders.
                   South Africa made paying taxes more costly by increasing the
                   rates of vehicle tax and property tax. At the same time the rate
DB2017             of social security contributions paid by employers was reduced.
                   South Africa made paying taxes more complicated by
                   increasing the time it takes to prepare VAT returns.

requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

 Indicator        Answer                                        Explanation
                                    The most likely procedure applicable to our case study would be a
                              reorganization. By applying the New Companies Act, Mirage would file for
                            business rescue voluntarily by the board passing a resolution to this effect and
                                appoint a business rescue practitioner (BRP) for the company before the
                               default of payment arises. The BRP's role is to develop a rescue plan that
                            would probably involve restructuring the debt of the company and/or possibly
                            acquiring new businesses that would aid in re-activating the operations of the
                              company and/or selling the business as a going concern and/or selling the
             liquidation
                               shares in the company. Bizbank is a secured creditor of the company. The
               (after an
Proceeding                       security held by Bizbank cannot be sold without its consent unless the
             attempt at
                              proceeds from the sale of the security will cover the debt of the creditor (ie
           reorganization)
                              Bizbark) in full. Therefore, during business rescue, a secured creditor is in a
                           relatively good position and retains its security. The practice of business rescue
                           is currently widely used. The New Companies Act suggests a 3 month period to
                             complete business rescue proceedings though in practice this time period is
                               extending from time to time with the support of the majority of creditors.
                           Should the business rescue proceedings fail for one reason or another, the BRP
                            will file a termination notice with the CIPC and apply to the High Court for the
                                                        liquidation of the company.

                                 gazette and conducted by an auctioneer appointed by the liquidator.

                                   When reorganization is converted to liquidation it usually takes approximately
                                   2 years. In accordance with the provisions of the New Companies Act, business
                                   rescue proceedings are designed to last for a period of 3 months from start to
                                     finish. However, in practice, business rescue proceedings are extended from
                                     time to time with the support of the majority of creditors. If business rescue

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.
       Has 60 employees.
       Is subject to collective bargaining agreements if
        such agreements cover more than 50% of the

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
