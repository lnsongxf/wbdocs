II. Methodology
In May and June 2013, 665 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Colombia were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank Group-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 271
stakeholders participated in the country survey (41% response rate).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned completed questionnaires
similarly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Colombia; their overall attitudes
toward the World Bank Group; the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results; the World
Bank Group’s knowledge and convening services; working with the World Bank Group; the
World Bank Group’s future role in Colombia; the World Bank Group’s communication and
information sharing in Colombia; and development organizations in the region.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Colombia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Colombia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty in Colombia,
   and how to best achieve “shared prosperity”.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (WBG): Respondents were asked to rate
   their familiarity with the WBG and the IFC, the WBG’s effectiveness in Colombia, the
   effectiveness of the WBG’s collaboration, the WBG’s staff preparedness to help Colombia
   solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding the
   WBG’s work, and the extent to which the WBG is an effective development partner and the
   WBG’s services meet the national development needs of Colombia. Respondents were also
   asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the WBG to
   focus its resources, the WBG’s greatest weaknesses in its work, with which stakeholder
   groups the WBG should collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed
   or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Group Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the WBG’s work helps achieve development results in Colombia, the extent to which
   the WBG meets Colombia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   WBG’s level of effectiveness across nine aspects of Colombia’s national development plan.

II. Methodology (continued)
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge and Convening Services: Respondents were asked to
   indicate how frequently they interact with the WBG on knowledge and convening services
   and to rate the quality of the WBG’s knowledge and convening services, including how
   significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
   Respondents were also asked if they consulted the most recent LAC Flagship Report and if
   so, to evaluate it.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the WBG, such as working
   with the World Bank Group increasing Colombia’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Colombia: Respondents were asked to rate to
   what extent the World Bank has moved in the right direction in the last three years, how
   significant a role the WBG and international development corporation should play in
   Colombia’s development in the near future, and how significant a role the IFC should play in
   helping Colombia achieve its goals in the future. Respondents were also asked to indicate
   what the WBG should do to make itself of greater value in Colombia and which services the
   WBG should offer more of in Colombia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about development issues, how they prefer to receive information from the
   WBG, and their usage and evaluation of the WBG’s website. Respondents were asked about
   their awareness of the WBG’s Access to Information policy, past information requests, and
   their level of agreement that they use more data from the WBG than a few years ago.
   Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the WBG and that the WBG is responsive to information requests.
H. Development Organizations in the Region: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   and impressions of effectiveness with the Inter-American Development Bank and Latin
   American Development Bank.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the WBG, whether they are an
   IFC client, their exposure to the WBG in Colombia, which WBG agencies they work with,
   and geographic location.


In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 147 respondents (37% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2011 and the 170 respondents (44% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2007. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the office of a Minister were combined with those
        from the office of the President; respondents from CBOs were combined with those from
        NGOs; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those
        from the private sector; and the few respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian and
        the judiciary were included in the “Other” category.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Survey. These
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard.


Focusing World Bank Group Resources
       In the FY ’11 country survey, respondents indicated that it would be most productive for
        the Bank to focus most of its resources on access and quality of education (29%),
        infrastructure development (24%), increasing employment (20%), and reducing poverty
        (20%). In FY ’07, respondents indicated that the Bank should focus on reducing poverty
        (40%), increasing access to education (34%), and increasing employment (23%).

The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)

       Respondents’ ratings of the effectiveness of the World Bank Group in Colombia was
        significantly higher than their ratings of the effectiveness of the Latin American
        Development Bank in Colombia, but statistically similar to that of the Inter-American
        Development Bank.
       The World Bank Group’s effectiveness in Colombia received a mean rating of 7.0 across
        all respondents, statistically similar to the mean overall effectiveness rating received in
        the FY ’11 country survey (7.0), and significantly higher than the mean overall
        effectiveness rating received in the FY ’07 country survey (6.3).
       Respondents across stakeholder groups and both geographic locations had statistically
        similar ratings for the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness in Colombia and for the
        extent to which the World Bank Group’s work helps to achieve development results in
        Colombia.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)

Greatest Weakness

       Respondents in the FY ’11 country survey indicated that the Bank’s greatest weaknesses
        in its work in Colombia were not enough public disclosure of its work (39%), being too
        bureaucratic in its operational policies and procedures (31%), and the length of time it
        takes to process loans (27%). Respondents in the FY ’07 country survey indicated that
        the Bank’s greatest weaknesses were imposing technocratic solutions without regard to
        political realities (30%) and being too bureaucratic in its operational policies and
        procedures (30%).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness
Specific Areas of Effectiveness
   Because of the focus on thematic objectives of the World Bank Group’s strategy to support
    Columbia’s national development plan, there were just two opportunities to compare the
    WBG’s effectiveness to that in the FY’11 and FY ’07 country surveys. Respondent s in this
    year’s country survey gave significantly higher ratings of effectiveness for the WBG having
    an impact on “Opportunity in Education” compared to respondents in the FY’11 country
    survey (6.2), but statistically similar to the mean rating received in FY’07 (6.3). Respondents
    across all country surveys had statistically similar ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness at
    “Social protection and improved citizen security”.
   Respondents from the office of the President/Minister had the highest ratings for the WBG
    having an impact on “Opportunity in Education” whereas respondents from NGOs/CBOs,
    independent government institutions, and academia gave significantly lower ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Colombia, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the nine specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Colombia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection and improved citizen security;
             The WBG’s effectiveness at performance of social services; and
             The WBG’s effectiveness at productivity and innovation.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Colombia, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The area determined to be a key driver from these
        analyses was:
             The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection and improved citizen security.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates

The World Bank Group’s Work in Colombia

       Repondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement that
        “Overall the World Bank Group currently plays a relevant role in development in
        Colombia” and that “The World Bank Group’s work is aligned with what I consider the
        development priorities for Colombia” compared to FY ’11 respondents (5.9 and 6.3,
        respectively) and FY ’07 respondents (6.1 and 6.1, respectively).
       Respondents from the office of the President/Minister had the highest levels of agreement
        that “The World Bank Group is an organization that does not represent a particular
        ideological perspective in Colombia” whereas respondents from academia had
        significantly lower levels of agreement.

Overall Perceptions
       Repondents in this year’s country survey had statistically similar levels of agreement for
        all statements that could be compared to respondents from the FY ’11 country survey.
       Consultants on WBG-supported projects and respondents from PMUs and multilateral
        agencies had the highest levels of agreement that “The World Bank Group disburses
