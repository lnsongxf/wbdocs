2014 as part of the “Do You See What I See” project. According to UNHCR, the project “lets young refugees
shine a light on their world and share it with others. Through writing and photography workshops led by
photojournalist Brendan Bannon, they learn to capture their observations in a few lines of poignant prose
or a single striking photograph.”

Foreword




The ongoing crisis in Syria has taken a toll on millions of lives, with its effects
reverberating around the globe. Thousands have died, and nearly half of the
country’s population has been displaced, either internally or to neighboring
countries and beyond. As of December 2015, nearly 4.4 million Syrians had
registered as refugees. Every day, more families are forced to leave their homes in
search of safety and stability elsewhere.
   The world has an urgent responsibility to address this situation and to make
sure that the short-term needs of refugees are paired with medium- and long-
term strategies to support both refugees and host communities so that both can
manage the different shocks they have experienced.
   As the Syrian crisis deepens, humanitarian and development organizations are
coming together to bridge the historical divide between their approaches. The
World Bank Group and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
have joined forces to share and analyze available data on Syrian refugees living in
Jordan and Lebanon, in order not only to better understand the welfare of refu-
gees, but also to help create a more sustainable system to address their needs
throughout their time in exile.
   This book shows that Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon have expe-
rienced shock after shock, pushing them into destitution. A majority are living in
poverty now, and are likely to stay poor in the future, with added psychological
and financial stresses that compound what they are already facing.
   The current crisis is as much about long-term development, as it is about
short-term needs. While existing programs that provide food and cash assistance
have been effective in reducing poverty among refugees, they are not designed
for medium- and long-term support. The coordination between humanitarian
and development partners is ever more important. In the medium and long term,
governments and the international community will need a different institutional
and financial framework to address the needs of refugees and host communities
alike. Policies for refugees must move toward self-reliance, focusing not only on
transfers and better access to public services, but also on facilitating access to the
labor market and fostering economic inclusion.
   This longer-term view can become a critical part of the growth and develop-
ment strategy for areas hosting refugees. By scaling up existing services, matching
people with jobs, building a business environment that promotes growth,

                                                                                           xi

      investing in people’s health and education, boosting regional trade and attracting
      investments, refugees and host community members can share in progress and
      move forward together.
         The World Bank Group and the UNHCR will continue to work together to
      provide in-depth analysis and practical solutions, from both the humanitarian
      and development perspectives. It is our sincere hope that this can help allow
      refugees and host communities together to turn a humanitarian crisis into a
      development opportunity—ensuring a more stable, prosperous future for all.

Executive Summary




     “Refugees are people like anyone else, like you and me. They led ordinary
     lives before becoming displaced, and their biggest dream is to be able to
     live normally again.”
                           Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General


Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, over 6.5 million of the country’s people
have been internally displaced and almost 4.4 million are registered refugees.
This amounts to about half of the Syrian Arab Republic’s pre-crisis population.
Due to the large humanitarian response, there is now a wealth of available infor-
mation on refugees’ income and expenses, food and nutrition, health, education,
employment, vulnerability, housing, and other measures of well-being. These
data have not yet been fully explored to optimal effect for analytical, policy, and
planning purposes.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World
Bank Group (WBG) are working together to analyze this evidence, and to ensure
that policy makers and advocates have the knowledge they need to better serve
refugee communities. The WBG’s know-how on welfare and targeting, com-
bined with the UNHCR’s expertise on the needs of refugees, can lead to more
effective analyses and policies for registered Syrian refugees living in Jordan and
Lebanon. Their expertise can also help promote a more efficient use of financial
resources. This book is the result of a comprehensive collaboration between the
two institutions. It aims to increase our understanding and ultimately improve
the well-being of Syrian refugees.


Key Findings
Refugees differ from regular populations. Compared with pre-crisis Syria, the
Syrian refugee population living in Jordan and Lebanon is younger (81 percent
are under age 35, versus 73 percent of pre-crisis Syrians); comprises a higher
share of children aged 0–4 (close to 20 percent versus 11 percent); and tends to
be single (over 60 percent versus 40 percent). Refugees have larger households;



                                                                                        xv

      they have more children, many of whom are more likely to be married; and they
      tend to be less educated and more likely to be farmers. Prior to becoming refu-
      gees, many had suffered repeated shocks within Syria, leading them eventually to
      abandon their assets, property, and capital and seek safety in the neighboring
      countries. Therefore, these refugees have unique and specific needs distinct from
      regular populations.

      Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon live in precarious circumstances.
      Although many Syrians are registered as refugees with the UNHCR and the
      authorities, this does not confer legal rights or entitlements for assistance. The
      majority of refugees in both countries live on the margins, in urban and peri-
      urban areas, many in informal settlements. Their access to government services is
      severely constrained by supply shortages generated by the enormous increase in
      demand. Only a minority are housed in refugee camps, where most of their
      essential material needs are met and financed by the international community.

      In 2014, 7 in 10 registered Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon could
      be considered poor.1 This number increases to 9 in 10 refugees if the poverty
      lines used by the respective host countries are considered. The poverty of Syrian
      refugees is higher in Jordan than in Lebanon. In Jordan, there is also evidence
      that poverty among refugees has increased by several percentage points between
      2013 and 2015.

      Family size and housing are the best predictors of poverty. In Jordan, for exam-
      ple, the poverty rate almost doubles if the size of the family goes from one to two
      members and increases by 17 percent from one to two children. Single people
      and people over 50 have the lowest poverty rates while people aged between 35
      and 49 experience the highest poverty. Families renting or owning property and
      living in an apartment or house made of concrete with piped water or a proper
      latrine are less poor.

      Refugees are highly vulnerable. About 55 percent of refugees in Jordan are vul-
      nerable to monetary poverty and about 50 percent are vulnerable to food shocks.
      Over 35 percent of refugees are poor today and vulnerable to poverty in the near
      future. About 88 percent are either poor today or are expected to be poor in the
      near future. Conversely, only 12 percent of refugees are neither poor today nor
      vulnerable to poverty in the near future; this is the only group of refugees that,
      at present, can be considered not at risk.

      Current refugee assistance programs are very effective in reducing poverty. If
      administered to all refugees, the UNHCR cash assistance program and the World
      Food Programme (WFP) food voucher program can each cut poverty by half.
      They can also reduce poverty to less than 10 percent if administered jointly and
      universally.
Executive Summary                                                                         xvii


However, these programs are not sustainable and cannot foster a transition from
dependence to self-reliance. They rely entirely on voluntary contributions and,
when funding declines, fewer of the most vulnerable refugees are able to benefit.
Moreover, social protection on its own does not foster a transition to work and
self-reliance if access to labor markets and economic opportunities is not
available.

These findings suggest that the current approach to managing refugee crises in
the medium and long term is not sustainable. The focus must shift beyond social
protection for refugees to include economic growth in the areas hosting them, so
that refugees and local communities can share in economic progress. This para-
digm shift requires continued close collaboration between humanitarian and
development partners, in order to transform a humanitarian crisis into a develop-
ment opportunity for all.

Background and Motivation
As June 20th marked World Refugee Day, the global count of registered refugees
and internally displaced persons (IDPs) has reached the highest level since World
War II, with a combined figure of over 50 million people (13 million refugees
and 38 million IDPs).1 In addition to their humanitarian dimensions, refugee and
IDP crises reflect development failures that are not easily remedied. The average
time that a person spends as a refugee is 17 years. Unless given the opportunity
to lead a “normal” life, generations of refugees in prolonged exile experience
frustration and impoverishment. This marginalization generates loss of skills, lowers
self-confidence, and hampers the capacity of a population to rebound from shocks.
   Part of the problem is that refugees are financially constrained and, unlike
regular citizens, are often denied access to basic opportunities such as public
services or employment. They are more vulnerable to human exploitation, such
as trafficking, survival sex, and crime. Preventing the impoverishment of refugee
and IDP communities enhances their prospects for a stable future and facilitates
their return home when conditions permit.
   Critical to addressing these challenges and their effects is a more detailed
knowledge of refugee welfare, poverty, and vulnerability. Building on such
knowledge requires specialized expertise on both welfare measurement and refu-
gees and, in this respect, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) and the World Bank are ideal partners. The World Bank can offer
know-how on welfare and targeting that can possibly result in more effective
analyses and policies aimed at improving the well-being of refugees and more
efficient use of financial resources. The UNHCR, for its part, can provide the
World Bank with expertise on a particularly unique population and its specific
protection and assistance needs, given its official status. Refugees, IDPs, and
migrant populations are rarely captured by World Bank poverty statistics, because
these statistics are based on national household surveys usually covering the resi-
dent population only. Household surveys, in turn, are not designed to capture the




                                                                                          1

    particular features of refugee or displaced populations. These two facts combined
    result in losing sight of the welfare of over 50 million people worldwide.
       This is no minor issue for the World Bank. The overarching goal of the World
    Bank is to reduce extreme poverty, defined as those living on less than US$1.25
    in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP), globally to 3 percent by 2030.2 If today
    we cannot estimate poverty among displaced people worldwide, we may overes-
    timate our poverty achievements. The number of displaced people has been on
    the rise in the past decade and may increase in the years to come, especially if we
    do not recognize the poverty dimension and address its causes during the early
    stages of displacement. Refugees and displaced people are not just part of the
    poverty problem; they should be considered as part of the poverty solution.
    Cooperating with the UNHCR enables the World Bank to expand the knowl-
    edge base on refugees with the objective of enhancing development and future
    progress, and thereby reaching the twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and
    boosting shared prosperity.
       A joint study on the welfare of refugees can also help the two organizations
    to bridge the historical divide between humanitarian and development work by
    providing practical solutions for assisting refugees in the short, medium, and long
    term and preventing the irreversible loss of social and human capital typically
    associated with prolonged refugee crises. This is a natural response to the fact
    that refugee crises have become longer but also a requirement of the interna-
    tional donors’ community in order to streamline aid and make it more effective.
    A welfare analysis of refugees and the challenges they face can help the UNHCR
    to better understand why certain refugees cope better than others, how to
    improve targeting, and how to selectively invest in areas with a better potential
    for the long-term well-being of refugees. A welfare analysis can also help hosting
    governments better understand how to turn a humanitarian crisis into a develop-
    ment opportunity by preventing a deterioration of living conditions of refugees
    and hosting populations and by finding improved solutions for allowing refugees
    to contribute to the host nation’s welfare.
       Since the beginning of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, there have been
    over 6.5 million IDPs, 4.4 million registered refugees, and 1.5 million non-refu-
    gee migrants (www.unhcr.org). This amounts to about half of the pre-crisis
    Syrian population. The response of humanitarian organizations to the crisis has
    been so large that it is now possible to rely on an unprecedented archive of data
    on Syrian refugees, including data on income and expenditure and many other
    dimensions from food and nutrition to health, education, employment, vulnera-
    bility, housing, and others. This data archive is surprisingly little explored as
    humanitarian organizations face daily challenges that make the full exploitation
    of existing data very difficult.
       The World Bank and the UNHCR began working together in March 2014 to
    analyze existing data collected on refugees in Jordan with the objective of study-
    ing the welfare of refugees and improving on the UNHCR’s targeting capacity.
    This work resulted in a study that proved useful for identifying some of the
Overview                                                                                3


shortcomings of existing targeting methods and proposing alternative solutions
for improvements. In parallel to this work, the UNHCR in Lebanon experi-
mented with new surveys and data analyses that provided further insights into
refugees’ welfare, vulnerability, and aid targeting. These two blocks of work
(Jordan and Lebanon) constitute a significant amount of data and information
that can be further explored to better understand the welfare of refugees.
   This report builds on the work carried out in Jordan and Lebanon in 2013 and
2014 and expands it to produce a comprehensive welfare, poverty, and vulnera-
bility assessment of refugees in the context of the Syrian crisis. This is the first
collaboration of its kind for both the World Bank and the UNHCR and it was
made possible by an unprecedented data-sharing agreement between the two
institutions as well as by the close collaboration between the two institutions at
headquarters and field level. This assessment can inform policy design to improve
the well-being of refugees and mitigate the crisis’ impact on hosting communi-
ties. It can also inform the development of new strategies to assist refugees, bridg-
ing the historical divide between humanitarian and developmental assistance.


Structure of the Report and Questions Asked
   Chapter 1 of the report presents a socioeconomic profile of Syrian refugees in
Jordan and Lebanon. It provides first a brief background to the crisis and then
compares the socioeconomic profile of refugees with that of the Syrian popula-
tion before the crisis and with the hosting populations of Jordan and Lebanon.
This chapter addresses the questions: (1) Who are the refugees? (2) How differ-
ent are refugees from “regular” populations? While these questions may seem
obvious to specialists, refugees are a selected subsample of regular populations
and it is important to understand what makes refugees different. These differ-
ences can then help us to understand how to adapt development policies toward
this special type of population.
   Chapter 2 provides a poverty and welfare assessment of Syrian refugees in
Jordan (see box O.1 for a few methodological notes on measuring poverty in a
refugee context). We first provide a poverty profile of refugees to understand
what groups of refugees are poor, what their socioeconomic characteristics are,
and where the pockets of deep poverty are located. We then model welfare and
poverty to better understand the main predictors of these two factors in the
context of the atypical status of refugees. This chapter addresses the questions:
(3) How poor are refugees? (4) What are the main predictors of refugees’ welfare
and poverty? Again, while these are standard questions addressed in a develop-
ment context and for which a solid body of answers exists for many countries,
asking these questions for a refugee population is relatively new and not as obvi-
ous. Refugees are rarely captured by national household surveys and a population
of refugees is very particular in its income and expenditure opportunities, some-
thing we wish to explore in detail in this book.
4                                             The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon




    Box O.1 Measuring Poverty in a Refugee Context
    The measurement of poverty relies on three essential instruments: household data, a welfare
    aggregate, and a poverty line. This box summarizes the choices made in the book on these
    three instruments.

    Household data. The book focuses on registered refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon out-
    side camps, estimated at about 85 percent of all refugees living in these two countries in 2014.
    It relies on data extracted from the global registry system of refugees maintained by the
    UNHCR (ProGres) and on four other data sets collected by the UNHCR and the World Food
    Programme (WFP) in Jordan and Lebanon. The Jordan data include the second and third
    rounds of the home visits data (JD-HV2 and JD-HV3), which are home visits undertaken by the
    UNHCR for the purpose of targeting. The Lebanon data include the second round of the vul-
    nerability assessment (LB-VASyR) and the verification survey (LB-Verif), this last also an instru-
    ment designed for targeting purposes. All survey data have been collected between October
    2013 and December 2014. The core part of the report (chapters 2–4) focuses on Jordan and on
    the second round of the home visits data. Chapter 5 uses all four data sets. A full explanation
    of the data used is provided at the outset of each chapter.

    Welfare aggregate. The book uses expenditure aggregates throughout as indicators of wel-
    fare. This is a choice that is typically made for poor countries where data on income are scarce
    or unreliable. This report tested both income and expenditure measures and found income to
    be underreported as compared to expenditure, which explains the preference given to expen-
    diture. The expenditure aggregate constructed is based on a restricted number of items
    (between 10 and 14 items depending on the data set considered). This range of items is signifi-
    cantly smallera than what would normally be collected in household consumptions surveys
    and the resulting expenditure aggregate is expected to be less reliable than aggregates con-
    structed using larger sets of items. In a refugee context, this may be less of a problem given
    that food vouchers, low income, and limited mobility force refugees to rely on a restricted
    number of consumption items; but it is nevertheless an important issue to consider when read-
    ing the results of this report. Chapter 2 provides a series of tests of alternative welfare measures
    and explains the methodology and rationale for our choice of expenditure aggregate.

    Poverty line. As a poverty line, the book uses the threshold selected by the UNHCR for its cash
    assistance program given its relevance for refugees and for the UNHCR. This is JD 50/person/
    month in Jordan, which is equivalent to JD 1.64 /capita/day or US$5.25 in 2005 purchasing
    power parity (PPP). It is important to note that, unlike the international poverty lines or coun-
    try-specific poverty lines, the UNHCR threshold is not constructed using a basic needs
    approach based on a food basket and basic nonfood needs, and it cannot be considered as a
    poverty line anchored to minimum food requirements and minimum calories. Thus, it is not
    possible to compare the estimates of refugee poverty reported in this report to the national
    poverty estimates of Jordan or Lebanon. It is simply a threshold that, in US$ PPP values, is
    located in between the international poverty line and the poverty lines used by Jordan and
    Lebanon. Chapter 2 provides sensitivity tests to show how poverty changes when we change
    the poverty line. Chapter 5 provides a comparative analysis of poverty in Jordan and Lebanon
    using the same poverty line to test how this line performs in different country contexts.
    Note: a. The number of items can vary depending on the survey ranging from a few items to hundreds of items and there is
    evidence that accuracy increases by increasing the number of items and reducing the recall period (Beegle et al. 2012).
Overview                                                                               5


    Chapter 3 digs into the question of vulnerability using data from Jordan. This
chapter uses first the economic interpretation of monetary vulnerability to mea-
sure this phenomenon among refugees and then applies similar instruments to
nonmonetary vulnerability concepts in use among humanitarian organizations to
understand whether monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability really measure
two different conditions. We also compare these vulnerability outcomes with the
poverty outcomes observed in chapter 2 to understand how the concepts of
poverty and vulnerability overlap. The questions addressed in this chapter are:
(5) How vulnerable are refugees from a monetary and nonmonetary perspective?
(6) Do poverty and vulnerability statuses overlap? These questions are relatively
new not only in relation to refugees but also more generally for the economics
literature.
    Chapter 4 of the report turns to policies by taking stock of the results emerged
from chapters 1, 2, and 3. This chapter evaluates first the targeting capacity of
existing policies toward refugees and also devises a simple instrument to reach
an optimal targeting strategy by maximizing coverage while minimizing leakage
with available resources. In a second stage, we simulate alternative policy out-
comes in various areas including education, labor, and social protection to see
whether improving the status of refugees in these different areas can also
improve their welfare. This chapter addresses the questions: (7) How effective
are refugee assistance programs? (8) What is the potential for alternative poli-
cies? These are no simple questions of course, neither from a policy nor from a
technical perspective. Feasible policies toward refugees have to strike a delicate
balance between the needs of refugees, the needs of hosting communities, and
the political concerns of hosting countries. These are often conflicting objectives
but policies that fail to align them are unlikely to succeed. The technicalities of
simulating alternative policy reforms are also complex. Several methods are
available but we are outside the realm of controlled random experiments and
face severe challenges in finding good counterfactuals. Nevertheless, we will test
two alternative policy simulation methods and compare results in an effort to
learn a few lessons on the potential of alternative policies toward refugees.
    Chapter 5 of the report focuses on comparing results across countries and data
sets and testing the applicability and reproducibility of results in different coun-
tries hosting refugees and with different types of data. This is done by comparing
results of chapter 2 with results in appendixes A, B, and C. The welfare and
poverty assessment of chapter 2, based on Jordan data, is reproduced in a semi-
identical fashion using a second set of data for Jordan (appendix A) and two
other data sets for Lebanon (appendixes B and C). The purpose of chapter 5 is
to understand whether the main results of chapter 2 are strictly country specific
and whether they depend on particular types of data. The questions addressed
here are: (9) How does welfare compare across countries and data sets? (10)
How transferable are the findings across countries and data sets? The compara-
tive analysis of chapter 5 is carried out in two parallel processes. We first make
an effort to compile the four data sources into one data set by harmonizing the
variables that could be harmonized, transforming the welfare aggregates into
6                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


    comparable U.S. dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP), and constructing a
    single poverty line. The second exercise compares chapter 2 and appendixes A,
    B, and C and tries to extract lessons from this raw comparison. Of course, we are
    only considering two countries and four data sets and the population of refugees
    considered is the same Syrian population in both countries. However, the data
    are heterogeneous and the hosting countries of Jordan and Lebanon have signifi-
    cant differences. This should be seen as a first, nonexhaustive step in drawing
    more general lessons about refugees, their welfare, and welfare predictors.


    Summary of Results
    (1) Who are the refugees?
    Refugees are a subset of a regular population who, due to a combination of
    shocks, follow a path leading into poverty and destitution in a foreign country.
       The distress of those Syrians who eventually became refugees did not start at
    the onset of the crisis in 2011. For many people, it started a decade earlier and is
    explained by a combination of global financial shocks, domestic agricultural
    shocks, and conflict. The second half of the 2000s has been characterized by a
    sharp increase in oil prices, which benefited exports but resulted in large price
    increases in both commodities and food prices. These negative shocks were com-
    pounded by the effects of a prolonged drought that affected the country during
    the years leading to the 2011 crisis. Millions of people living in Syria at the time
    of the outbreak of the crisis had already been on the move within the country
    and were in economic distress, including over a million Syrians who moved out
    of the rural areas affected by the drought and settled in the peripheries of the
    main urban centers already characterized by low living standards. These are the
    same peripheries that saw harsh fighting during the conflict, resulting in millions
    of IDPs. By the end of 2014, about half of the Syrian population was displaced,
    including an estimated 6.5 million IDPs, 4.4 million registered refugees, and 1.5
    million non-refugee migrants (www.unhcr.org).
       After fleeing the country, those Syrians who became refugees settled preva-
    lently in poor areas of hosting countries and concentrated in a few governorates
    situated along the borders. About 65 percent of all Syrian refugees in our data
    went to Lebanon and about 35 percent to Jordan. The overwhelming majority of
    Syrian refugees registered in Jordan came from the southern province of Dar’a
    (47.1 percent) in Syria and settled in the border governorates of Al-Mafraq (26
    percent) and Irbid (24 percent) in Jordan, or in the periphery of the main urban
    center Amman. Similarly, the majority of refugees registered in Lebanon came
    from the northern governorates of Homs (21.4 percent) and Aleppo (20.5 per-
    cent) or from rural Damascus (14.1 percent) and about 85 percent of these refu-
    gees settled in three governorates of Lebanon: Bekaa (36 percent), North
    Lebanon (25 percent), and Mount Lebanon (25 percent). Most of the refugees
    come from relatively poorer areas in the country of origin and settled in relatively
    poorer areas in the countries of destination. Syrians who eventually registered as
Overview                                                                              7


refugees are evidently the result of negative shocks that resulted in an overall
increased impoverishment of this population.

(2) How different are refugees from “regular” populations?
Syrian refugees are systematically different in their socioeconomic characteris-
tics from the Syrian pre-crisis population and from the populations of the coun-
tries that they moved to (Jordan and Lebanon).
   The population living in Syria before the crisis had some important differ-
ences with the neighboring populations of Jordan and Lebanon. For example, the
Syrian population had a similar age structure to the one in Jordan but it was
much younger than the one in Lebanon. The education level in Syria was similar
to that in Lebanon but much lower than that of Jordan, and the female labor
force participation rate was similar in Syria and Jordan but higher in Lebanon.
Syria had a much higher share of the population employed in agriculture as
compared to either Jordan or Lebanon. The differences between the Syrian refu-
gee population and the populations of Jordan and Lebanon are expected to be
much greater. This can be inferred by comparing the Syrian refugee population
with that of pre-crisis Syria. The Syrian refugee population is much younger, the
level of education is marginally lower, there is a much higher proportion of chil-
dren and female head of household, and Syrian female refugees are also more
likely to be married under the age of 18.
   This very young age and particular family structure point to the fact that large
parts of the population have specific needs, especially for schooling and health
care, those public services that hosting countries were suddenly called to provide
for Syrian refugees at the outset of the crisis. A refugee population has large
humanitarian needs in terms of protection, shelter, and nutrition; but refugees
also face critical development challenges including: (i) limited access to basic
services due to the limited capacity of institutions in host communities to pro-
vide the quantity and type of basic services needed by a refugee population; (ii)
limited capacity of refugees to provide for themselves due to constrained access
to markets and economic opportunities; and (iii) erosion of human capital due
to low school enrollment rates, prolonged gaps in education, and inactive use of
skills and professions. These are development challenges that require special
measures to assure that the long-term development trajectory of Syrians and
hosting countries is not permanently harmed by the refugee crisis.

(3) How poor are refugees?
Based on a monetary threshold used by the UNHCR to target its cash assistance
program, the great majority of refugees in Jordan are poor, a finding that is
robust to several sensitivity tests.
   The UNHCR in Jordan uses a monetary threshold of JD 50/capita/month to
target its cash assistance program. This poverty line is equivalent to JD 1.64/
capita/day or US$5.25 in 2005 PPP. The line is high if compared to the interna-
tional poverty line used by the World Bank to measure extreme poverty
(US$1.25 2005 PPP) and is low if compared to the poverty lines used by Jordan
8                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


    (JD 2.6 or US$8.2 PPP) or Lebanon (LBP 8,935 or US$10.3 PPP) to measure
    poverty in their respective countries. In July 2015, JD 1.64 in Jordan would buy
    2 kilograms of rice or 1.5 kilograms of apples, 3 single-way tickets on local trans-
    port, 3 kilometers in a taxi, about one day of electricity for an apartment of 80
    square meters, one-third of a meal in a cheap restaurant, or a pack of cigarettes.
    Considering a family of four, JD 200 per month (JD 50 times 4) is expected to
    cover essential basic needs in terms of food, transport, and perhaps some cloth-
    ing, but this amount would be insufficient to cover shelter, utilities, assets, or
    leisure activities.
        Using the UNHCR poverty line of JD 50/capita/month (US$5.25/PPP/per
    capita per day), the report finds 69 percent of refugees in Jordan and 64 percent
    in Lebanon to be poor. These shares are 87 percent and 93 percent, respectively,
    if we use the poverty lines adopted by hosting countries. In Jordan, it was also
    possible to observe that refugee poverty increased from 69 percent to 73 percent
    between 2014 and 2015. A typical very poor case3 (first quintile or the bottom
    20 percent of the population) would be composed of almost seven people, it
    would be headed most likely by a male who is married, with children, with a low
    level of education, and around the age of 40. About 60 percent of the case mem-
    bers would be children, with most but not all children attending school. The case
    would most likely come from Dar’a, Homs, or Hama governorates in Syria,
    would have crossed the border unofficially and most likely settled in Irbid,
    Amman, or Mafraq in Jordan. By contrast, a typical non-poor case (fifth quintile
    or the top 20 percent of the population) would be headed by someone who is
    much less likely to be married, who is better educated, somewhat younger, and
    living in a case made of only two people with the unlikely presence of children.
        The poverty profile shows that the group which entered Jordan before the
    Syrian crisis and the latest group of entrants have the lowest poverty rates,
    whereas the peak of poverty is associated with those who entered during 2012
    and 2013, which coincides with the peak of the Syrian crisis. The majority of
    refugees entered the country unofficially (57.5 percent) and this group suffers
    from higher poverty irrespective of the point of entry, with a difference of almost
    18 percentage points compared to those who entered officially. Refugees follow
    particular trajectories depending on where they flee from and where they settle
    in Jordan and these trajectories reveal different paths to poverty. For example,
    refugees coming from the Syrian governorates of Aleppo and Damascus and
    going to the Jordanian governorate of Tafilah are among the poorest, with the
    quasi-totality of this group being poor.
        Characteristics of the principal applicant (PA)4 provide some insights about
    the poverty status of a case. Poverty is the highest for the age group 35–49, pre-
    sumably because this is the group with the largest number of children of young
    age. For the same reason, poverty is also higher for married and engaged people
    as opposed to other marital status groups. Single people have the lowest poverty
    rate and this is also true for people aged 50 and more. In general, poverty
    increases as we pass from white-collar types of occupations (pre-crisis) to blue-
    collar types of occupations. Surprisingly, the highest poverty rate is found among
Overview                                                                                9


skilled agricultural workers. The group with the PA having 6–8 years of education
(almost half of the population) is also the group with the highest poverty rate. If
we cross-tabulate different characteristics of the PA, we can find cells with
extreme poverty rates such as skilled agricultural workers with 9–11 years of
education of which eight in ten people are poor. Hence, agricultural workers who
may have been particularly affected by the drought in Syria before the crisis
remain the poorest population group in the post-crisis refugee status.
   Characteristics of the case provide additional insights. Larger cases and cases
with higher shares of children are poorer. This is a known phenomenon but it
seems to be widespread in the Syrian refugee population. The poverty rate jumps
significantly for each additional case member and for each additional child. For
example, from one to two members, the poverty rate almost doubles and
increases by 17 percentage points from one to two children. It is also noteworthy
that for a few cases, the case size is equal to the number of children. These are
cases where all case members are children. In fact, the situation of children is also
revealing. School-age children are expected to be in school but refugee children
face many challenges in enrolling in educational institutions due to scarce supply,
financial constraints, crowding, psychological distress, and other issues that would
normally not be an issue for children in regular populations. Only about half of
Syrian refugee children in Jordan attend school despite the fact that Jordan pro-
vides free education to refugees. About 34 percent of the refugee population in
Jordan lives in cases where at least one child is not attending school. Children out
of school are more at risk of child labor. About 3.6 percent of the population lives
in cases where at least one child is working. This is likely to be a lower bound
estimate as child work is one of the questionnaire items that is most likely to be
under-reported because of shame or legal issues.

(4) What are the main predictors of refugees’ welfare and poverty?
Case size and housing variables are the best predictors of welfare and poverty
followed by selected characteristics of the principal applicant.
   Through econometric modeling, we are able to identify the key predictors
of welfare and poverty for Syrian refugees in Jordan. Following a systematic
process of variable selections, we reached a final welfare model including a total
of 23 variables and a final poverty model including 22 variables. The first and
most important variable in both models is case size which alone explains 18
percent of the variability in welfare and 22 percent of the variability in poverty.
Paying rent or owning the property in which the case lives is the second most
important factor explaining between 3 and 4 percent of both the welfare and
the poverty model. The region of destination of refugees has an explanatory
capacity of between 1 and 1.5 percent. All other factors with the exception of
the house area per person in the poverty model have an explanatory power
below 1 percent. In particular, important characteristics of the principal appli-
cant that are associated with improved welfare are: a professional occupation
prior to the crisis, older age, higher education, and married status. Other impor-
tant housing-related factors are: having electricity, piped water, a latrine,
10                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     kitchen, and proper building materials. The place of origin and destination of
     refugees, the point of entrance, and whether refugees entered formally or infor-
     mally are other factors that contribute to explain welfare. Overall, the welfare
     model explains 53 percent of the variability in expenditure and the poverty
     model explains 38 percent of the variability in poverty. These percentages are
     generally considered good-fit for models of this kind.
        We also tested the capacity of the poverty models to predict poverty correctly.
     Considering a JD 50 poverty line and a 50 percent probability threshold, the
     model is able to correctly predict if a case is poor 90.1 percent of the time, which
     implies that 9.9 percent of the time the model predicts poor cases as non-poor
     (under-coverage or exclusion error). The model also predicts correctly if a case is
     non-poor 60.9 percent of the time, which means that 39.1 percent of the time
     the model predicts non-poor cases as poor (leakage rate or inclusion error).
     Evidently, the first type of error (under-coverage) is more problematic from a
     policy and welfare perspective while the second type of error (leakage) is more
     problematic from a budget perspective. We also find that there is a clear trade-off
     between increasing coverage of the poor and decreasing leakage to the non-poor.
     However, one can fine tune the cutoff point chosen for the probability threshold
     to optimize the best trade-off between these two outcomes, something that is
     explored in more detail in chapter 4 of the book.

     (5) How vulnerable are refugees from a monetary and nonmonetary
     perspective?
     Monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability are high but they are not necessarily
     related to one another.
         The report finds about 55 percent of refugees in Jordan to be vulnerable to
     monetary poverty using a poverty line of JD 50/capita/month.5 These findings
     are robust to various specifications of the monetary vulnerability model and
     indicate that vulnerability does not decline linearly with the poverty line.
     Predictors of vulnerability are similar to the predictors of welfare and poverty but
     not identical.
         Nonmonetary vulnerability is also high but not necessarily related to mone-
     tary vulnerability. We selected two popular indicators: The WFP Food
     Consumption Score (FCS) and the UNHCR Crowding Index (CI). We find
     about 50 percent of refugees to be vulnerable to the food dimension and about
     42 percent to be vulnerable to the crowding dimension. However, the economet-
     ric modeling work shows that it is difficult to find predictors for the FCS while
     it is much easier to find predictors for the CI, which are similar to the predictors
     of welfare and poverty. In fact, the distribution of food and monetary vulnerabili-
     ties are almost unrelated. Policies that address monetary vulnerability such as
     cash transfers may not help in addressing food vulnerability, an important lesson
     from a policy perspective. Conversely, the cross-tabulations between crowding
     and monetary vulnerability show a high association between these two phenom-
     ena. For 77 percent of observations, the two criteria provided the same outcome
     in terms of vulnerability. Therefore, addressing crowding with a cash transfer may
Overview                                                                               11


be a promising approach, whereas this is not the case for food vulnerability as
defined by the WFP.

(6) Do poverty and vulnerability statuses overlap?
Poverty and vulnerability statuses overlap but less than expected and results are
sensitive to the choice of poverty line.
   Poverty and vulnerability are two related but clearly different concepts. Using
a poverty line of JD 50/capita/month, only about 51 percent of poor refugees
today in Jordan are also vulnerable to poverty in the near future, a share that
reaches 63 percent if the poverty line is lowered to JD 25/capita/month. This
is equivalent to 35 percent of the total population of refugees and is what we
could consider the hard-core poor. Conversely, about 11.3 percent of the total
population of refugees are non-poor today and expected to stay non-poor in
the near future. This is the better-off group that is unlikely to need any assis-
tance. The rest of the population (53 percent) is expected to change status in
the near future. The predictors of vulnerability are similar to those of poverty
but they may behave differently and they have different sensitivities to the
poverty line.
   The volatility in poverty status and the sensitivity of poverty and vulnerability
to the poverty line make the UNHCR work quite complex from a welfare moni-
toring and social assistance perspective. Refugees are screened for assistance only
occasionally and the UNHCR does not have the resources to re-interview all
cases every year. As the movement in and out of poverty is high, coverage of the
poor and leakage to the non-poor is expected to increase over time. To address
this problem, one possibility is to combine poverty and vulnerability indicators,
target refugees who are both poor and vulnerable, exclude refugees who are both
non-poor and non-vulnerable, and use additional screening mechanisms (such as
good predictors of poverty) to select the rest of beneficiaries.

(7) How effective are refugee assistance programs?
The current refugee assistance programs are very effective in reducing poverty if
administered universally but the introduction of targeting severely reduces this
capacity.
   Syrian refugees currently benefit from two major assistance programs: The
UNHCR cash assistance program and the WFP food voucher program. At the
time of data collection, the UNHCR cash assistance program in Jordan provided
JD 50 per month to cases including one or two members, JD 100 to cases with
3–5 members, and JD 120 to cases with more than five members. The WFP
program in Jordan included two bi-weekly vouchers for a total value of JD 24
per person per month.
   With universal coverage, both programs have the potential to reduce poverty
significantly. The UNHCR cash assistance program can reduce poverty from 69.2
percent to 39.3 percent and the WFP food voucher program can reduce poverty
to 32.3 percent The combination of these two programs, if administered univer-
sally, can bring poverty down to 6.9 percent, a major achievement. However, at
12                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     the time of data collection, only the WFP program had quasi-universal coverage
     while the UNHCR cash assistance program was targeted using a combination of
     income and nonmonetary inclusion and exclusion criteria. This targeting reduced
     the cost of the program substantially, but our estimations show that the program
     was able to reduce poverty from 69.2 percent to 61 percent only. Due to budget
     constraints, the WFP program is also in the process of being scaled down and we
     should expect this program to have a smaller impact on poverty due to the
     reduced coverage. These programs are therefore relevant from a welfare perspec-
     tive but this relevance is significantly scaled down by targeting and reduced
     coverage due to budget constraints.

     (8) What is the potential for alternative policies?
     The potential of alternative policies is grim. Classic development policies acting
     on education, skills, and the labor force have very low returns in a refugee con-
     text because of the very status of refugees and the limited set of economic
     opportunities.
        The report simulates the impact on poverty and welfare in Jordan of changing
     certain attributes of the refugee population, simulating in this way the indirect
     effects on welfare of policies affecting these attributes. We find weak or no
     effects for policies that would affect the level of education, skills, or work status
     of the principal applicant. The reasons are simply explained. Due to their sta-
     tus, refugees live in an environment in which returns to education and skills are
     almost nil. Returns to informal work are so low that we do not observe any
     welfare difference between those who work and those who do not work.
     Formal employment requires a work permit, which is difficult to obtain as
     witnessed by the small number of refugees in Jordan who obtained this permit
     (about 6,000 in 2014). Even the income of refugees with a work permit does
     not stand out as a poverty-reducing mechanism. For example, the work permit
     variable is almost invariably non-significant in the welfare and poverty models.
     The only policies that may be both viable and effective are housing policies. In
     particular, policies aimed at reducing rents may prove effective as an alternative
     to cash transfers.
        Returns to labor supply policies such as increased education and skills are low
     because economic opportunities for refugees are low. For development policies
     to become effective and a viable substitute to transfers, the set of economic
     opportunities available to refugees has to expand. While it is essential to continue
     investing in education and skills, substituting the existing monetary transfers with
     these policies is not an option at present. The lack of economic opportunities
     reduces returns to education and skills and changes returns in ways that we
     would not expect in a regular labor market. For example, we find cases headed
     by high-skilled refugees to show higher poverty than cases headed by skilled
     ones. These results highlight the long-standing dilemma faced by humanitarian
     agencies in seeking to transition from emergency humanitarian programs to long-
     term development programs. They suggest that there are no simple pathways at
Overview                                                                             13


the policy level to address the challenge of improving refugees’ welfare and
reducing poverty in the absence of transfers.

(9) How does welfare compare across countries and data sets?
The distribution of expenditure, mean expenditure, and poverty rates are within
the same range in Jordan and Lebanon and across data sets, despite differences
in sampling and other measurement issues.
    Considering the fact that the samples of refugees in different countries and
data sets are very different, differences observed in mean expenditure and pov-
erty rates are not large. Comparing expenditure distributions, we find that
LB-Verif data show the highest values across the four data sets considered,
whereas among the three remaining data sets (JD-HV2, JD-HV3, and LB-VASyR)
there is no absolute dominance in welfare. For lower parts of the distributions
(among poorer people), JD-HV2 data show the lowest welfare; for upper parts
of the distributions (among richer people) JD-HV3 data show the lowest wel-
fare. Moreover, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) curves cross several
times, indicating that the ranking between distributions changes at each crossing
point. We also found that the ranking across data sets shown by the poverty gap6
is not necessarily the same as the one shown by the poverty rate. This means that
results on poverty are sensitive to the choice in poverty line and to the depth of
poverty, a result that confirms findings in chapter 2 of the book.
    Looking at the poverty rates (headcount, poverty gap, and severity of pov-
erty),7 we find that refugees in Jordan are poorer than refugees in Lebanon. The
poverty rates estimated using JD-HV2 and JD-HV3 data are higher than the
ones estimated for Lebanon. The JD-HV3 data show the highest poverty rate
overall (73.2 percent). The poverty gaps are also higher in Jordan as compared
to Lebanon but the poverty gap for JD-HV2 is higher than for JD-HV3. The
same is true for the severity of poverty. This indicates that, overall, poverty
increased between the two rounds of the Jordan HV data but it declined among
the poorest individuals. Instead, if we look at Lebanon, the poverty rates for the
LB-VASyR data are always higher than poverty rates for the LB-Verif data. This
is likely due to the different samples considered between the two surveys. The
LB-Verif includes those refugees who appealed as they were excluded from the
WFP food vouchers and are therefore expected to be better off on average.

(10) How transferable are the findings between countries and data sets?
Findings are similar across countries and data sets and, for a core set of dimen-
sions, they are transferable.
   The poverty profile is similar across the four data sets considered and, hence,
between Jordan and Lebanon. The welfare and poverty models find a set of core
variables to consistently predict poverty and welfare across countries and data
sets. Variables that almost invariably predict higher poverty and lower welfare
are: (1) case or household size; (2) the number of children; (3) crowding; and (4)
unofficial arrival in the country. Variables that almost invariably predict lower
poverty and higher welfare are: (5) renting or owing the property; and (6) living
14                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     in an apartment or house made of concrete. Having piped water or a proper
     latrine are also often found to be good predictors of increased welfare and
     reduced poverty. These are important findings because the four data sets consid-
     ered are very heterogeneous in terms of samples, questionnaires, data collection
     methods, and degree of representation of the underlying population of refugees.
     Such findings provide the UNHCR with a solid baseline to target the refugee
     population based on a rather restricted number of indicators and irrespective of
     how the samples, questionnaires, and data sets are constructed.
        There are clearly more similarities than differences in the two welfare and
     poverty modeling exercises in Jordan and Lebanon. Similarities may be attrib-
     uted to the fact that the emergency context is similar (urban, protracted crisis),
     the affected population is similar although not identical (demographically, socio-
     economically, culturally), and the host countries have similarities (middle
     income, urbanized). This leads us to conclude that there is scope for improving
     and harmonizing the UNHCR’s data-collection efforts across countries and also
     within countries. If this is done, the UNHCR will be in a very good position to
     target refugees based on a restricted number of indicators and on a reduced set
     of data-collection exercises, something that could contain the cost of the existing
     refugees’ assistance programs significantly.


     Policy Implications
     As we learned from the results of this report, refugees are not a random sample
     of a population but a group who followed a particular trajectory determined by
     shocks and which leads into refugee status. Many among the Syrian refugees in
     Lebanon and Jordan had been in economic distress and on the move within Syria
     before the conflict because of a prolonged drought that affected the country dur-
     ing the years that led to the crisis. Over a million rural residents moved into the
     peripheries of the large cities, the same peripheries that would become the the-
     ater of heavy fighting during the conflict. Conflict was then responsible for dis-
     placing millions of people within Syria. Among this last group, some would find
     accommodation and resettlement within the country while others would opt or
     would be forced to leave. And among those who left the country, some would find
     a decent occupation and accommodation in the first country of asylum or other
     foreign countries, whereas the majority would register as refugees and become
     dependent on external assistance. The welfare status of households played a role in
     each of these selection processes and those who registered as refugees are expected
     to be a poorer subsample of the pre-crisis Syrian population.
        Indeed, the report finds refugees to be, according to the UNHCR and hosting
     countries thresholds, very poor and highly vulnerable. These findings apply to
     both Jordan and Lebanon and also to the different data sets considered. As we
     saw, seven in ten refugees are poor if we consider the UNHCR threshold. Nine
     in ten refugees are poor if we consider the poverty lines used in Jordan and
     Lebanon, respectively. The range of good predictors of welfare and poverty is
Overview                                                                               15


rather narrow, which is consistent with populations characterized by high pov-
erty. Case size, housing conditions, and a few characteristics of the principal
applicant explain about half of the variability in expenditure and these predictors
are very consistent across countries and data sets. Vulnerability, defined as the
probability of experiencing poverty in the near future, is also found to be high
among refugees and only partially overlapping with poverty. There is a thick layer
of people who are not poor today but likely to experience poverty in the future.
Many refugees come in and out of poverty frequently, adding to the phenome-
non of economic insecurity. Monetary and nonmonetary measures of vulnerabil-
ity can reflect very different needs; not all types of vulnerabilities can be
addressed through financial means.
   Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon live in precarious legal and material
circumstances. Although many Syrians are registered as refugees with UNHCR
and the authorities, this does not automatically confer legal rights or entitlements
for assistance. Nor are refugees housed in refugee camps where most of their
material needs are met and financed by the international community. The vast
majority in both countries are living on the margins in urban and peri-urban
areas, many in informal settlements. They do have access to government services,
although these are severely strained by the additional demand constituted by the
refugee population. Humanitarian assistance delivery is insufficient to provide
the full range of essential needs (food, accommodation, water) and services
(health, sanitation, education). Limited formal access to the labor market and
economic opportunities also constrain the prospects for self-reliance.
   This complex welfare situation essentially keeps Syrian refugees in a poverty
trap, which poses questions about the current policies and assistance arrange-
ments for refugees. Refugees spend a large amount of their time to meeting basic
needs and accessing basic services. They have very limited access to markets and
economic opportunities, mostly in the informal sector. Existing refugee policies
are effective in reducing poverty but they remain assistance measures that offer
only temporary subsistence but no transition to work or improved access to eco-
nomic opportunities. Returns to skills, former occupations, and education are
extremely low. Our policy simulations show that typical development policies that
invest in skills, education, and employability are unlikely to succeed in improving
welfare if they are not accompanied by more comprehensive measures aimed at
creating proper economic opportunities. The simulations indicate the limitations
of the current approach to managing Syrian refugees and the economic implica-
tions and consequences of their marginalization in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Confronted with this poverty trap, the international community faces a clear
dilemma. On the one hand, keeping refugees in poverty cannot be beneficial to
refugees, hosting governments, hosting communities, or the future of Syria.
Poverty is associated with negative outcomes in a variety of dimensions, including
health, education, crime, and insecurity, that cannot be in the interest of any
stakeholder. On the other hand, continuing and expanding cash assistance and
other support programs have their own challenges and limitations. Humanitarian

     funding invariably decreases after the emergency phase of a crisis. Cash transfers
     are more efficient in meeting essential needs, especially during the early phase of
     displacement. They provide greater dignity and flexibility to the recipients. But
     they have not yet featured as longer-term instruments for social protection and
     there is a risk that without careful monitoring, they might create dependency
     were they to be sustained over the longer term. Moreover, in themselves cash
     transfers do not foster a transition to better economic prospects and do not pro-
     vide an answer to the real questions of creating development opportunities for
     refugees and hosting communities and of fostering economic growth in the
     region affected by the crisis.
         What are the alternatives to the current status of refugees and what policies
     could be imagined as an alternative to cash transfers? Hosting governments and
     humanitarian and developmental organizations engaged in the assistance to
     Syrian refugees require a different institutional and financial framework designed
     to address the short- and medium-term needs of refugees and hosting communi-
     ties. In addition to transfers and better access to public services, this framework
     should foresee measures designed to lower entry barriers to the labor market and
     foster economic inclusion of refugees. Medium-term refugees’ assistance policies
     should be seen as part of a medium-term growth and development strategy for
     areas hosting refugees and including hosting communities. In this sense, the spe-
     cific policies required are not very different from policies designed for develop-
     ment and growth such as scaling up existing services, matching existing labor
     demand and supply, building a business environment conducive to economic
     growth, providing financial instruments tailored to small and medium businesses,
     upgrading human capital, boosting regional trade, or creating special economic
     zones to attract investments. Such policies are often recommended for poor areas
     or areas affected by major calamities or economic downturns, and could be con-
     sidered in the context of the refugee crisis that is not short term.

                     Concepts and Definitions

Individual and Social Welfare
In this work, we follow the standard economic approach of considering individ-
ual welfare, well-being, and utility as one and the same concept. These terms
refer to a psychological and emotional state of happiness that derives from our
past, present, and potential abilities, capabilities, and circumstances. For simplic-
ity, we will use the term welfare throughout the work.
    Economics has followed two different traditions in the measurement of indi-
vidual welfare; the first uses a “direct” approach and the second uses an “indirect”
approach. The first tradition of measuring welfare directly has also followed two
different approaches. The first approach relies on subjective questions on hap-
piness or life-satisfaction measured on scales of various dimensions such one to
four or one to ten. The second approach relies on more objective assessments of
happiness or pain with instruments capable of measuring these feelings. The
first of these direct approaches has been made popular in recent years by the
economics of happiness literature, which is now becoming mainstream in eco-
nomics. The second of these direct approaches was pioneered by Edgeworth
(1881) and has been used more recently in prospect theory (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979).
    The second tradition in the measurement of individual welfare takes an indi-
rect approach by measuring individual choices in the market place. This has been
the dominant approach in economics over the past century and constitutes the
bulk of what is taught in microeconomic theory today. The underlying idea is
that happiness cannot be directly observed and measured but it can be measured
indirectly, thanks to the revealed preferences that individuals express in their
consumption choices. If I consume more sugar, it is because I expect this addi-
tional consumption to increase my happiness. Under certain assumptions, by
measuring consumption, it is possible to derive the additional utility that a per-
son enjoys from this consumption.
    In this work, we will follow the orthodox economic approach of measuring
welfare indirectly via the revealed preferences approach. We do this for the
simple reason that the quasi-totality of the welfare economics literature, and the

                                                                                          19
20                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     models and methods that derive from this literature, have been developed under
     this framework. The passage from individual to social welfare is also straightfor-
     ward. We will consider social welfare as the sum of individual welfare. This
     implies that we consider identical individual utility functions across individuals,
     with no interrelations between utility functions.


     Monetary and Nonmonetary Welfare Measures
     We should then distinguish between monetary and nonmonetary welfare mea-
     surement. Various organizations use the terms economic and noneconomic wel-
     fare, but it is preferable to use the terms monetary and nonmonetary as they
     clarify, in our view, the nature of the variables at hand.
        We can measure welfare using monetary indicators such as income, expendi-
     ture, or consumption or we can measure it with nonmonetary indicators such as
     asset indexes, or measures of deprivations in various dimensions such as health or
     education. The advantage of monetary indicators is that items of different sorts
     can be combined together with a natural weight, which is the monetary value of
     each item. This is why, for example, gross domestic product (GDP) is expressed
     in monetary value and not in physical quantities. The disadvantage of monetary
     indicators is that there are dimensions of welfare that cannot be easily captured
     with a money metric—such as the sense of security, friendship, or love—which
     evidently contribute to happiness, well-being, and utility.
        Nonmonetary indicators can be constructed for many dimensions, but they
     can only be counted and do not have natural weights for the different dimen-
     sions. For example, one can count the property assets that an individual may have
     such as a car or a house, but there are no natural weights that one could apply to
     these items when they are aggregated into an index. One has to determine in a
     normative way what the most appropriate weights should be and normative
     choices have always advantages and disadvantages.
        In this work, we use both monetary and nonmonetary indicators. The central
     work on welfare modeling will focus on monetary indicators; but the work on
     vulnerability will also model nonmonetary indicators and study the relation
     between monetary and nonmonetary indicators. It is important to note that
     while welfare usually refers to individuals, monetary welfare is mostly measured
     at the household level. That is because a household is defined as a group of indi-
     viduals who share the same income and consumption. Hence, individual welfare
     is derived by dividing household (case) welfare by the number of people in the
     household (case).


     Deprivation and Poverty
     Monetary and nonmonetary welfare measures when applied to a population or
     a sample of a population result in welfare distributions. Welfare distributions are
     simply the collective representation of the welfare of a society by means of the
     selected welfare measure. They do not tell us anything about poverty or
Concepts and Definitions                                                                    21


deprivation of a population or subgroups of this population. If we want to mea-
sure poverty, monetary or nonmonetary, we need to introduce the concept of
deprivation and determine a threshold under which a person may be considered
deprived. We define deprivation as the lack of resources (financial and non-
financial) preventing households from meeting basic needs.
   Deprivation refers to the lack of resources in a broad sense. This includes the
lack of all resources or material benefits (financial and non-financial) that allow
refugee households to meet their basic needs. Conditions that lead to deprivation
include threats to personal security; limited access to basic services such as shel-
ter, health, education, as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); food
insecurity or insufficient nutrition; crowding; application of negative coping
strategies; and others. Some non-financial deprivations may or may not be
improved by access to financial resources. For example, even if a refugee house-
hold has financial resources to afford safe WASH facilities, these services may not
be accessible or available for purchase in the areas where the refugees live.
Similarly, if the cause of insufficient nutrition is lack of knowledge, then provid-
ing financial resources will not address the problem.
   If we are considering a continuous measure of welfare such as income, expendi-
ture, the number of cars, or the number of rooms, then we need to define a thresh-
old under which a person may be considered deprived. For example, we consider
poor all persons that fall below the poverty line, which is a monetary threshold for
a monetary welfare measure. But we can also define thresholds for other continuous
measures such as the number of cars or the number of rooms in a house. We could
consider as “car deprived” a person who has zero cars and “rooms deprived” a
person who lives in a house with less than two rooms. Humanitarian organiza-
tions use several thresholds of this type, such as a maximum number of people
per toilet or a minimum number of square meters of floor space per person.
   Vice versa, with discrete, non-continuous measures such as being sick or not
being sick or having a fridge or not having a fridge (this can apply to cars of
course if we prefer to use a binary indicator instead of a count indicator), one can
only attribute values of “0” for “not have” and “1” for “have.” In this case, deprivation
simply coincides with “not have” and one can aggregate deprivation at the soci-
etal level by counting the number of deprived persons or households in society.
   Poverty and deprivation can be used as synonyms. We can speak of poverty in
various monetary and nonmonetary dimensions and we can speak of deprivations
in monetary and nonmonetary dimensions. This is also the approach followed in
this study, although the term poverty will be mostly reserved for monetary indi-
cators of welfare. In particular, the poverty profile provided in the welfare assess-
ment is based on monetary indicators.
   Once the welfare dimensions we are interested in (such as income or expen-
diture) and the deprivation threshold (such as the poverty line) are defined,
deprivations can be added up in a multidimensional deprivation or poverty
index. The tricky part is how to aggregate the different dimensions (for example
by individual first and then by dimension or, vice versa, by dimension first and
then by individual) and how to weigh each dimension. Decancq and Lugo
22                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     (2013), for example, reviewed the different weighting strategies and find tens of
     different methods, each providing different results. Once the dimensions are
     aggregated, the multidimensional indicators become continuous of course and
     one needs to establish a threshold to define who is multidimensionally deprived
     and who is not.
        One question is whether multidimensional indicators are more effective in
     capturing welfare than the sum of their parts. Humanitarian agencies often use
     composite indexes to capture various dimensions of deprivation, which, by
     design, may or may not relate directly to the welfare of refugees. The extent to
     which composite indexes on vulnerability are effective in measuring the depriva-
     tion of refugees remains up for debate. To further this question, it is essential to
     assess the relationship of indexes to one another and to further test the capacity
     of composite indexes to assess refugees’ deprivation and well-being. In this study,
     we show that is preferable to use simple rather than composite indicators to
     make the most of existing information on refugees. Nevertheless, composite
     indicators may be necessary when a latent phenomenon is not easily captured by
     available indicators.


     Vulnerability
     Development and humanitarian organizations make widespread use of the con-
     cept of vulnerability. Vulnerability is a key dimension of well-being since it affects
     refugees’ behavior (in terms of investment, production patterns, and coping
     strategies), their ability to respond to shocks, and the perceptions of their own
     situations. However, quite different meanings are attributed to this term by vari-
     ous organizations and what exactly we mean by vulnerability is subject to debate.
     Humanitarian organizations use the term vulnerability in a broad sense and for
     multiple purposes. The term vulnerability includes addressing non-financial
     deprivations such as legal protection, personal security, dignity, access to basic
     goods and services, and others.
        The term vulnerability is not formally used by the United Nations High
     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Rather, the UNHCR speaks of persons
     of concern who are “at risk” of being deprived of their rights as defined by inter-
     national human rights, humanitarian, and refugee law. For example, international
     law defines access not only to basic needs and services, but also to protection
     processes or security from violence. The UNHCR Division of International
     Protection prefers the term “at risk” to vulnerability, as the latter suggests help-
     lessness or passivity. That said, in recent months the term vulnerability, and more
     specifically economic vulnerability, has been used more frequently within the
     context of the targeting efforts for Syrian refugees.
        However, on the operational level and in the context of the Syrian crisis, the
     term vulnerability is used in various contexts. The UNHCR is using the term
     economic vulnerability to define the target group for cash assistance, and the
     eligibility criteria for this program are both monetary and nonmonetary. For
     example, income or expenditure are used to separate the poor from the non-poor
Concepts and Definitions                                                                 23


and additional protection and vulnerability criteria are used for targeting to
complement the expenditure criteria. Moreover, different criteria are used in dif-
ferent surveys like the Vulnerability Assessment on Syrian Refugees (LB-VASyR)
in Lebanon or the Home Visits in Jordan as detailed below.
   The World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), and UNHCR in Lebanon initiated the Vulnerability Assessment on
Syrian Refugees (LB-VASyR), a project that aims at identifying a set of variables
that could be used as key eligibility criteria for targeting beneficiaries. This orga-
nization understands vulnerability as a multi-sector concept with indicators
spanning across numerous sectors.1 In Lebanon, household vulnerability is the
presumed likelihood of the household to not cover basic needs of all members
without engaging in irreversible coping strategies due to a lack of financial
resources. Criteria include indicators of food security and economic vulnera-
bility, as well as self-reported coverage of household basic needs (shelter,
WASH, education, non-food items, and so forth). Eight sector-specific vulner-
abilities are defined, including food security, economic vulnerability, educa-
tion, health, non-food items, protection, shelter, and WASH. A household is
classified into one of four vulnerability categories according to each of these
eight sectors, and the sector scores are then summed to produce a global vul-
nerability score.
   The Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF) Steering Committee2 in
Jordan defines vulnerability as the risk of exposure of Syrian refugee households
to harm, primarily in relation to protection threats, the inability to meet basic
needs, limited access to basic services, and food insecurity, and the inability of the
population to cope with the consequences of this harm. Furthermore, vulnerabil-
ity is considered to be multidimensional (it varies across physical space and
among and within social groups), scale dependent (with regard to time, space,
and units of analysis) and dynamic (the characteristics and driving forces of vul-
nerability change over time). Three layers of vulnerability also exist related to (1)
geographic location and proximity to services; (2) community/household level
factors such as access to services, community cohesion, safety, and security; and
(3) individual/household vulnerability based on UNHCR specific needs catego-
ries (similarly to the WFP categories). The VAF system is used to create a house-
hold hardship formula, which results in a score based on the sum of household
vulnerability levels (low, mild, moderate/high, and severe) within each of eight
sectors; more weight is given to food security and economic vulnerability scores.
Furthermore, the VAF Steering Committee makes a clear distinction between
welfare and vulnerability by stating that expenditure is a proxy for welfare but
not vulnerability. The VAF determines the vulnerability status of a case according
to the following criteria:

1.   Head of household gender/disability/under 18/over 60/divorced/widowed/
     separated
2.   Dependency ratio
3.   Involuntary household relocation
24                                    The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     4.    Expenditure/income gap/external assistance received
     5.    Coping strategy index/social safety net strength
     6.    Water availability
     7.    Excreta disposal system reliability/ratio of household members to functional
           latrines/latrine accessibility
     8.    Crowding index
     9.    Syrian identity document availability
     10.   Birth registration
     11.   Registration status
     12.   Food consumption score/dietary sources/food sources/breast feeding/infant
           nutrition
     13.   School attendance
     14.   Youth literacy and numeracy
     15.   Access to health services by target populations

        In this book and in chapter 3 in particular, we will use an economics’ interpre-
     tation of the vulnerability concept. This concept is relatively new in economics
     and the relevant literature is recent. The essential theory dates back to the work
     of Morduch (1994) on the economics of uncertainty and mostly explores the
     concept of risk. There is no unanimity in definitions and one can group research
     in this area under three groups: (1) vulnerability as inability to cope with risk; (2)
     vulnerability as the risk of poverty; and (3) vulnerability as expected poverty in
     the near future (Ceriani 2015). The World Bank does not have a unique defini-
     tion of vulnerability and loosely refers to the concept as the probability of being
     in poverty today or falling into deeper poverty in the future, thus covering defini-
     tions (2) and (3). In chapter 3, we will use the term vulnerability as defined in
     point (3) above.
        We can also distinguish between monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability.
     Again, some prefer the term economic and noneconomic vulnerability, but mon-
     etary and nonmonetary seem more precise concepts. When discussing vulnerabil-
     ity to poverty in the report we mostly refer to monetary vulnerability, which is
     what the World Bank and welfare economics usually refer to. We will refer to
     nonmonetary vulnerability when discussing nonmonetary dimensions of vulner-
     ability, such as many of the vulnerability indicators used by humanitarian orga-
     nizations. As for poverty and deprivation, vulnerability can be one-dimensional
     or multidimensional and the previous discussion on weights also applies in the
     case of vulnerability.


     Notes
      1. The term sector in this context refers to classification according to a subject or topic and is
         not equivalent to an economic sector (an area of the economy in which businesses share
         related products or services).

                               A Profile of Refugees

Introduction
Since the beginning of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, almost 4.3 million
refugees have been registered (as of November 17, 2015). This includes 2.1 mil-
lion Syrians registered by UNHCR in the Arab Republic of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
and Lebanon; 2.2 million Syrians registered by the government of Turkey; and
26,772 Syrian refugees registered in North Africa (UNHCR 2015a). Furthermore,
over 6.5 million Syrians are internally displaced (UNHCR 2015b). The scale and
impact of the spillovers from the Syrian conflict have had profound political,
economic, and social consequences for the neighboring countries.
    This chapter focuses on Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon and uses
UNHCR registration and household survey data to determine the refugees’
socioeconomic profile. A comparative analysis of Syrian refugees in Jordan and
Lebanon and the Syrian population before the crisis is undertaken to determine
whether Syrian refugees are systematically different in their socioeconomic pro-
files from the Syrian pre-crisis population. More specifically, this chapter concen-
trates on understanding the characteristics of the refugee population in terms of
their specific socioeconomic dimensions. Refugees are typically a self-selected
portion of a population with larger shares of women and children and atypical
family structures. This part of the report aims at understanding how different the
Syrian refugee population is compared to the Syrian pre-crisis population and
the hosting population for countries where data are available. Moreover, it will
be important to understand the human capital embodied in refugees, how this
human capital is eroded over time, and how the potential creation of new human
capital is hampered by the conditions in which refugees live. Loss of human capital
has long-term developmental implications and understanding the potential dimen-
sion of this loss can help to design policies that prevent or at least mitigate it.
    The chapter is organized as follows. The next section discusses macroeco-
nomic factors leading up to the Syrian crisis. Syria’s economic performance dur-
ing this “decade of shocks” showed encouraging and adverse results. The third
section presents a comparative analysis of the socioeconomic profile of the popu-
lations in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon before the Syrian crisis to help understand
if refugees in these countries differ from the “regular” population and, if so, in
                                                                                         27

     what dimensions. The fourth section provides a comparative analysis of socioeco-
     nomic dimensions of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon and the Syrian pre-
     crisis population with the aim to help understand what types of people had to
     flee and what their respective socioeconomic characteristics are. The final section
     concludes.


     Macroeconomic Factors Leading Up to the Crisis
     The factors leading up to the Syrian crisis were social, economic, and political in
     nature. This section provides a brief description of some of the key economic
     developments during the decade that preceded the crisis. The Syrian economy
     underwent a structural transformation and achieved substantial progress during
     the decade leading up to the crisis. Moving away from a contracting oil sector, non-
     oil sectors contributed positively to gross domestic product (GDP) and the role of
     the private sector increased considerably throughout the 2000s. The Syrian govern-
     ment introduced gradual market-oriented reforms to move to more diversified
     production driven by the private sector. It also experienced some significant chal-
     lenges in the forms of lagging per capita GDP growth compared to peer countries
     and growth that was not shared equally across its population (World Bank 2010).
         Syria’s transformation from an oil-dependent economy dominated by the
     public sector to a diversified economy driven by the private sector was, according
     the World Bank’s Economic Memorandum of 2010, achieved through steady
     market-oriented reforms implemented by the Syrian government in the 2000s.
     Non-oil GDP in total output grew from 70 percent in 2000 to almost 90 percent
     in 2009 while the oil sector contracted. The role of the private sector also sub-
     stantially increased through the liberalization of trade laws and increased private
     sector financing opportunities (World Bank 2010).
         At the outset of the 2000s, world growth rates averaged around 5 percent
     with relatively small differences between developed and emerging economies.
     The 2001 global financial crisis is associated with a visible decline in world out-
     put, affecting all groups of countries and reducing average growth rates by about
     2–3 percentage points. The decline in economic activity and sectoral growth hit
     the Arab world particularly hard in comparison to other low- and middle-income
     economies. For example, if we focus on the period 2000 to 2002, the group of
     countries that saw the largest decline are Arab countries (figure 1.1). After the
     economic downturn and starting from 2002, all groups of countries experience
     increasing growth rates up to the 2007 to 2008 global financial crisis. Figure 1.1
     also shows that Syria’s decline in output in 2000 was particularly stark, with a
     decrease in growth of 3.5 percent. However, Syria performed strongly particu-
     larly after 2004; between 2004 and 2007, Syria grew on average by 7.9 percent
     per year with broad-based growth of all non-oil sectors, led by construction and
     services (World Bank 2010).
         Even though Syria’s average annual growth in GDP was encouraging, Syria’s
     performance in average per capita GDP growth was less promising. GDP grew
     by 5.5 percent from 2000 to 2007 but GDP per capita only grew by 2.5 percent

(figure 1.2). Furthermore, during the same period, GDP per capita growth in
Syria was lower than in the Arab world (3.4 percent), low-income countries (3.1
percent), and middle-income countries (5.5 percent).
   Moreover, looking at growth rates throughout the global financial crisis of
2008, we find that the Syrian economy weathered the global financial crisis fairly
well with a growing economy; but the rate of GPD growth decreased between
2004 and 2010, coming to its lowest point in 2010 at 3.2 percent (figure 1.3).

                                This growth rate did not compare poorly relative to world average but it is the
                                deceleration of the economy which becomes of concern during the period.
                                   The decreasing growth rates observed between the two major worldwide
                                economic shocks of the decade coincided with drastic increases in oil and food
                                prices. As shown in figure 1.4, oil, food, and agricultural prices in general experi-
                                enced sharp growth during the 2004–08 period and then again after the 2007–08
                                global financial crisis. These increases were good news for producers but not for
                                consumers, a factor that likely played a role in the increasing social instability that
                                eventually erupted in the Arab Spring in 2011.
                                   Considering sectoral growth rates, we see that Syria experienced a decline in
                                the agricultural sector from 23.8 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2008 while

the service sector grew from 38.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 49.3 percent in
2008 (figure 1.5). Growth in the 2000s was largely driven by increases in private
consumption and to a lesser extent investment and government spending. The
services and agricultural sectors experienced increases in labor productivity while
industry registered declining productivity, which can be largely attributed to
declines in the oil, electricity, and water sectors (World Bank 2010).
   Syria has significant wealth in petroleum resources, which could have positive
consequences for the budget, as oil is a major source of government revenue
(SCPR 2013). However, figure 1.6 shows that Syria’s oil exports decreased over
time while imports increased. As a result, refined petroleum’s trade balance

     worsened over time with almost three times as much refined petroleum
     imported than exported in 2010 as compared to the beginning of the decade.
     According to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, Syria’s trade deficit has
     increased every year since 2006 with imports exceeding exports by 243 billion
     Syrian pounds (LS 243 billion) in 2010 (figure 1.7). Imports rose much more
     quickly than exports, with finished products contributing the most to this signifi-
     cant increase as extractive industries such as oil decreased significantly. Therefore,
     as the country did not take full advantage of increasing oil prices as a producer,
     the trade deficit worsened while consumers suffered from increasing prices
     across most commodities, including food.
        The global rise in food and agricultural prices also coincided with a severe and
     prolonged domestic drought between 2006 and 2009, a factor that is said to have
     contributed to the outbreak of the conflict in Syria (Kelley et al. 2015). About
     75 percent of the entire land area of Syria is used for agriculture but only 10
     percent of all agricultural land is irrigated (World Bank 2015). The lack of imple-
     mentation of urgently needed modern irrigation systems made the sector highly
     dependent on rainfall. Thus, when the drought hit Syria in the second half of the
     2000s, many farmers were not able to harvest for four consecutive years, and
     herders lost over 80 percent of their livelihood due to a lack of pasture and fod-
     der (Erian et al. 2011).
        The drought led to dire economic and social consequences, resulting in the
     dislocation and migration of hundreds of thousands of farm workers from the
     rural Northeast to the overpopulated and under-serviced cities. According to the
     IFRC (2010), 60 percent of Syria’s land and 1.3 million people were affected by
     the drought with just over 800,000 people having lost their livelihoods. “In the
     eastern governorates of Al Hassakeh, Deir-ez-Zor, Raqqah, Homs and Hama, the
A Profile of Refugees                                                                       33


drought has had an impact on almost the entire rural population. An area that
used to be the granary of Syria” (IFRC 2010). The dislocation of rural popula-
tions to cities decreased agricultural employment in Syria, affecting many
women, the vast majority of whom worked in occupations related to skilled
agriculture, forestry, and fishery (about 41.5 percent in 2007). In 2006, about 20
percent of all employment in Syria was provided by the agricultural sector; agri-
cultural employment declined to 5 percent within just four years.
   The internal migration of rural populations from the Northeast to urban cen-
ters served as a multiplier for social and economic pressures on a system already
burdened by a large influx of Iraqi refugees. The 500,000 refugees from Iraq (of
whom 225,000 were registered as refugees with the UNHCR) largely settled in
urban areas, where they contributed to steep increases in prices of consumer
goods, real estate, and increased demand for subsidized goods (IMF 2007).
Furthermore, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA 2011), over 500,000 Palestinian
refugees were registered in Syria in 2010, many of whom lived in camps. Syria’s
high population growth numbers (2.6 percent annually over the period 2001–
10) combined with a large influx of refugees led to increased pressure on scarce
natural and economic resources such as water, land, and jobs.
   Another challenge to the Syrian economy was the fact that growth was not
inclusive in the decade leading up to the crisis. Despite growth, job creation was
weak and Syria experienced an unemployment rate of 8.4 percent in 2010 with
large discrepancies in male (5.7 percent) and female (22.5 percent) unemploy-
ment (figure 1.8). The unemployment rates, which may not seem particularly
high, coupled with low labor force participation rates (particularly for females of
only 12.9 percent in 2010, figure 1.9), show that many Syrians did not contrib-
ute productively to the economy. In addition, figure 1.8 shows that young people

     faced stark challenges in the labor market with youth unemployment rates (19.2
     percent) almost four times as high as adult unemployment rates (5.3 percent)
     and young females suffering from an unemployment rate of 40.2 percent. Syria
     before the crisis had a very large young population and over 50 percent of all
     those unemployed were between 15 and 24 years old.
        Syria had also a very young and growing population. As discussed in more
     detail in the following sections, the country had almost 60 percent of the popula-
     tion under the age of 25. Furthermore, the labor force grew rapidly, a growth of
     36 percent from 2000 to 2008 according to the World Bank (2010). The demo-
     graphic pressure, coupled with an economy that was not able to absorb the
     young labor market entrants by providing productive employment opportunities,
     led to a high youth unemployment rate and brought along social and political
     risks. The analysis by the World Bank (2010) of the Syrian economy furthermore
     states that “reforms after 2004 led to improvements in growth and efficiency, and
     the role of the private sector expanded. However, increases in private investment
     did not lead to a boost in investment rates, which remain low by international
     standards. Key obstacles to inclusive growth in Syria are regulatory uncertainty,
     credit misallocation, protection rates that introduce considerable anti-export
     bias, and infrastructure bottlenecks mainly related to electricity.”
        Growth in Syria was neither pro-poor nor inclusive and the benefits of growth
     do not appear to have trickled down to the majority of Syria’s population.
     According to the Syrian Center for Policy Research (SCPR), “the vast majority of
     Syrian households incurred a decline in their real expenditure between 2004 and
     2009 due to the rise in commodity prices worldwide, local liberalizing of fuel and
     fertilizers prices, and poor market efficiency, all of which caused a considerable
     rise in prices and an erosion of purchasing power. In addition, data show a

considerable discrepancy between the various governorates with respect to aver-
age household spending” (SCPR 2013). Furthermore, the Syrian economy failed
to absorb new labor market entrants and the vulnerability of Syrians increased.
    In essence, it is clear that during the decade that led to the Syrian crisis, the
country suffered from multiple and repeated shocks despite decent growth rates,
good budget management, and an acceptable business climate. The positive fac-
tors did not contribute enough to achieve sustained increases in per capita GDP,
the creation of jobs, and the reduction in poverty. According to the SCPR (2013),
“the current crisis in Syria is rooted in ‘institutional bottlenecks,’ which marginal-
ized large segments of society and deprived them of effectively contributing to
the political, economic and social development.” The surge in the young popula-
tion (represented by the large increase of the proportion of young people within
the overall population), the migration of large parts of the population from rural
to urban areas, the unequal distribution of development across regions, and the
impossibility for many Syrians to attain a decent standard of living caused a deep
and prolonged crisis in Syria. Furthermore, institutional constraints also seemed
to have played a role.
    On balance, the negative factors dominated the positive ones (figure 1.10).
But what is most relevant for the analysis that follows is that millions of people
living in Syria at the time of the outbreak of the crisis in March 2011 had been
already on the move, including over a million Syrians who were internally dis-
placed by the drought and economic distress. Most of these people migrated to
areas that later became heavily affected by war and who eventually became refu-
gees in neighboring countries. Hence, the welfare and vulnerability analyses of
Syrian refugees that we will carry out in chapters 2 and 3 of this study are to be
understood in the context of a population that was already heavily affected by
economic hardship before the flight to neighboring countries.

     Comparing Syrians, Jordanians, and Lebanese before the Crisis
     To understand the challenges and opportunities that Syrian refugees face in their
     host communities in Jordan and Lebanon, it is vital to not only comprehend the
     socioeconomic profile of refugees, but also to compare it to the socioeconomic
     profile of their host communities’ populations. This section compares the socio-
     economic profiles of the populations of pre-crisis Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to
     understand if these populations were systematically different from one another
     before the crisis, in which dimensions, and what implications this may have.

     Age composition
     The age composition of the populations in Syria and Jordan were fairly similar in
     2010 with small proportions of the population (3 and 4 percent, respectively)
     over the age of 64 and about 35 percent of the population under the age of 15
     (table 1.1). Lebanon’s population on the other hand appears to be older on aver-
     age with a larger proportion of elderly people (8 percent) and a much smaller
     proportion of the population under the age of 15 (24 percent). The population
     growth rates for Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon are 2.4, 2.2, and 2.2 percent, respec-
     tively, and about 49 percent of the population is female.
        As a result of the age composition, dependency ratios were similar in Syria and
     Jordan, with Syria having the highest age dependency ratio of 65.2 percent while
     Lebanon has a lower overall dependency ratio encompassing a much larger share
     of the older population (figure 1.11).
        This difference in the age structure of Syrians, of which a subset are Syrian
     refugees, particularly compared to Lebanon, may create difficulties in terms of
     institutional frameworks and set-ups. Institutions or certain facilities (education,
     health care, and so forth) may not be set up to absorb such a large influx of a
     population that is so vastly different from the host communities’ populations.

     Education
     Jordan had higher enrollment rates1 for primary and secondary education than
     Syria and Lebanon while Syrian and Lebanese enrollment rates are fairly similar
     (figure 1.12). Considering educational enrollment, we assume that Syrian refu-
     gees will lag behind the enrollment rates of Jordan and presumably Lebanon
     when taking into account all refugee children, who currently miss out on

Employment
The labor force participation rates in Syria and Jordan are fairly similar, and both
had very low female labor force participation rates of 12.9 and 14.7 percent,
respectively, in 2010 (figure 1.13). In Lebanon, the female labor force participa-
tion rate in 2007 was higher at 19 percent. However, the overall labor force partici-
pation rate is similar in the three economies (44.2 percent in Lebanon in 2007
compared to 42.7 and 39.5 percent in Syria and Jordan, respectively, in 2010).

                           Employment patterns in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon differ substantially (see
                        more details in subsequent section). Table 1.2 shows that employment in the
                        agricultural sector accounts for only 3 and 6.3 percent of all employment in
                        Jordan and Lebanon, respectively, in 2009 while in Syria, 15.2 percent of the
                        employed work in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, the industrial sector has
                        much larger employment shares in Syria compared to Jordan and Lebanon.
                           The Syrian population differs in terms of composition and structure from the
                        populations in Jordan and Lebanon. Syrians tend to be younger, are more likely
                        to work in agriculture, and less likely to work in services. Structural differences
                        in the labor markets in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon will impact the opportunities
                        of Syrian refugees in their host communities regarding skills and employability.
                        Most Syrian refugees may not be qualified to work in the employment categories
                        sought after in the economies of Jordan and Lebanon. Lack of qualifications,
                        combined with tight restrictions to enter the Jordanian and Lebanese labor mar-
                        kets, will compel many refugees to move to low-paid and low-skilled employ-
                        ment. Another severe consequence is the resulting erosion in skills and
                        employability of Syrian refugees, which may affect the long-term development
                        trajectory of the Syrian economy after the crisis.

Socioeconomic Dimensions of Syrian Refugees in Jordan and Lebanon
The adverse socioeconomic factors leading up to the crisis in Syria included: (i)
the inability of the Syrian economy to create productive employment for youth,
worsened by demographic trends such as an increase of the proportion of young
people within the overall population; (ii) the migration of large parts of the
population from rural to urban regions due to the drought; (iii) the unequal
distribution of development across regions; and (iv) the challenge for some parts
of the population to attain a decent standard of living. How do refugees differ
from the Syrian pre-crisis population? What type of people had to flee? Is there
a systematic difference between refugees and a “regular” population? To gain an
understanding of the Syrian refugees’ population—which is a subset of the “regu-
lar” Syrian population—it is instructive to compare their socioeconomic profile
to the socioeconomic profile of the Syrian pre-crisis population. This comparison
provides clues as to the socioeconomic background Syrian refugees may have
come from and determine similarities and differences of refugees compared to
the overall Syrian population.
    There are three distinct groups of Syrians who have left the country as a result
of the crisis with presumably different economic and social means. Their com-
mon factor is that they cannot safely return to their place of origin. The first
group was forcibly displaced and stayed within the borders of Syria as internally
displaced persons (IDPs). The second group of people migrated as a result of the
conflict in search of economic opportunity elsewhere (non-refugee migrants).
The third group of people, also forcibly displaced, left Syria to register as refugees
in other countries.
    The SCPR (2015) estimated that there were 6.8 million IDPs in Syria at
the end of 2014, most of whom fled conflict zones or badly damaged areas
and resettled in safer areas within the borders of Syria. Most of these IDPs
left everything behind and are in need of basic services and assistance.
However, the SCPR (2015) estimates that the Syrian “government has been
able to provide shelters and support for less than 5 percent of IDPs, with the
majority residing in host communities throughout the country.” It is hard to
have an assessment of the welfare of these IDPs but it is evident that this group
of people faces economic hardship as well as being at risk of war, conflict, and
widespread violence.
    Non-refugee migrants leave Syria due to the conflict not as refugees but to
find regular work and residence in other countries. This group consists mainly
of middle-class professionals and wealthy Syrians who often left early on during
the conflict and have means and/or good connections to migrate as non-refu-
gees. The SCPR (2015) estimates that this group reached 1.55 million people
by the end of 2014.
    The third group of Syrians affected by the crisis are people registering as refu-
gees, often taking on risky journeys to get to neighboring countries to register
with the UNHCR. Refugees will either live (i) in refugee camps (official or unof-
ficial) or (ii) in host communities. Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan live for

                          the large part in host communities. There are no official refugee camps in
                          Lebanon and refugees are dispersed in local communities throughout the coun-
                          try. In Jordan, about 80 percent of Syrian refugees live in non-camp settings,
                          mostly urban areas in the north of Jordan. The other 20 percent live in the refu-
                          gee camps of Za’atari, Marjeeb al-Fahood, Cyber City, and Al-Azraq. The biggest
                          refugee camp in Jordan (Za’atari) holds over 80,000 registered refugees.
                             As of November 2015, 1,075,637 Syrian refugees were registered in Lebanon
                          and 633,644 were registered in Jordan (UNHCR 2015a). This study as well as
                          this chapter focus exclusively on non-camp refugees living in host communities
                          in Jordan and Lebanon and we cover a population of refugees of approximately
                          1.7 million people living in host communities. In the next section, we provide a
                          basic socioeconomic profile of this population.

                          Origin and destination of refugees
                          According to Abu-Ismail et al. (2011), overall poverty in Syria in 2007, measured
                          by the share of the population under an upper poverty line,2 stood at 33.6 per-
                          cent of the population (6.7 million Syrians). Furthermore, 12.3 percent of the
                          population were estimated to live in extreme poverty, measured by the share of
                          the population under a lower poverty line. Poverty has a strong spatial dimension;
                          poverty in Syria was concentrated mainly in rural areas (figure 1.14). This fact is
                          particularly stark in the Coastal and Northeast region, where poverty rates in
                          rural areas are 10 percentage points higher than in urban areas.

    Comparing these poverty rates to refugee outflows shows that just under a
third of all refugees comes out of the poorest Northeast regions of Idleb, Aleppo,
Ar-Raqqa, Al Hasakeh, and Deir-ez-Zor. This should not be a surprise. First, the
Syrian data are for 2007, a time when the drought had not reached its peak
crisis. In fact, what these statistics tell us is that the population affected by the
drought who later fled to the central cities of Syria already had a high poverty
incidence before and during the drought. Moreover, as shown below, the cities
to which the drought-related IDPs moved to are the same cities from which
refugees fled. This fact can indeed be verified, as refugees originating from these
Northeast regions have the highest incidence in poverty (for more details, see
chapter 5 of this report).
    Map 1.1 displays the density of all refugees leaving Syria by governorate who
registered with the UNHCR in either Lebanon or Jordan.3 About 65 percent of
all Syrian refugees in our data set went to Lebanon and about 35 percent to
Jordan. Due to proximity, the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees regis-
tered in Jordan come from Dar’a (47.1 percent), followed by Homs (16.4 percent)

                          and rural Damascus (12.9 percent). Just over 50 percent of Syrian refugees reg-
                          istered in Lebanon come from three governorates in Syria: Homs (21.4 percent),
                          Aleppo (20.5 percent), and rural Damascus (14.1 percent). What is interesting
                          to note here is that the place of origin did not necessarily determine the country
                          of destination. Syrians who had to flee from Homs or Damascus, for example,
                          went either to Lebanon or to Jordan with no apparent preference for one country
                          over the other.
                             The majority of refugees, about 85 percent, fleeing to Lebanon settled in three
                          governorates: Bekaa (36 percent), North Lebanon (25 percent), and Mount
                          Lebanon (25 percent). Chapter 5 of this report shows that Bekaa and North
                          Lebanon are also the regions hosting the poorest refugees. In Jordan, the majority
                          of refugees settled in the border governorates of Al-Mafraq (26 percent) and
                          Irbid (24 percent), followed by the governorate of the capital Amman (27 per-
                          cent) (map 1.2). Refugees fleeing to Jordan saw an even greater concentration
                          with the quasi-totality of refugees concentrating in four of the northern gover-
                          norates (Irbid, Al-Mafraq, Zarqa, and Amman).

Sex and age composition
The Syrian pre-crisis population in 20074 was very young but the Syrian refugee
population in 20145 is even younger and consists of a larger share of females than
the pre-crisis population; 52.2 percent of all Syrian refugees in Jordan and
Lebanon are females (figure 1.15). In the Syrian pre-crisis population about 11
percent of the population was between 0 and 4 years while only 4 percent of the
population was 65 years or older. The Syrian refugee population is younger and has
a larger share of young children (aged 0–4) of 19.4 percent while only 2 percent
of the refugee population is over 65 years. About 45 percent of the Syrian pre-crisis
population was under the age of 18 and about 73 percent was under the age of 35
against 54 and 81 percent, respectively, for the refugee population.
   Even though the Syrian refugee population is younger than Syrians pre-crisis,
curiously, there are fewer 15–24 year olds who registered as refugees in Lebanon
and Jordan compared to the pre-cwrisis population. This is particularly stark for
the male refugee population registered in Lebanon—a “dent” in the age pyramid
can be observed—only 13.1 percent of all Syrian male refugees are between 15
and 24 while 18.8 percent are in this respective age group of Syrian refugees in
Jordan and 22.5 percent in the Syrian pre-crisis population. This can be

                          attributed to several factors. For example, the way the registration is conducted
                          in Lebanon may be slightly different and refugees in that age group may have
                          fewer incentives to register as refugees with the UNHCR. However, this could
                          also mean that many individuals in this age group stay in Syria to engage in the
                          conflict or have been victims of the conflict.
                              The age composition of Syrian refugees poses several challenges. Understanding
                          the challenges that come along with such a young population is imperative to
                          recognizing the human capital embodied (or not embodied) in refugees, as this
                          may have long-term developmental consequences. Most refugees are children
                          who therefore have specific needs in terms of schooling, training, and health care
                          (physical and psychological). If refugee children do not go to school (and survey
                          data in Jordan and Lebanon led us to believe that many do not), human capital
                          cannot be built, with consequent long-term developmental implications.
                          Understanding the potential dimensions of this loss helps us to design policies
                          that prevent or at least mitigate these losses. Furthermore, the comparative analy-
                          sis of welfare and poverty of Syrian refugees in chapter 5 shows that the welfare
                          of refugees increases with the age of the household head. The younger the Syrian
                          refugee population, the younger the household head tends to be, and therefore
                          the poorer the household is expected to be.

                          Educational attainment
                          Educational attainment for Syrians in 2007 was bunched in the lower segments
                          with only 9.5 percent of the population with completed secondary education.
                          Syrian refugees have even lower levels of educational attainment than the Syrian
                          pre-crisis population. Discrepancies in male and female educational attainment
                          tend to be small for the aggregated educational groups displayed in figure 1.16.
                          About 86.7 percent of all Syrian refugees in Lebanon have primary education or

below while this percentage stands at 83.6 percent in Jordan.6 Fewer Syrian refu-
gees in Lebanon and Jordan have average institute degrees as compared to the
Syrian pre-crisis population (0.8 and 1.4 in Lebanon and Jordan and 3.8 percent
for pre-crisis Syrians, respectively), but university education is similar across the
three populations.
   Looking at educational attainment by broad age groups (figure 1.17) of the
working age population (15 years or more) shows that primary educational
attainment for young Syrians, those between 15 and 24 years, is lower than for
older Syrians (those 25 and older) but a higher percentage of younger Syrians has
completed secondary education. The Syrian population of 65 years and older has
much lower levels of education in all three populations (Syria pre-crisis, Syrian
refugees in Jordan, and Syrian refugees in Lebanon), which points to the fact that
Syria made substantial progress in educational attainment in the decades before
the crisis. Figure 1.17 also shows that Syrian refugees between 15 and 24 years
have higher levels of education than the Syrian pre-crisis population with higher
rates of secondary and university-level education.
   Comparing Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, we find that refugees in
Lebanon fare slightly worse in terms of educational attainment with only 13.3
percent of refugees with secondary education or above (figure 1.18). In Jordan,
11.2 and 19.5 percent have no education or completed the first stage of primary
education, compared to 7.3 and 21.7 percent, respectively, in Lebanon. Female
Syrian refugees in Lebanon (panel a) and Jordan (panel b) are more likely to have
no education (9.2 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively) compared to their

     male counterparts (5.2 and 8.2 percent, respectively). However, Syrian refugees
     in Jordan have a higher rate of secondary education (11.4 percent) compared to
     Syrian refugees in Lebanon (8 percent). The differences in educational attain-
     ment between refugees and the Syrian pre-crisis population could stem from the
     fact that the Syrian refugee population is much younger than the Syrian pre-
     crisis population and is therefore less likely to be of age for certain levels of
     educational attainment. Furthermore, refugees living in households where the
     household head has a higher level of education have a higher welfare on average
     than those living in households with a household head with lower levels of edu-
     cation (see chapter 5 for details).
        Considering the age of the large majority of Syrian refugees (almost half are
     under the age of 15), it is inevitably important to invest in their education, par-
     ticularly for children and young adults. In Jordan for example, official enrollment

children are enrolled in public schools across Jordan in the school year 2014/2015
(UNHCR 2015). However, our data show that there are a total of 297,014
school-aged children, those between the ages of 5 and 17. Furthermore, an
upcoming report by the WFP, UNHCR, and UNICEF (2015) shows that two-
thirds of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon did not receive any education and
44 percent of all children of school age (3–17 years) have not attended school for
at least one year. Figure 1.19 shows the educational pyramid of the Syrian pre-
crisis population and Syrian refugees, which tends to have become “flatter” from
pre-crisis Syrians to refugees, with a higher percentage of the refugee population
attaining primary education or below. We expect this educational pyramid to
become even flatter in the years to come as the gap to pre-crisis Syria will widen
if young refugees do not receive education in their host communities.

Marital status
The Syrian refugee population is much more likely to be single than the Syrian
pre-crisis population (figure 1.20). This presumably stems largely from the much
younger age of refugees and the fact that getting married can be very costly and
is therefore often not attainable for refugees. The conflict in Syria has also kept
many young adults at marriage age away from marriage. The marital status of
Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon is similar, with about a 10 percentage
point higher occurrence of single males compared to females and a higher per-
centage of married females compared to males.

        Syrian female refugees are married much younger than their male counter-
     parts. One percent of all female refugees is married under the age of 18 and 7.8
     percent are married between 18 and 24. As a percentage, this may not seem large,
     but 8,628 refugee girls under 18 are married. Looking at the percentage of all
     married refugee females (rather than all female refugees), those under the age of
     18 make up 2.7 percent and between 18 and 24, 20.9 percent. Out of all male
     refugees, 0.1 percent are married under the age of 18 and 1.5 percent under the
     age of 25. In comparison, only about 0.4 percent of all Syrian females are married
     under the age of 18 and 0.8 percent of all married females are under 18; for
     males, these percentages are both about 0.1 percent.

     Employment by occupation
     The registration database containing entries on refugees’ former occupational
     employment (in their country of origin) shows very large discrepancies in occu-
     pational employment compared to the Syrian pre-crisis population. Some 90
     percent of Syrian female refugees indicated that they were occupied as service
     and sales workers in their previous employment, whereas only about 8 percent
     of females were occupied as services and sales workers before the crisis (figure
     1.21). Furthermore, persons employed in skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery
     occupations, which were dominant forms of occupation before the onset of the
     crisis, are not widespread in Syrian refugees.
        These large discrepancies in employment by occupation are curious and could
     stem from various sources. First, refugees are a self-selected group that is not
     spread evenly across all occupations. It is possible, for example, that refugees are
     disproportionally represented by people who were occupied in the informal
     service sector. Second, women, whose labor force participation rate was very low
     in Syria, may have classified their household duties as service and sales work.
     Third, the registration database does not actually refer to former employment by

occupation but rather current employment by occupation (or a mix of the two).
Fourth, people who register (due to this stressful situation) may not answer
truthfully or with enough care. Finally, structural changes occurred in Syria
between the time of the Syrian survey in 2007 and the time of the beginning of
the crisis in 2011. Any of these possible explanations would require a more
detailed investigation with a focus on how employment is accounted for upon
registration.
   Large differences in the structure of the labor markets in Syria, Jordan, and
Lebanon exist (see previous section). Syrian refugees who worked in agriculture

     before the crisis will not be able to apply those skills to the labor markets in
     Lebanon and Jordan; agricultural jobs do not exist to the same extent they did in
     Syria as the agricultural sectors in Lebanon and Jordan are much smaller.
     Furthermore, Syrian refugees have tight restrictions on access to the Jordanian
     and Lebanese labor markets and are therefore constrained to pursue informal
     employment or work in the informal economy. Consequences of these dynamics
     are not only the immediate struggle for a livelihood, but also the long-term
     developmental challenges for Syrians and the Syrian economy at large. Syrian
     refugees’ employability is impeded through an erosion of skills and refugees may
     struggle to enter the Syrian labor market upon return to Syria after the crisis.
         Even though Syrian refugees in Lebanon are, upon registration with the
     UNHCR, allowed to enroll in public schools for free and have access to primary
     health care, a work permit is required to take up legal employment. An agree-
     ment between Syria and Lebanon exists that allows for free movement, employ-
     ment, and stay of nationals for both countries. However, the Lebanese
     government is reluctant to issue work permits (required to work legally at a cost
     to the applicant depending on the work category). Therefore, many Syrian refu-
     gees are forced to work illegally, often at much lower wages than Lebanese
     nationals (Sadek 2013; ILO 2014).
         In Jordan, refugees are granted access to public school and health care upon
     registration with the UNHCR. However, work permits that provide legal rights
     to employment in Jordan are virtually impossible to come by as they require
     proof that the specific skill set is unavailable in Jordanian candidates. Furthermore,
     certain professions and industries are strictly reserved for Jordanian nationals.
     The Jordanian Ministry of Labor estimated that about 160,000 Syrians work
     illegally in Jordan (mostly in Amman), many in the informal sector under hazard-
     ous conditions and low pay (Sadek 2013). The number of Syrian refugees with a
     work permit is much lower, about 6,000 in 2014, and the number of refugees
     who declared an income from work is low.
         The legal framework, skills mismatch between domestic labor demand and
     the supply of refugees’ skills, and low levels of education for most Syrian refugees
     result in precarious informal employment or employment in the informal sec-
     tor. These mismatches in the labor market situation of Syrian refugees have
     negative consequences for Syrians as their skills and qualifications erode over
     time and many end up in precarious and hazardous working conditions.
     Furthermore, the development trajectory of Syria will be impeded as returning
     Syrian refugees may not be able to contribute to the Syrian economy as they did
     before the crisis due to a loss in skills and employability.
         We observe that Syrian refugees are systematically different from the Syrian
     pre-crisis population but also from the populations in Jordan and Lebanon. The
     Syrian refugee population is much younger than either of their host countries’
     populations. There is also a clear divide in the levels of education between Syrian
     refugees and their host populations, with refugees having lower levels of educa-
     tion and many refugee children not attending school. Structural differences in
     the labor markets in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon will also impact the
A Profile of Refugees                                                                    51


opportunities of Syrian refugees in their host communities regarding skills and
employability. Most Syrian refugees may not be qualified to work in the employ-
ment categories sought after in Jordan’s and Lebanon’s economy. Lack of quali-
fications, combined with tight restrictions to enter the Jordanian and Lebanese
labor markets, will compel many refugees to move to low-paid and low-skilled
employment.
   Such a large influx of young Syrian refugees with specific needs in terms of
schooling, training, skills, and employability poses serious challenges on the host
communities’ populations, infrastructure, legal framework, and political systems.
Institutions or certain facilities (education, health care, and so forth) may not be
set up to absorb such a large population that is so vastly different from the host
communities’ populations. Increased attention is inevitable to assure that the long-
term challenges of both refugees and host communities are met with great care.


Conclusion
This chapter analyzed the economic situation of Syria before the onset of the
crisis to determine what impact it had on the Syrian refugee crisis. The distress
for Syrians did not start only at the onset of the crisis in 2011; it started a decade
earlier and is explained by a combination of global financial shocks and domestic
agricultural shocks. The positive development observed in terms of growth, bud-
get stability, and a favorable business environment were outweighed by the nega-
tive consequences of the economic shocks on trade, institutions, labor market,
social exclusion, and population welfare.
   Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, there have been over 6.5 million IDPs,
almost 4.4 million registered refugees, and 1.5 million non-refugee migrants
(UNHCR 2015a, 2015b). This amounts to about half of the pre-crisis Syrian
population. However, the outflow of Syrians was not even across socioeconomic
groups. Partly due to circumstances, partly due to self-selection, and partly due
to the evolving war pattern, the Syrian population that migrated has a different
socioeconomic profile from the Syrian pre-crisis population.
   This chapter focused on Syrian refugees who are registered with the UNHCR
and live among local communities throughout Jordan and Lebanon using
UNHCR registration and household survey data. A comparative analysis of
Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon and the Syrian population before the
crisis was undertaken to determine the socioeconomic profile of Syrian refugees
in Jordan and Lebanon as well as of the pre-crisis population in Syria. We deter-
mined that Syrian refugees are systematically different in their socioeconomic
dimensions from the Syrian pre-crisis population. Syrians are very young, but
refugees tend to be even younger—the Syrian refugee population has a larger
share of young children (aged 0 to 4) and people aged 25 to 34. Approximately
65 percent of all registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan are under the
age of 25 and about 19.4 percent of all refugees are infants under the age of 4.
This very young age structure points to the fact that large parts of the population
have specific needs, particularly for schooling and health care.

         Furthermore, the levels of education among Syrian refugees are lower than for
     Syrians before the onset of the crisis, with slightly higher educational attainment
     for Syrian refugees in Jordan compared to Lebanon. About 13.3 percent of all
     Syrian refugees in Lebanon have secondary education or above while this per-
     centage stands at 16.5 percent in Jordan.
         In terms of family status, the Syrian refugee population is much more likely
     to be single than the Syrian pre-crisis population and a higher percentage of
     Syrian refugee females are married compared to males. Syrian female refugees
     are also more likely to be married under the age of 18 than either Syrian females
     before the crisis or their male counterparts.
         Due to large differences in the structure of the labor markets in Syria, Jordan,
     and Lebanon, and tight labor market restrictions placed on Syrian refugees,
     Syrian refugees are often constrained to pursue informal employment or work in
     the informal economy. As a result, refugees not only face an immediate struggle
     for their livelihood, but also long-term developmental challenges as their skills
     erode and employability is at stake upon return to Syria after the conflict ends.
         Syrian refugees’ socioeconomic profile showed that they are systematically
     different from the Syrian pre-crisis and their host communities’ populations.
     Therefore, we conclude that refugees not only have large humanitarian needs,
     but also face critical development challenges. These challenges include: (i) the
     capacity of institutions in host communities providing basic services to accom-
     modate the different age profile of the Syrian refugee population—including
     specific needs for health care and schooling; (ii) the risk that refugee children will
     lag behind host country children in school enrollments and experience gaps in
     their education—and the long-term development impact of this loss of human
     capital; and (iii) the mismatch between the skills/occupations of Syrian refugees
     and the demand for labor in the Lebanese/Jordanian economies, resulting in a
     lack of employment opportunities and the consequent erosion in skills and
     employability of Syrian refugees. Furthermore, due to the unprecedented scale
     and duration of the current Syrian refugee crisis, a large burden is placed on host-
     ing communities. Attention therefore must be given to the perspective of hosting
     countries and the differences that exist between Jordan and Lebanon in terms of
     (i) social cohesion and (ii) the provision of public services to refugees. These two
     aspects should be taken into account when thinking about assimilation of this
     new population into the hosting countries. These development challenges
     require special and increased attention to assure that the long-term development
     trajectories not only of refugees themselves but of Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon as
     a whole are not irreversibly damaged.

    on non-food items for households whose expenditure on food is equivalent to the
    food poverty line. The lower poverty line adjusts the food poverty line by essential
    expenditures on non-food items.

    December 2014. Only those refugees whose status is “active” and excluding those
    whose arrival date to the respective country is earlier than January 1, 2011 were
    included in the analysis. This results in a data set of 609,285 Syrian refugees in Jordan
    and 1,112,546 Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

 6. The educational system in Syria is divided into a first stage of primary education
    including grade 1 through grade 4 and a second stage of primary education encom-
    passing grade 5 through grade 9. The statistics displayed above combine these two
    stages of primary education. Secondary education refers to education from grade 10
    through grade 12. The average institute follows secondary education and includes a
    two-year program (grade 13 through grade 14). University or more includes university
    and post-graduate degrees.

Introduction
This chapter provides a poverty profile of refugees from the Syrian Arab
Republic living in Jordan and an analysis of the main predictors of welfare and
poverty.1 The purpose of the poverty profile is three-fold. It provides a first indi-
cation of the socioeconomic characteristics of the poor, which helps to detect
poverty pockets of the population that aggregate analyses or welfare modeling
would miss. It helps to provide some useful indications of the important variables
that one should consider in a welfare model tailored to a refugee population and
it contributes to highlighting the dimensions that should be prioritized from a
policy perspective.
   The purpose of the welfare and poverty models is also multi-fold. First, we are
interested in identifying the main predictors of welfare and poverty for a popula-
tion of refugees. Second, welfare modelling can indicate how variables that are
already included in the ProGres (PG) data perform in terms of predicting welfare
and, consequently, we can learn about variables that are important for predicting
welfare but not already included in the PG data. Third, the welfare model can be
used to evaluate the targeting of the World Food Programme (WFP) aid and
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cash program.
Fourth, it can be used for developing a targeting approach based on a proxy
means test (PMT) or other methods. Fifth, it can be used to simulate alternative
policies toward refugees and test in advance of implementation the potential
welfare effects of these policies.
   As this is the first poverty and welfare assessment of a refugee population ever
undertaken by the UNHCR or the World Bank, we will take particular care in
describing the data sets used, the sampling and data collection procedures, the
unit of observation considered, the construction of the welfare aggregates, and
the choice of the poverty line. A refugee population evidently differs from a
regular population. Syrian refugees had to abandon, for the most part, their liveli-
hood and assets when they fled conflict in Syria and they have to rebuild or
develop a livelihood in a foreign country with few opportunities for work and
limited access to services. The nature of refugees’ deprivation is both financial

     and non-financial and requires reassessing welfare measures, poverty lines, unit of
     observations, and other measurement concepts that are now taken for granted
     when measuring poverty in a development context.
         This chapter shows that the Syrian refugee population in Jordan has clear
     predictors of welfare and poverty, including migration patterns; characteristic of
     the principal applicant (PA); housing, water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH); coping
     strategies; and protection indicators. These predictors can change if we focus on
     the entire distribution of cases or on the poor only and they can change according
     to the poverty line, but, overall, there is a set of indicators that is robust to any
     modelling. This set includes most of PG variables and a selected group of
     JD-HV2 variables including case size, paying rent, concrete housing, having elec-
     tricity, and being eligible for UNHCR assistance.
         The chapter is organized as follows. The next section discusses data in detail.
     The third section provides a poverty profile focusing on those variables that may
     be more of interest for a population of refugees. Here the objective is not to
     cover all possible angles of a poverty profile but rather to be very selective in
     highlighting important aspects related to refugee status. The fourth section pro-
     vides the results of the welfare and poverty models. This section is the result of
     a careful screening of all available variables and a final selection of the most rel-
     evant variables. The final section concludes.


     Data
     The chapter uses two data sets: the Profile Global Registration System (ProGres)
     and the Home Visits, round II (JD-HV2) data. Below, we describe each data set
     in turn.

     ProGres data
     The first data set is the Profile Global Registration System (ProGres). This is the
     main global database used by the UNHCR and the data provided include all
     registered refugees in Jordan as of December 2014. The value of this database is
     its size and the inclusion of key socioeconomic characteristics of refugees. Its
     shortcoming is that this database contains only selected variables and no variables
     measuring welfare. We call this data set “PG” in the remainder of the chapter. The
     PG data record all registered refugees and represent our reference population. Of
     course, not all refugees are registered; but due to immigration rules in hosting
     countries and UNHCR procedures and incentives to register, most refugees
     would register at some point in time.
         The PG data set includes all data collected during the first registration and
     those added during follow-up updates. Registration of new arrivals takes place in
     two urban UNHCR registration centers based in Amman (Khalda) and Irbid, and
     a third one at the Raba Sarhan joint GoJ/UNHCR registration center close to the
     Syrian border. This last registration center is where refugees crossing informal
     border points are registered. The UNHCR also organizes mobile registration mis-
     sions to remote areas and registers refugees in the two existing camps, Za’atari
Welfare and Poverty                                                                       57


camp and the Emirates Jordanian camp. Refugees belonging to the same family
are registered jointly as a case. A case is a processing unit, which is headed by a
principal applicant and includes its dependents.
   At registration, personal information for each individual is collected as well as
information relevant for the case. The data set collected as part of UNHCR
Jordan’s enhanced registration practice includes all relevant personal data such as
name, date of birth, place of birth, gender, date of flight, arrival date in Jordan,
registration date, ethnicity, religion, specific needs, and vulnerabilities. It also
includes a very short summary of the refugee claim; the whereabouts of close
relatives whether in country of origin, country of asylum, or other countries;
educational details; professional skills; occupation in country of origin and asy-
lum, if any; the addresses in country of origin and the country of asylum includ-
ing key movements within the country of origin; and reasons for flight. If refugees
have relatives who are registered refugees in Jordan, then the cases are linked.
   As a result of registration, UNHCR issues an Asylum Seeker Certificate with
12 months’ validity to registered persons of concern in the urban centers. Every
person of concern comes once a year to a UNHCR registration center for renewal
of the Asylum Seeker Certificate, and is then reverified once a year as part of this
process. The Asylum Seeker Certificate is used as a continuous registration
mechanism, whereby the information collected is reverified, validated, and
updated as appropriate, so as to maintain an updated profile of the refugees’
population. UNHCR Jordan also uses quality control and audit reports. The sys-
tematic and comprehensive use of audit reports at the registration stage is crucial
to achieving and ensuring high data quality and preventing fraud.

Home Visits data
The second data set is the Jordanian Home Visits database (JD-HV). The HV
data have been administered in Jordan in three successive rounds with improved
questionnaires. The first round (JD-HV1) was carried out in 2013 and termi-
nated at the end of October 2013. The second round (JD-HV2) was imple-
mented between November 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. JD-HV2 is the
round used for this analysis. The third round (JD-HV3) started as a pilot in July
2014 and it was still ongoing at the time of writing. The JD-HV2 data are a sub-
sample of the PG data.
   The JD-HV2 data collection process is not random and is designed for the
purpose of targeting. There are three criteria that are used to select cases for
Home Visits. The first relates to newly registered cases, which are all included by
default. The second relates to cases that are due for reassessment based on a
monthly list. The third relates to urgent cases, essentially cases that request a visit
for urgent needs. JD-HV2 covers approximately a third of the cases registered by
the UNHCR in the PG database. The JD-HV questionnaire results in almost 200
variables that can be used for analysis and includes questions on income and
expenditure, which we will use to construct our welfare aggregate.
   The final data set used in this paper joins both data sets PG and JD-HV2 using
the household (case) identification number. The JD-HV2 data are a subsample
58                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     of the PG data covering approximately a third of all registered refugee cases.
     Therefore, the final data set used includes all variables coming from both data
     sets but is limited to the size of the JD-HV2 data. We consider only cases outside
     refugee camps, since refugees in camps benefit from various types of assistance
     including shelter, free education, and free health care. Refugees living outside
     camps are all considered urban residents and there is, therefore, no need to split
     the analysis by urban and rural areas.
         JD-HV2 data are not necessarily representative of PG data because JD-HV2
     data are not a randomly selected sample of PG data. It is instructive, therefore,
     to test the differences between these two data sets. This is normally done by test-
     ing whether the means of the variables that are common to both the PG and
     JD-HV2 data are significantly different. T-tests, which are available in most sta-
     tistical packages, can do this. However, the structure of our data is particular and
     the t-test required is one that takes into account the fact that the JD-HV2 data
     are a subsample of the PG data. These are sometimes referred to as t-tests for
     partly overlapping groups and they are not usually available in standard statistical
     packages. The formula for this test is the following: let µi be the mean for group i;
     S(µi) the standard error of the mean of group i; group i the population (PG);
     group j the sample (JD-HV2); and p the proportion of cases in group j from
     group i.2 The t-test is shown in equation 2.1:


     (2.1)


     where T.025 is the 0.025 percentile in the t-distribution with n degrees of freedom
     (n being the sample size). The values of the t-distribution for the 0.025 percen-
     tile varies between 12.71 (1 degree of freedom) and 1.96 (1,000 degrees of
     freedom). Our t-statistics has to be larger than these values for the means
     between the population and the sample to be statistically different. Given the
     large number of observations that we have, we have also very large degrees of
     freedom, so that a value of 1.96 applies as a threshold.
         Table 2.1 reports results for key variables that are common in the PG and
     JD-HV2 data. Only five of the 22 variables considered show a t-statistic smaller
     than the threshold 1.96, indicating that the two populations contained in PG and
     JD-HV2 data are statistically different across several dimensions. This is particu-
     larly true for the spatial distribution in certain governorates of origin or destina-
     tion, for skills, case size, and cases with more than three children.
         It is possible to adjust the JD-HV2 sample to the PG characteristics through
     a process known as “raking,” where one attempts to correct the JD-HV2 sample
     means based on the PG sample means through a process of re-weighting the
     JD-HV2 data. However, correcting the JD-HV2 means has several drawbacks.
     The first is that when we correct for the mean of one variable and re-weight the
     JD-HV2 sample, all other means are affected. The second is that those factors
     that show the highest differences between JD-HV2 and PG data (such as place

of origin and destination or case size) are expected to be better recorded in
JD-HV2 data. That is because the PG interview is the first for refugees when
they enter the country; it is short and conducted under great pressure, especially
during the periods of high refugee inflows. JD-HV2 data, instead, are collected
during lengthy interviews in a more relaxed environment, when refugees have
already settled. Moreover, the date of registration of this information is different
for PG and JD-HV2 data with JD-HV2 data being subsequent to PG data.
During the period between the two interviews, cases’ conditions may have
changed—for example, a reunion with an additional child. This may explain
some of the differences that we observe between PG and JD-HV2 means. A
third reason for using JD-HV2 data as they are is that variables that are collected
only with JD-HV2 interviews relate better to JD-HV2 than PG data, as they are
evidently collected at the same time. Therefore, our final decision was to keep
the JD-HV2 data intact on the assumption that they are more representative
than PG data of the population of refugees.3

     Unit of observation
     The unit of observation used by the study is the “case,” the UNHCR unit used to
     register refugees. The UNHCR defines a case as: “A processing unit similar to a
     family headed by a Principal Applicant. It comprises (biological and non-biological)
     sons and daughters up to the age 18 (or 21) years, but also includes first degree family
     members emotionally and/or economically dependent and for whom a living on their
     own and whose ability to function independently in society/in the community and/or
     to pursue an occupation is not granted, and/or who require assistance from a care-
     giver.” The case identifier is present in both PG and JD-HV2 data and interviews
     for both data sets are conducted at the case level. The PG data also collect infor-
     mation on individuals who are part of a case.
        For other purposes, the UNHCR also defines “household” and “family.” A
     household is a group of persons (one or more) living together who pool their
     resources, make common provisions for food or other essentials for living/sur-
     viving, and where the members are dependent on each other and all trying to
     meet their combined set of needs. A family includes members of a household
     who are related to a specific degree through blood, adoption, or marriage. The
     degree of relationship used in determining the limits of the family is dependent
     on the uses (common in the area of intervention and/or UNHCR) and cannot
     be defined on a worldwide basis. Throughout this chapter, we will focus exclu-
     sively on cases.

     Welfare aggregates
     The first problem to address given the available data was the construction of the
     main welfare aggregate to be used for the welfare model. The JD-HV2 data
     contain three questions on welfare, one question on income structured in seven
     items, and two questions on expenditure, the first structured in six items and the
     second structured in ten items. Questions on income and expenditure refer to a
     recall period of one month prior to the interview. These questions are not ideal.
     It is known that values reported for income and expenditure decrease as the
     number of items listed in questions decreases and as the recall period increases.
     A recall period of 30 days is fairly long and six or ten items for expenditure ques-
     tions are not many. Therefore, we expect income and expenditure figures to be
     underestimated compared to their true values.
         However, in the context of a refugee population, under-reporting due to long
     recall periods and short lists of items may be less problematic than for a regular
     population. A refugee population is likely to be endowed with less resources than
     a regular population; the variety of consumption items is often reduced and so is
     the frequency and amounts of purchases. Many refugees live on humanitarian
     assistance and this often reduces the frequency, amounts, and variety of con-
     sumption. Also, the question of under-estimation is problematic for distributional
     analyses if the pattern of under-estimation varies across the distribution—if, for
     example, rich and poor households under-report expenditure by different
     degrees. There is little evidence of this phenomenon occurring for regular popu-
     lations, although it is known that richer households are less likely to participate
Welfare and Poverty                                                                     61


in surveys. We should also expect this phenomenon to be more limited for a refu-
gee population because of the reasons already cited for under-reporting and
because households are visited to establish eligibility for the UNHCR cash assis-
tance program. The program is of interest to households and this makes the non-
response rate in the Home Visits data an almost negligible issue.
   Given the considerations above, under-reporting is expected to be problem-
atic when we estimate statistics that are mean dependent such as mean expen-
diture or the poverty rate; but they are less problematic for statistics that are not
mean-dependent such as the Gini inequality index. It is also possible to test how
statistics perform under mean changes by using, for example, different poverty
lines or stochastic dominance analysis. By performing these sensitivity tests, we
overcome the problem of exact estimate of the welfare aggregate and also the
normative problem of selecting a particular poverty line for the analysis.
   To make the most of the data available, we constructed a unique expenditure
aggregate based on the two expenditure questions available. On the assumption
that replies to both questions were under-reported, this was done by taking the
highest reported value for each of the items common to both expenditure ques-
tions and the highest value of the rest of the items combined together. This new
expenditure aggregate resulted in an average increase of JD 10 per case per
month as compared with the higher of the two other expenditure measures.
Next, on the assumption that expenditure includes expenditure made with
UNHCR cash assistance, we created an additional expenditure item by subtract-
ing UNHCR cash assistance from all cases that were receiving this assistance at
the time of the visit. This last assumption was checked by comparing expendi-
ture of those receiving UNHCR cash assistance with the expenditure of those
not eligible and also by exchanging information with UNHCR and WFP staff.
This last expenditure aggregate was then selected as the main welfare aggregate
for the analysis. It is important to note that expenditure deducted by UNHCR
cash grants is not equal to expenditure in the absence of UNHCR cash grants.
Possibly, households would consume more (out of savings, increased labor supply,
and so forth), were they not recipients of aid. Therefore, we are not taking into
account behavioral effects due to the UNHCR cash assistance program. It is also
important to note that expenditure does not include the value of the WFP food
voucher as confirmed by the interviewers we spoke to. That is because the food
voucher is exchanged directly for goods.
   With the caveats discussed above, we are now ready to explore the welfare
aggregates in more detail. We focus on three aggregates: income per capita,
expenditure per capita derived from the two expenditure questions discussed,
and this last measure net of the UNHCR cash assistance. Figure 2.1 shows the
structure of the three distributions by positive values, zero values, and missing
values as found in the available data. Income per capita has 16.1 percent of miss-
ing values and 39.2 percent of zero values. The missing values are people unwill-
ing to reply, while the large share of zeroes is due to households who have
declared to have no income. This is expected in a refugee population living in a
country like Jordan where refugees do not work for the most part. Expenditure

                          per capita has no zero values, as expected, while expenditure per capita net of
                          UNHCR cash assistance has 2.1 percent of zero values. These are household
                          cases that essentially rely only on UNHCR cash assistance for living. The welfare
                          assessment that follows will rely on this last variable. We are therefore assessing
                          welfare in the absence of UNHCR cash assistance and WFP food voucher.
                             Table 2.2 provides the summary statistics for the main welfare aggregates.
                          Income per capita including the zero values is JD 34.75 per month, while it is
                          JD 65.23 if we eliminate the zeroes. Income is clearly under-reported. Of the
                          25,288 cases that report a positive income, 16,852 have an income smaller than
                          expenditure (66.6 percent). This is typical of household surveys in developing
                          and emerging economies, so much so that expenditure is usually used as the best
                          proxy for income, which is what we do in this chapter. However, even if income
                          is under-reported, the average income per capita for positive values is JD 65.23
                          per month, not far from the JD 77.8 per month of expenditure per capita.
                          Hence, cases that manage to have an income are closer to matching the average
                          expenditure per capita needs. Table 2.2 also shows that the UNHCR cash assis-
                          tance program contributes, on average, to JD 7.35 per capita per month.

   To test the various welfare aggregates in terms of conformity with theory and
empirics, we plotted the distributions of the natural logarithm functions of
income (Inc/cap with UNHCR cash) and expenditure with (Exp/cap with
UNHCR cash) and without (Exp/cap without UNHCR cash) UNHCR cash
assistance. Figure 2.2 illustrates the results. As a rule of thumb and according to
theory, a distribution of log-income or log-expenditure should have a regular
“bell” shape with few observations on the two tails of the income or expenditure
range and more observations as one approaches its central moments (mean and
median). This theoretical statement is based on probabilistic theory and is also
consistent with empirics. For example, if one plots income or expenditure distri-
butions using each of the 1,800 plus surveys available at the World Bank, the
greatest majority of these distributions would be bell-shaped.
   This is also what we find with the expenditure aggregates constructed from
the JD-HV2 data. The aggregates with and without UNHCR assistance are
clearly bell-shaped with a saddle point around a value of 4 (ln JD). This is much
less the case for income, the distribution of which is extremely irregular. We can
also observe that the expenditure aggregate net of UNHCR cash assistance is
more regular and a less narrow distribution as compared to the expenditure aggre-
gate that contains UNHCR cash assistance. This visual exploration of the income
and expenditure distributions confirms that the constructed measure of expen-
diture net of UNHCR cash assistance is the best choice given the available data.
   One should also keep in mind that welfare models typically utilize ordinary
least square (OLS) regression as estimators. These estimators perform

     particularly well if the dependent continuous variable such as income or expen-
     diture has a bell-shaped distribution. In fact, this is one of the requirements of
     OLS models. Therefore, a bell-shaped distribution serves both the purpose of
     confirming what we should expect in a welfare distribution, and the purpose of
     satisfying the basic requirements of an OLS model.
        The expenditure aggregate may also include expenditures financed by dona-
     tions not provided by the UNHCR. In addition to UNHCR cash assistance, refu-
     gees receive WFP food vouchers and occasional assistance in-kind or in cash by
     many different local and international organizations. The UNHCR tries to keep
     track of these donations but does not have a full record for each case. This means
     that, for some cases, the expenditure measure could include other donations in
     cash. The JD-HV2 questionnaire contains questions on non-financial assistance
     and we will use these questions to control for these donations. Looking at the
     UNHCR records of financial donations from other organizations and following
     consultations with UNHCR and WFP staff, we concluded that the additional
     cash received by all other organizations combined is small; but this could not be
     validated with data that cover all these financial donations as they are nonexis-
     tent. As already mentioned,the WFP voucher provided to cases is not accounted
     for in either income or expenditure. However, we cannot totally exclude that
     some cases reported expenditure financed by donors who did not record dona-
     tions with the UNHCR.

     Poverty lines
     For the purpose of the poverty profile and poverty models, we adopt a poverty
     line of JD 50/capita/month. This is the poverty line adopted by the UNHCR for
     providing cash assistance. This line is equivalent to US$71 and US$160 at pur-
     chasing power parity (PPP) per capita per month (2013 prices). In per day
     equivalent, the U.S. dollar PPP value is US$5.25, which is significantly higher
     than the international poverty line of US$1.25 (see table 2.3). As Jordan is a
     middle-income country, this poverty line is not unreasonable, also considering
     that the national poverty line used by Jordan around the same period was
     JD 78.3 (US$250 per month or US$8.2 per day at PPP value).
        A poverty line of JD 50/capita/month results in a poverty rate of 52.5 percent
     for cases and 69.2 percent for the population. To test how sensitive the poverty
     rate is to the chosen poverty line, we plot poverty rates by different poverty lines
     in the range between JD 0 and JD 100. Figure 2.3 shows the results. It is clear
     that the poverty rate is very sensitive to the poverty line, especially if we consider

the share of population as opposed to the share of cases. For example, poverty
lines of JD 40 and JD 60 lead to individual poverty rates of 55.9 and 78 percent
respectively, which is a large change compared to the figure of 69.2 percent
obtained with the JD 50 poverty line. Hence, for the purpose of targeting, it is
important to keep in mind that inclusion and exclusion rates could change very
significantly depending on the chosen poverty line.


Poverty Profile
In this section, we provide a poverty profile of Syrian refugees living in Jordan
based on selected indicators. Poverty profiles rely essentially on cross-tabulations
or graphs of poverty by socioeconomic characteristics of the population. As such,
one could derive poverty rates for hundreds of population groups. In this section,
we will focus on those characteristics that may matter more for the welfare
model and from a policy perspective, such as education and occupation. We
divide this analysis into three parts: migration patterns, characteristics of the PA,
and characteristics of the case.

Migration patterns
Syrian refugees follow particular trajectories depending on where they flee from
and where they are able to finally settle in hosting countries. These trajectories
can reveal something about differences in poverty, given that both places of ori-
gin and destination can be characterized by different living conditions. Table 2.4
provides poverty rates by governorate of origin in Syria and governorate of des-
tination in Jordan (empty cells show where the number of cases observed was
below 50). It is visible, for example, that Tafilah is the governorate in Jordan that

shows the highest poverty rates (85 percent) while Amman is the governorate
with the lowest poverty rate (59 percent). In terms of origin in Syria, Ar-raqqa is
the governorate that shows lowest poverty (46 percent) while Hama is the one
with the highest poverty rate (83 percent).
   It is also possible to identify the trajectory that leads to the highest poverty
rates. Refugees coming from Aleppo and Damascus governorates and going to
Tafilah are among the poorest with over 90 percent poverty rates. Recall that
many among these refugees had been already displaced before the crisis due to
the persistent drought in Northeast Syria. Poor agricultural workers moved to the
urban centers such as Aleppo and Damascus in search of work during the years
that preceded the popular uprising and this internal migration contributed to the
impoverishment of this group of the population even before the crisis. This may
explain in part the higher poverty rates observed for people who followed certain
trajectories in addition to the general living standards of the governorate of origin
and destination.
   Another useful angle is to look at the time of entry into the country and the
time of the Home Visit. The refugee influx has followed different phases that are
depicted in the top panel of table 2.5. Some of the refugees who would later
register with the UNHCR entered Jordan before the Syrian crisis. This is the
group labelled “Before 15 March 2011” and they represent about 2 percent of all
registered refugees. The influx of refugees followed a slow process in 2011 with
less than 5 percent of total registered refugees coming into Jordan during the
year. The period between January 2012 and November 2013 saw the peak influx
of refugees, with almost 87 percent of all refugees coming in during this period.
We use November 2013 as a cut-off point for 2013 because this is when the

                          JD-HV2 data started to be collected. The top panel of table 2.5 also shows that
                          the distribution of refugees across columns for each time period of entry is rather
                          homogeneous, meaning that there is no particular association between time of
                          entry and time of Home Visit.
                             The poverty rate of the different groups follows some clear patterns. The
                          group that entered Jordan before the Syrian crisis and the latest group of entrants
                          have the lowest poverty rates, while the peak of poverty is associated with those
                          who entered in 2012. By the beginning of JD-HV2 (November 2013), the pov-
                          erty rate for those who entered the country after November 2013 declined to a
                          level similar to pre-crisis refugees. This may be explained by the fact that those
                          late entries are probably people who did not need to flee immediately and had
                          initially more resources and opportunities to stay in Syria.
                             More insights can be drawn from looking at the point of entry and the formal
                          status of refugees (table 2.6). The majority of refugees entered the country infor-
                          mally (57.5 percent) and one can also see that few refugees entered informally
                          by air (forged documents). As one would expect, refugees who entered Jordan
                          informally suffer from higher poverty irrespective of the point of entry with a
                          difference in poverty rates of almost 18 percentage points. We can also see that
                          poverty is associated with the point of entry. Poverty is the highest for Ruwaished
                          and Hadallat (77.4 percent) and Tal Shihab (Sud) (75.6 percent). However, this
                          difference is almost entirely explained by formal entries. For those who entered
                          informally, the point of entry makes little difference in terms of poverty. Informal
                          entrants invariably have higher poverty rates.

                          Characteristics of the principal applicant
                          A first snapshot of poverty is provided in figure 2.4, where we plot poverty rates
                          for different population groups according to the characteristics of the PA. Results
                          are largely as expected but with some peculiarities to be attributed to the fact that
                          this is a refugee population of mostly non-employed people, at least formally.
                             Highly skilled people have a lower poverty rate than low-skilled people but
                          the difference is not as large as we would expect in regular populations. Similarly,
                          white-collar workers and people with eight years or less of education have lower
                          poverty rates than white-collar workers and higher educated people but the

differences are also not very large. These small differences are explained by the
fact that education and occupations (occupations refer to the pre-crisis status)
have small returns due to the fact that most refugees do not work. Refugees have
great difficulty in obtaining a work permit and are forced to either not work or
work informally for low wages. However, even though higher educational attain-
ment currently does not have an impact on labor market outcomes, investment
in education should be seen more broadly and education returns should not be
measured in terms of poverty in the short term (for example, children are kept
out of the streets and Syrians may be able to capitalize on educational attainment
upon return to Syria).
   Religious and ethnic status make a large difference with non-Muslims and
non-Arabs being less poor than their counterparts. However, non-Muslims and
non-Arabs are very small groups (0.4 and 1.0 percent of the total of refugees,
respectively) and these statistics are therefore less reliable. The time of interview
shows a small difference, with the people interviewed earlier showing higher
poverty (not shown here). Finally, male-headed households have higher poverty
than female-headed households, although the difference is only three percentage
points. This phenomenon can have multiple explanations, including the possibil-
ity that women are more accurate in reporting expenditure than men, or that
female heads of households have husbands who shuttle across the border or
work elsewhere to provide for their families. Recall that the PA is the person

                          interviewed who registered the case and not necessarily the head of household if
                          this head does not live with the household regularly.
                             We may want to dig deeper in the characteristics of the PA with the aim of
                          identifying poverty pockets otherwise little visible in statistical and econometric
                          analyses. Table 2.7 cross-tabulates age and marital status groups of the PA. The
                          top panel on population shares shows that married PAs below the age of 18 are
                          about 0.3 percent of the population. This is a small group in percentage terms
                          but a sizable group in numbers (about 650 cases). The largest group is repre-
                          sented by people who live in a case with a PA married or engaged and in age
                          group 35–49, followed by the respective 19–34 group. Other groups by marital
                          status are not large. Poverty (bottom panel) is the highest for the age group
                          35–49, presumably because this is the group with the largest number of children
                          of young age. For the same reason, poverty is also higher for married and engaged
                          people as opposed to other marital status group. Single people have the lowest
                          poverty rate and this seems to apply also to people aged 50 and above.
                             Table 2.8 provides population and poverty statistics by the former occupation
                          of the PA and the current level of education of the PA. The largest group by
                          former occupation of the PA are clerical, service, and sales workers at over a third
                          of the total Syrian refugee population; this is followed by craft and related trades
                          workers. In general, poverty increases as we pass from white-collar types of occu-
                          pations to blue-collar types and the highest poverty rate is found among skilled
                          agricultural workers. The largest group by current highest educational level
                          attained are those with 6–8 years of education, almost half of the population,
                          and this group is, somehow surprisingly, also the one with the highest poverty
                          rate. We can also find cells with extreme poverty rates such as skilled agricul-
                          tural workers with 9–11 years of education, where the poverty rate reaches

almost 81 percent. Hence, agricultural workers who were particularly affected by
the drought in Syria before the crisis remain the poorest population group
among refugees.

Characteristics of the case
As we will see in the welfare model, case size and the share of children in the
case are important predictors of welfare and poverty; this is a common result
among poor populations. One interesting question, however, is whether the case
size or the number of children is more relevant. Table 2.9 plots case size against
the number of children in the case. It is interesting to note that while the average
case size is 3.7 persons per case, the largest share of refugees (60.6 percent) lives
in cases with five or more people. That is because, of course, one six-person case
weighs the same as six one-person cases in the population. We can also see (bot-
tom panel) that the people living in larger cases (five persons and more) have
also, by far, the highest poverty rates. The poverty rate also jumps very signifi-
cantly for each additional case member and for each additional child. For exam-
ple, from one to two members, the poverty rate jumps from 12.5 percent to 22.4
percent and it jumps from 39.8 percent to 57 percent from one to two children.
It is also noteworthy that for a few cases, the case size is equal to the number of
children. These are all-children cases. Overall, both case size and number of

                          children are important and it is not possible to say with certainty which of the
                          two factors is more important. This question will be addressed in the multivariate
                          welfare and poverty models.
                             Children of school age are expected to be in school but refugee children face
                          many challenges in enrolling in educational institutions due to scarce supply,
                          financial constraints, crowding, psychological distress, and other issues that would
                          not normally exist for children in regular populations. Only about half of Syrian
                          refugee children in Jordan attend school despite the fact that Jordan provides
                          free education to refugees. It is therefore instructive to see the proportion of
                          children in school according to the number of children of school age and the rela-
                          tive poverty rates. Table 2.10 shows the results.
                             About a third of the refugee population lives in cases with no children of
                          school age. The numbers on the diagonal of the top panel of table 2.10 indicate
                          the population shares of people living in cases where all children attend school.
                          This is about 66 percent of the total population. In the rest of the population, at
                          least one child is not attending school. For example, 3 percent of the population
                          lives in cases with four school-age children of which none goes to school and 2.7
                          percent of the population lives in cases with five or more children of school age,
                          none of whom attend school. Poverty rates somewhat reflect these deficiencies.
                          The highest poverty rates are found for this last case of five or more children
                          where the quasi-totality of the population living in this type of case is poor (97.9
                          percent). The highest poverty rates are indeed found for the population living in
                          cases with many children and where several children do not attend school (bot-

   Of course, children out of school are more at risk of child labor and this is
what we explore next in table 2.11. About 3.6 percent of the population lives in
cases where at least one child is working. This is likely to be a lower-bound esti-
mate, as child work is one of the questionnaire items that is most likely to be
under-reported because of shame or legal issues. Interestingly, the largest share of

74                                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     the population living in cases with working children is where only one child is
     not attending school. The poverty rate is the highest for the population living in
     cases with four and more children out of school and working. These are evidently
     households that cannot afford to send any children to school, as they are engaged
     in work to support their families.
        Next, we look at contractual arrangements and type of accommodation as
     these may be good indicators of poverty (table 2.12). A majority of refugees live
     in cases with a contract arrangement of 7–12 months (60.3 percent). Over half
     of these people live in apartments as opposed to cement houses or makeshift
     accommodations. Those living in makeshift accommodations do not usually have
     a contract but the column “makeshift” shows that some do. Poverty is higher for
     those living in makeshift accommodations, houses, and apartments in this order.
     Evidently houses are not villas but single houses made of concrete situated in
     urban areas. For those living in apartments, poverty is higher if the contract dura-
     tion is longer. This is not surprising given the fact that in Jordan, rent is customar-
     ily paid in advance. Therefore, if refugees sign a lease for 12 months, they will
     have to make the payment for the entire rental period in advance, which could
     decrease their current expenditures and result in higher poverty.
        As a last exercise, we provide a basic profile of quintiles to show what the
     “prototype case” would look like by level of welfare (table 2.13). A typical poor
     case (first quintile), would be composed of almost seven people, and would be
     headed most likely by a male who is married with low education and around the
     age of 40. About 60 percent of the case members would be children, with five
     or six children attending school. The case would most likely come from Dar’a,

Homs, or Hama governorates in Syria and settling in Irbid, Amman, or Mafraq in
Jordan and having arrived in the country informally. On the contrary, a typical
non-poor case (fifth quintile) would be headed by someone who is much less
likely to be married, who is better educated, a bit younger, and living in a case made
of only two people with the unlikely presence of children. The provenance and
destination of the case, the skill level of the PA, and the probability of being headed
by a female would not be a factor that clearly distinguishes poor and rich cases.


Poverty Predictors
In this section, we study the possible predictors of welfare and poverty. We first
describe the models, estimators, and the variable selection process we follow to
optimize the final models. Next, we present the results for the welfare model,
providing details on each key predictor and their explanatory power. In the last
part, we present the results of the poverty models and compare different estima-
tions under different poverty lines and sets of predictors.

Models
As already stressed in the Data section at the beginning of this chapter, the
JD-HV2 and PG data can be merged into one data file using the UNHCR iden-
tification code. This results in a file where all observations (cases) have informa-
tion coming from the PG data set and a subsample (approximately a third) of
observations has information coming from the JD-HV2 data set. As a conse-
quence, only about a third of the cases registered has information on income and
expenditure.

       Central to the various objectives set in this chapter is the estimation of the
     welfare and poverty models that best exploit the JD-HV2 and PG data available.
     The general models are described as follows:

     (2.2)

     (2.3)

     where Wi =welfare measure (income or expenditure) and Pi = poor where Pi = 1
     if the case is under the poverty line and Pi = 0 if the case is on the poverty line
     or above; PGHV = the vector of case characteristics present in both the PG and
     the JD-HV2 databases; PG = vector of case characteristics present in the PG data
     but not in the JD-HV2 data; HV = vector of case characteristics present in the
     JD-HV2 data but not in the PG data; εi = normally distributed error term with
     zero mean; and i = case. As Wi is only available in JD-HV2 data, the total number
     of observations on which the model can be run is equal to the total number of
     observations in the JD-HV2 data.
         If JD-HV2 data are perfectly representative of the PG population of refugees,
     then the statistics produced from the JD-HV2 sample will be representative of
     the refugee population and there is no need to use cases in PG that are not
     included in the JD-HV2 data set. If, vice versa, JD-HV2 data are not representa-
     tive of the refugee population, then one may want to consider imputing the
     missing welfare values using information from other variables common to the PG
     and JD-HV2 data sets. In the Data section, we showed that we have good reasons
     to believe that the data set most representative of the refugee population is the
     JD-HV2 data. Therefore, no welfare imputations will be necessary and we will
     work with JD-HV2 observations only for welfare modeling.
         The objective of this section is to maximize the explanatory power of the
     models. For this purpose, we followed a systematic approach.4 First, variables at
     the individual level (like level of education) were aggregated at the household
     (case) level by choosing the values from the household head (PA). Second, vari-
     ables representing counts per household (like number of children in school) were
     transformed into case variables by dividing for the case size. Third, dummy (0/1)
     variables were created for the remaining categorical variables. Fourth, the
     remaining count variables were transformed into dummies so as to use only dum-
     mies in the final model. Using only binary (dummy) variables in the model has
     the advantage of avoiding the problem of finding the right nonlinear transforma-
     tion for continuous variables and also indicates more precisely the population
     category considered.
         To select the final welfare model, each variable was individually regressed on
     the main log-transformed per capita welfare aggregate. Variables were selected if
     they were able to explain more than 1 percent of the variance of the welfare
     aggregate (R2 >0.01) and were not missing in most cases. The list of selected
     variables was further refined through the means of a backward stepwise selec-
     tion, in which we choose the value of 0.01 as significance level for removal from
Welfare and Poverty                                                                       77


the model and the value of 0.009 as significance level for inclusion into the
model. We applied also a forward stepwise selection with the same significance
values, obtaining analogous results.5 The selected variables were then used to
build the full model. In subsequent steps, variables were individually tested for
collinearity,6 substitution by similar/aggregated variables, and loss of explanatory
power if removed. The final model selected was the one that provided the high-
est adjusted R squared.

Welfare results
Table 2.15 shows the results of the welfare models. The dependent variable is the
logarithm of expenditure net of UNHCR assistance as described in the previous
section on Welfare aggregates. The independent variables are organized by groups
of variables, with the first group being the variables available in PG and the other
groups following the order of the JD-HV2 questionnaire (housing, WASH
[water, sanitation and hygiene], food security, education, poverty and depen-
dency, health, documentation, and protection and specific needs). Only the
variables that were retained by the best model were also retained in the table,
which means that not all groups of variables are represented. The models section
explained the methodology we followed to reach the final model. The final
model includes 23 variables, 10 of which are from the PG data.
    The first and most important variable of the model is case size. This is partly
by construction, as the dependent variable is in per capita terms measured with
case size on the denominator. However, case size can potentially take any sign
and is used in combination with all other variables in the model, which means
that the coefficient is not predictable by construction. Removing this variable
alone would reduce the explanatory power of the model by 18.1 percent. The
variable is used in categorical dummies and all categories are significant with a
coefficient that increases linearly as the case size increases. The t-values are also
all very high (t-values of three and above indicate statistical significance). The
proportion of children in the case is significant with increasing coefficients across
the categories, but it is a less important variable than case size. After controlling
for case size, the removal of this variable leads to an R squared reduction of only
0.1 percent. Hence, case size predicts welfare much better than the share of
children in the case.
    The next set of variables relates to the socioeconomic characteristics of the
PA. The occupation measured in terms of skill level is significant only for profes-
sionals, which increases welfare as expected. This variable contributes little to the
overall model (0.1 percent), whereas the variable occupational category, which
we also tested, turned out to be non-significant. This is understandable, because
the occupation refers to the status of the PA before the crisis and not to the cur-
rent occupational status. Hence the former occupation and, to a minor extent,
the skills of the PA matter little for the current welfare of the case, indicating that
returns to skills are very low for refugees. If refugees manage to work at all, the
occupational employment is unlikely to match the skill level the refugees possess.
This is evidently a non-negligible loss in human capital and productivity.7

        The age of the PA is significant and contributes to the model by 0.2 percent.
     Older age increases welfare as compared to younger age, while there is little dif-
     ference between the age classes of 35–54 and 55 and older. If the PA is of pension
     age, this is not a sign of reduced welfare for the case. Marital status is also a sig-
     nificant factor with a 0.2 percent importance, and if the PA is married or engaged
     then the case is more likely to be better off. Interestingly, being widowed reduces
     welfare as compared to being married but less so than being single, divorced, or
     separated. Education of the PA is not such an important variable in the economy
     of the model (0.1 percent) but it is clear that higher education is associated with
     higher welfare, with values that increase rather linearly as education increases.
     This is particularly true for university degrees and higher.
        The following set of variables relates to migration patterns as initially explored
     in the poverty section. The place of origin is generally important (0.2 percent)
     and cases coming from Damascus are almost invariably better off than cases
     coming from other governorates in Syria. Cases coming from Hama and Idleb are
     those most likely to be worse off. Whether the arrival has been formal or not is
     significant with formal entry increasing the probability of being wealthier for a
     case. The place of destination in Jordan is more important than the place of ori-
     gin, with the removal of this variable reducing the explanatory power of the
     model by 1.1 percent. Those settling in Amman are almost invariably better off
     than those settling in other governorates. Cases settling in Tafilah, Zarqa, and
     Mafraq are those worse off despite the fact that we are not considering cases
     hosted in camps but only cases living outside camps. People crossing the border
     by land have lower welfare than people crossing the border by air as expected.
     Particularly deprived are those who came through the Tal Shihab and Nasib
     (official and unofficial) border crossings. This destination variable reduces the
     model prediction capacity by 0.2 percent if removed.
        The variables illustrated so far are available in the PG data and together have
     an explanatory power of 48 percent. This may not seem much but it is a fairly
     good result in econometric modeling and only 5 percentage points below the full
     model that includes all JD-HV2 variables that were retained in the final model
     as discussed in what follows.
        Among housing variables, we found having a kitchen, electricity, and ventila-
     tion to be important. These all increase welfare, and the most important of these
     is having a kitchen, which, if removed, reduces the explanatory power of the
     model by 0.39 percent. Also relevant is having the combination of piped sewer-
     age and water (these variables were not significant if taken independently). A
     house built in cement increases welfare and is fairly relevant (0.16 percent). But
     the most important variable for housing and the second most important of the
     model is whether the case pays rent or owns their accommodation (3.55 per-
     cent). This is expected of course. We should also consider that the large majority
     of cases pays rent or owns the accommodation (92.5 percent), which means that
     the group worse off is rather small. Finally, the crowding variable, measured in
     terms of square meters per capita, is important (0.31 percent). Increased space
     per person is associated with increased welfare as expected.
Welfare and Poverty                                                                      79


    The last set of variables adds little to the overall model (the R squared does
not change) but some variables are nevertheless significant. These include seek-
ing humanitarian assistance or assistance from host family or community among
the coping strategies, all with negative values, and whether the certificate of
asylum is valid, which has a positive value.
    In all models, we also control for whether the case receives UNHCR financial
assistance. This variable is consistently negative in all models and is the third most
important variable for the overall model (2.28 percent). Recall that our depen-
dent variable does not include UNHCR financial assistance for the reasons
already explained in the Welfare aggregates section. The reason for including the
indicator of whether the case receives UNHCR assistance (binary 0/1 variable)
is that this signals whether (pre-assistance) eligible cases are effectively poorer.
This is indeed the case as shown by the sign and importance of the variable and
confirms that the UNHCR cash assistance is provided to cases more in need.
    As a last test, we use as a dependent variable per capita adult equivalent
expenditure instead of per capita expenditure (table 2.19). We consider two dif-
ferent equivalence scales, the square root of the case size (column 2) and the
modified OECD scale (column 3). Table 2.19 reveals that case size remains the
covariate with the strongest effect on expenditure, also when considering adult
equivalent expenditure; however, its effect is much weaker than in the case of
per capita expenditure as dependent variable (column 1). In particular, the
impact of case size on expenditure is higher when using the modified OECD
equivalence scale than the square root scale. All the remaining regressors main-
tain very similar values of beta coefficient and t-ratio with both per capita
expenditure and per capita adult equivalent expenditure as a dependent vari-
able (the only exception is the percentage of children in case of the modified
OECD scale).

Poverty results
The difference between welfare modeling and poverty modeling is that welfare
modeling provides results for the whole distribution of cases while poverty mod-
eling focuses on the factors that matter for the cases below the poverty line.
Hence, it is important to understand that the results of poverty modeling largely
depend on the level of the poverty line. If this level is very high and all cases fall
under the poverty line, then the poverty model will be equal to the welfare
model in terms of the factors that matter (coefficients are different because in
poverty modeling we use logit or probit estimators while in welfare models we
use OLS estimators). If, vice versa, the poverty line is very low, then the cases
that fall under the poverty line are few and the model will focus on these cases
and will result in a model that looks quite different from the welfare model in
terms of predictors. Therefore, if one wants to have general rules for predicting
welfare irrespective of the poverty line, the welfare model is more appropriate.
If one, instead, is confident of the poverty line and wishes to focus only on those
cases below the poverty line, then the poverty model is more appropriate.
80                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


        In the first of the poverty models (table 2.16), we use the same poverty line
     used for the poverty profile and discussed in the section on Poverty lines (JD 50/
     capita/person). Results are very similar to the welfare model. This is not particu-
     larly surprising because, as already explained, the poverty line is fairly high and
     includes over half of the cases considered. However, some changes are visible. For
     example, cases with 12 and more people predict poverty perfectly, which
     explains why the model drops the last category of the case size. There are also
     variables that are excluded as compared to the welfare model and new variables
     that are added to the model. For example, having a kitchen or ventilation and
     searching for host family support are dropped from the poverty model, while
     having sanitary and latrine and having children not attending school as a coping
     strategy are new variables that appear in the poverty model and were not signifi-
     cant in the welfare model. The importance of variables that are retained by both
     the welfare and poverty models also changes in the poverty model, although the
     most important variables of case size and rent remain the same. Overall, the
     welfare and the JD 50 poverty model are very similar and almost identical if we
     consider PG variables only.
        The second of the poverty models (table 2.17) considers the same variables of
     the first model but a different poverty line of half the previous line (JD 25/
     capita/person). This is to see how the same variables change in importance when
     we lower the poverty line and we focus on the extreme poor. The most impor-
     tant variables remain essentially in the same order. It is noteworthy, however, that
     the UNHCR assistance dummy becomes much more important in the JD 25
     poverty model as compared to the JD 50 model. This clearly signals that the
     UNHCR assistance, which is partly based on a poverty line of 50 JD, predicts
     better who is poor below the JD 25 threshold. This is expected of course because
     the likelihood of covering those cases below JD 25 with a JD 50 poverty line is
     higher than the likelihood of capturing those below the JD 50 poverty line with
     a JD 50 poverty line. Compared to the previous model (JD 50 poverty line), the
     case size reduces its importance, while employment and age of the PA, governor-
     ate of origin, being owner or renting the house, and seeking humanitarian assis-
     tance become more important. The pseudo-R squared also decreases in the
     second poverty model, because we simply kept the variables that suited the first
     poverty model with no ad hoc selection process.
        This is what we do in the third and last of the poverty models (table 2.18).
     Results show that the final set of predictors is similar to the welfare and the first
     poverty model but that there are further changes in terms of variables dropped
     and added as compared to the first poverty model. For example, employment,
     education, sanitary, piped sewerage and water, non-food items (NFIs), and coping
     with community are all excluded from the last poverty model. Instead ventila-
     tion is recovered as in the welfare model. A new entry is the date of arrival, which
     reveals that the refugees arrived in Jordan in 2012 and in 2013 are the poorest.
     PG variables continue to be very much the same in all models (except for educa-
     tion and occupation) and there are also JD-HV2 variables that are consistent
     across the welfare and all poverty models including rent, cement house, electricity,
Welfare and Poverty                                                                      81


crowding, coping with aid, and the dummy for UNHCR assistance. Therefore,
some variables seem to be solid foundations for any welfare or poverty model
while other variables require a more attentive scrutiny and depend on the pov-
erty line set for the poverty models.

Predictions tests
We now test the capacity of the poverty models used in the previous section to
predict poverty correctly. In essence, the exercise consists in using the parameters
estimated by the models to predict the dependent variable of the model (poor/
non-poor) as if we did not have information on this variable. Table 2.14 shows
the results using different poverty lines and different probabilities thresholds.
The models estimate probabilities of poverty for each case and these probabili-
ties vary between 0 and 1. For example, a case can have a probability of being
poor of 60 percent. To test the goodness of the model, we need to determine the
probability threshold that we wish to use to decide whether the model assigns a
value of poor or non-poor to the case. This threshold is usually 50 percent. If a
case is more than 50 percent likely to be poor, then we can say that the model
predicts this case to be poor. Sometimes, we may want to change this threshold.
That is because each threshold corresponds to a specific coverage rate and leak-
age rate. Changing the threshold may improve on one of the two rates such as
the leakage rate, while making the coverage rate worse. Depending on which rate
we are most interested in, we may adapt the threshold to optimize that particu-
lar rate. This is why it is important to see how the inclusion and exclusion errors
vary as we vary the probability threshold.
   The top panel of table 2.14 shows that, using a poverty line of JD 50 and a 50
percent threshold, the model would be able to predict correctly if a case is poor
90.1 percent of the time, which implies that 9.9 percent of the time the model
would predict poor cases as non-poor (under-coverage rate or exclusion error).

     The model would also predict correctly if a case is non-poor 60.9 percent of the
     time, which means that 39.1 percent of the time the model would predict as
     poor non-poor cases (leakage rate or inclusion error). Evidently, the first type of
     error (under-coverage) is more problematic from a policy and welfare perspec-
     tive, while the second type of error (leakage) is more problematic from a budget
     perspective.
        The middle panel repeats the exercise using a poverty line of JD 25 and a 50
     percent threshold. We can see now that the exclusion error becomes much larger
     (53.8 percent) while the leakage rate is much lower (8 percent). Hence, as we
     lower the poverty rate, the prediction capacity of the model worsens from the
     perspective of under-coverage but improves from the perspective of leakage. The
     bottom panel repeats the exercise with a poverty line of JD 25 and a probability
     threshold of 30 percent. This time, the under-coverage rate improves (27.4 per-
     cent) while the leakage rate worsens. Clearly, changing the poverty line and the
     probability threshold affects targeting results. Hence, it is important to fine tune
     both parameters (poverty line and probability threshold) to obtain results the clos-
     est as possible to the error we want to minimize (under-coverage or leakage).
        As a final exercise, we test more precisely the performance of our model in
     terms of the trade-off between coverage and leakage. Figure 2.5 plots the cover-
     age rate (y-axis) against the leakage rate (x-axis) and draws the curve that derives
     from using different probability thresholds. The interpretation of the curve is the
     following. The diagonal represents an equal probability of coverage and leakage,

which is what one would obtain if we were targeting refugees randomly (blindly)
with no model. Points on the left of the diagonal show the performance of mod-
els that do better than random draws. Clearly, our model does better than ran-
dom targeting as all points of the curve are on the left of the diagonal. The points
further away from the diagonal are those that indicate the best performance and
there is clearly one point on the curve where the distance between the curve and
the diagonal is maximized. This is the point that offers the best coverage while
minimizing leakage. To this point corresponds a particular probability threshold,
which is what can be used to maximize the targeting performance of the model.


Conclusions
This chapter provided a poverty profile and welfare assessment of the Syrian
refugees in Jordan. The purpose of the poverty profile was three-fold. It provides
a first indication of the poverty pockets, it helps to provide some useful indica-
tions of the important variables to be used in the welfare model, and it helps to
highlight the dimensions that could matter from a policy perspective. In the
second part of the chapter, we studied the possible predictors of welfare and
poverty. The purpose of the work was also multi-fold. First, we are interested in
identifying the main predictors of welfare and poverty for a population of refu-
gees. Second, welfare modeling can indicate how variables that are already
included in the PG data perform in terms of predicting welfare and consequently
learn about variables that are important for predicting welfare but are not already
included in the PG data. Third, the welfare model can be used to evaluate the
targeting of the WFP food program and UNHCR cash program. Fourth, it can be
used for developing a targeting approach based on a proxy means test (PMT) or
other methods. Fifth, it can be used to simulate alternative policies toward refugees
and test the potential effects of these policies in advance of implementation.
   The chapter provided a detailed scrutiny of the data and explained in detail
the measures used. We focused on refugees outside camps living in urban areas
and used Home Visits data, which we considered the most representative data
set of refugees living in Jordan currently available. As a welfare measure, we used
an expenditure aggregate net of UNHCR financial assistance. The UNHCR pov-
erty line of JD 50/person/month was used as a threshold to separate the poor
from the non-poor.
   The poverty profile showed that Syrian refugees follow particular trajectories
depending on where they flee from and where they settle in Jordan and that
these trajectories reveal different paths of poverty. It is visible, for example, that
refugees coming from the Syrian governorates of Aleppo and Damascus and
going to the Jordan governorate of Tafilah are among the poorest with over 90
percent poverty rate. Many among these refugees had already been displaced
before the crisis due to the persistent drought in the Northeast of Syria. This
affected poor agricultural workers, who moved to the urban centers such as
Aleppo and Damascus in search of work during the years that preceded the
popular uprising.
84                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


        Another useful angle is to look at the time of entry into the country. The
     group that entered Jordan before the Syrian crisis and the latest group of entrants
     have the lowest poverty rates, whereas the peak of poverty is associated with
     those who entered in 2012 and 2013, which coincides with the peak of the crisis.
     Additional insights can be learned looking at the point of entry and the formal
     status of refugees. The majority of refugees entered the country informally (57.5
     percent) and we observe that a few refugees entered informally by air (forged
     documents). As one would expect, refugees who entered Jordan informally suffer
     from higher poverty irrespective of the point of entry, with a difference in pov-
     erty rates of almost 18 percentage points. We also observe that poverty is associ-
     ated with the point of entry. The highest poverty rates are found for refugees
     entering Jordan via the Ruwaished and Hadallat borders.
        Socioeconomic characteristics of the PA provide some clues about the poverty
     status of a case. Married PAs below the age of 18 make up about 0.3 percent of
     the population. This is a small group in percentage terms but a sizable group in
     numbers (about 650 cases). Poverty is the highest for the age group 35–49, pre-
     sumably because this is the group with the largest number of children of young
     age. For the same reason, poverty is also higher for married and engaged people
     as opposed to other marital status groups. Single people have the lowest poverty
     rate and this seems to apply also to people aged 50 and above. In general, poverty
     increases as we pass from white-collar types of occupations (pre-crisis) to blue-
     collar types and the highest poverty rate is found among skilled agricultural work-
     ers. The largest group by current highest educational level attained are those with
     6–8 years of education (almost half of the population) and this group is, somehow
     surprisingly, also the one with the highest poverty rate. We can also find cells
     with extreme poverty rates such as skilled agricultural workers with 9–11 years
     of education where the poverty rate reaches almost 81 percent. Hence, agricul-
     tural workers who were particularly affected by the drought in Syria before the
     crisis remain the poorest population group in the post-crisis refugee status.
        Case characteristics provide additional insights. Case size and the share of
     children in the case are very important for poverty, as is common among poor
     populations, but this phenomenon seems to be extreme with the Syrian refugee
     population. People living in larger cases (5 persons and more) have, by far, the
     highest poverty rates. The poverty rate jumps for each additional case member
     and for each additional child. For example, from one to two members, the pov-
     erty rate jumps from 12.5 percent to 22.4 percent and it jumps from 39.8 per-
     cent to 57 percent from one to two children. It is also noteworthy that for a few
     cases, the case size is equal to the number of children.
        The situation of children is also revealing. Children of school age are expected
     to be in school but refugee children face many challenges in enrolling in educa-
     tional institutions due to scarce supply, financial constraints, crowding, psycho-
     logical distress, and other issues that would not normally exist for children in
     regular populations. Only about half of Syrian refugee children in Jordan attend
     school despite the fact that Jordan provides free education to refugees. About 34
     percent of the population lives in cases where at least one child is not attending
Welfare and Poverty                                                                      85


school. Children out of school are at higher risk of child labor, and indeed we
find that about 3.6 percent of the population lives in cases where at least one
child is working. This is likely to be a lower-bound estimate as child labor is one
of the questionnaire items that is most likely to be under-reported because of
shame or legal issues.
   Through welfare and poverty modeling, we were able to identify the key pre-
dictors of poverty. Following a systematic process of variable selections, we
reached a final welfare model including a total of 23 variables, 10 of which are
from the PG data.
   The first and most important variable of the model is case size. The proportion
of children in the case is also significant, with increasing coefficients as the share
of children increases, but is still a far less important variable than case size.
Occupation measured in terms of skill level is significant only for professionals,
which increases welfare as expected, but the former occupation and, to a minor
extent, the skills of the PA matter little for the current welfare of the case. Hence,
returns to skills are very low for refugees. When refugees do manage to work,
these occupations do not reflect their skills level. This is a non-negligible loss in
human capital and productivity.
   The age of the PA is significant, with older age increasing welfare as compared
to younger age. If the PA is of pension age, this is not a sign of reduced welfare
for the case. Marital status is also a significant factor. If the PA is married or
engaged, the case is more likely to be better off. Interestingly, being widowed
reduces welfare as compared to being married but less so than being single,
divorced, or separated. Education of the PA is not such an important variable in
the economy of the model. However, it is clear that higher education is associ-
ated with higher welfare, with values that increase rather linearly as education
increases. This is particularly true for university degrees and higher.
   As for the poverty profile, migration patterns offer some insights into the
predictors of welfare. The place of origin is generally important (0.2 percent) and
cases coming from Damascus are almost invariably better off than cases coming
from other governorates in Syria. Cases coming from Hama and Idleb are those
most likely to be deprived. Whether the arrival has been formal or not is very
significant with formal entry increasing significantly the probability of being
wealthier for a case. The place of destination in Jordan is more important than
the place of origin. Those settling in Amman are almost invariably better off than
those settling in other governorates. Those settling in Tafilah, Zarqa, and Mafraq
are those most deprived despite the fact that we are not considering cases in
camps. People crossing the border by land are worse off than people crossing the
border by air as expected. Particularly in distress are those who came through the
Tal Shihab and Nasib (official and unofficial) border crossings.
   The variables illustrated so far are available in the PG data and together have
an explanatory power of 48 percent, only 5 percent lower than the best model
we could reach using all variables. This is an important indication that the PG
data alone can be used for estimating welfare in the absence of welfare measures
such as income or expenditure.
86                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


         Home Visit variables include variables related to housing, non-financial assis-
     tance, WASH, food security, education, dependency, health, protection, and
     special needs. Among housing variables, we found having a kitchen, electricity,
     and ventilation to be important. These all increase welfare, and the most impor-
     tant of these is having a kitchen. Also relevant is having the combination of piped
     sewerage and water. A house built in cement increases welfare and is fairly rele-
     vant; but the most important variable for housing, and the second most impor-
     tant of the model, is whether the case pays rent or owns its accommodation. This
     is expected of course and we should consider that the large majority of cases pay
     rent or own the accommodation (92.5 percent). The crowding variable measured
     in terms of square meters per capita is also important and associated with
     increased welfare. Seeking humanitarian assistance or assistance from host fami-
     lies or communities signal lower welfare, whereas having a valid certificate of
     asylum increases welfare.
         In all models, we also controlled for whether the case receives UNHCR finan-
     cial assistance. This variable is consistently negative in all models and is the third
     most important variable for the overall model. Our dependent variable does not
     include UNHCR financial assistance for reasons explained in the section on wel-
     fare measures. The reason for including the indicator of whether the case receives
     UNHCR assistance is that this signals whether (pre-assistance) eligible cases are
     effectively poorer. This is indeed the case as shown by the sign and importance
     of the variable and confirms that the UNHCR cash assistance is provided to cases
     more in need.
         In the last section of the paper, we turned to model poverty. The difference
     between welfare modeling and poverty modeling is that welfare modeling pro-
     vides results for the whole distribution of cases while poverty modeling focuses
     on the factors that matter the most for the poor. Therefore, the results of poverty
     modeling largely depend on the level of the poverty line selected. If this level is
     very high and all cases fall under the poverty line, then the poverty model will
     be almost identical to the welfare model in terms of the factors that matter. If,
     vice versa, the poverty line is very low, then the cases that fall under the poverty
     line are few and the model will focus on these cases, resulting in a model that
     looks quite different from the welfare model in terms of predictors. Therefore, if
     one wants to have general rules for predicting welfare irrespective of the poverty
     line, the welfare model is more appropriate. If one, instead, is confident of the
     poverty line and wishes to focus only on those cases below the poverty line, then
     the poverty model is more appropriate.
         With a poverty model that uses a poverty line of JD 50/capita/person, results
     are very similar to the welfare model. This is not particularly surprising because
     the poverty line is fairly high and includes over half of the cases considered and
     almost 70 percent of the population. However, some changes are visible. For
     example, cases with 12 or more people predict poverty perfectly. There are also
     variables that are excluded as compared to the welfare model and new variables
     entered the model. For example, having a kitchen or ventilation and searching for
Welfare and Poverty                                                                    87


host family support are dropped from the poverty model, while having sanitary
and latrine facilities and having children not attending school as a coping strategy
are new variables that appear in the poverty model and are not significant in the
welfare model. The importance of variables that are retained by both the welfare
and the poverty models also changes in the poverty model, although the most
important variables of case size and rent remain the same. Overall, the welfare
and the JD 50 poverty model are very similar and almost identical if we consider
PG variables only.
   Comparing the welfare model to poverty models with different poverty lines
shows that some variables seem to be solid foundations for any welfare or pov-
erty model, while other variables require a more attentive scrutiny and depend
on the poverty line set for the poverty models. PG variables are very much the
same in all models (except for education and occupation). In addition, there are
JD-HV2 variables that are consistent across the welfare and all poverty models,
including rent, cement house, electricity provision, crowding, coping with aid,
and the dummy for UNHCR assistance.
   Finally, we tested the capacity of the poverty models to predict poverty cor-
rectly. Considering a JD 50 poverty line and a 50 percent probability threshold,
the model would be able to predict correctly if a case is poor 90.1 percent of the
time, which implies that 9.9 percent of the time the model would predict poor
cases as non-poor (under-coverage or exclusion error). The model also predicts
correctly if a case is non-poor 60.9 percent of the time, which means that 39.1
percent of the time the model predicts non-poor cases as poor (leakage rate or
inclusion error). Evidently, the first type of error (under-coverage) is more prob-
lematic from a policy and welfare perspective, whereas the second type of error
(leakage) is more problematic from a budget perspective. We also found that
there is a clear trade-off between increasing coverage of the poor and decreasing
leakage to the non-poor. However, one can fine tune the cut-off point chosen for
the probability threshold to optimize the best trade-off between these two out-
comes using the curve proposed in the last section of this chapter.

Notes
 1. As explained in the executive summary, this chapter and chapters 3 and 4 will focus
    on Jordan only. The extension to Lebanon and other data sets is carried out in chapter
    5 and appendixes A, B, and C..

 3. It is important to note here that it is not possible to draw a sample of refugees which is
    perfectly representative of the refugee population. That is because the exact refugee
    population is not known and one does not have a master sample for sampling purposes.
 4. In applied econometric work, this systematic procedure is usually unnecessary given
    that the important variables are largely known. But in the context of a refugee popula-
    tion this was deemed necessary because of the lack of literature on welfare modeling
    on refugee data and the exploratory nature of this work.
 5. The forward stepwise method, at each step, enters the variable with the largest F-to-
    enter statistic, provided that this is greater than the threshold value for F-to-enter.
    When there are no variables left to enter for which F-to-enter statistics are above the
    threshold, the model checks to see whether the F-to-remove statistics of any variables
    added previously have fallen below the F-to-remove threshold. If so, it removes the
    less performing variable, and then continues with trials. It finally stops when no vari-
    ables either in or out of the model have F-statistics on the wrong side of their respec-
    tive thresholds.
 6. We checked for the collinearity of the variables selected using the variance inflation
    factor (VIF).
 7. The results of occupational employment have to be used with great care. Chapter 1
    showed that large and unexplained discrepancies exist between the refugees’ former
    occupational employment and the Syrian pre-crisis population.

Introduction
Welfare and poverty analyses based on household data provide a snapshot of the
level of deprivation of a certain population in a particular point in time.
Longitudinal or panel data are generally required to better understand the evolu-
tion of welfare and poverty over time, but these data are harder to come by or
may be difficult to compare over long spans of time.
   An alternative and complementary approach to the study of poverty is the
study of vulnerability to poverty. The term vulnerability is largely used by
humanitarian and developmental organizations alike and the meaning attributed
to this term can be very diverse. In strictly economic terms, the notion of vulner-
ability is associated with the concept of risk and the concept of risk, in turn,
implies some time dimension. But the economic profession has also widely used
the term vulnerability to identify, for example, people who are not poor but have
an income that is close to the poverty line in a particular point in time. The term
vulnerability in economics has also been applied beyond monetary dimensions.
For example, economists talk of vulnerability to shocks, which can be economic
but also climatic or environmental.
   Humanitarian organizations also use the term vulnerability. There is no strict
definition but the term is applied to various dimensions of deprivation. For
example, a selected number of statuses of refugees such as being a widow or hav-
ing many children can qualify refugees as “vulnerable” and entitle them to special
assistance or services. The World Food Programme (WFP) may talk of food
deprived or vulnerable people and humanitarian organizations working on health
may use the term vulnerability to identify people at risk of certain diseases or
violence. The chapter on concepts and definitions has provided several examples
of how humanitarian organizations use the term vulnerability.
   In this chapter, we follow a recent strand of the economic literature
(Chaudhuri et al. 2002) that defines vulnerability to poverty as the risk of being
poor in the near future, where the near future is usually intended in terms of one
year. This literature is particularly useful for our purpose because it does not

98                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


     require longitudinal or panel data, which we do not have for the refugee popula-
     tion under consideration. It uses instead a statistical procedure to estimate the
     risk of poverty in the near future using only cross-section data.
        Moreover, the methodology can be applied to monetary and nonmonetary
     dimensions, which allows us also to see how monetary and nonmonetary dimen-
     sions relate in terms of vulnerability. For the monetary dimension, we will use
     expenditure per capita as the measure to estimate poverty. For the nonmonetary
     dimensions, we take two representative measures currently used by humanitar-
     ian organizations assisting refugees: the WFP Food Consumption Score (FCS)
     and the UNHCR Crowding Index (CI). For both monetary and nonmonetary
     indicators we will estimate the degree of vulnerability and the predictors of vul-
     nerability. We will also assess the relation between monetary and nonmonetary
     vulnerability to gauge the policy implications of treating nonmonetary depriva-
     tions with cash assistance programs.
        Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to measure monetary vulnerability
     for refugees in Jordan, see how monetary vulnerability overlaps with poverty, and
     how monetary vulnerability is related to nonmonetary vulnerability. If vulnera-
     bility largely overlaps with poverty, then measures designed to address poverty
     would be sufficient to address vulnerability issues. Similarly, if monetary vulner-
     ability is closely associated with nonmonetary vulnerability, policies that address
     monetary vulnerability would be sufficient to address nonmonetary
     vulnerability.
        Some interesting results emerge from the analysis. The chapter clearly shows
     that poverty and vulnerability to poverty are two related but quite different
     concepts. Good predictors of poverty may not be good predictors of vulnerability
     and vice versa. Poverty may be larger than vulnerability and the contrary can also
     be true depending on various factors, including the poverty line used. We also
     find nonmonetary indicators such as the FCS and the CI to behave very differ-
     ently from each other and in relation to monetary vulnerability, with the former
     weakly associated and the latter strongly associated with monetary
     vulnerability.
        The chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the con-
     cepts of vulnerability as recently proposed by the economic literature. The third
     section explains the vulnerability model used and its application, the fourth sec-
     tion discusses results, and the final section concludes.


     Concepts
     Poverty is an ex post measure of household welfare. However, the current pov-
     erty status may not necessarily be a good indicator of being poor tomorrow. Non-
     poor households at the present time may have a high probability of becoming
     poor tomorrow, while some poor households today may be only transiting pov-
     erty because of an unexpected temporary shock. As mentioned by Ceriani
     (2015), if the aim of studying poverty is not only alleviating the economic condi-
     tion of those who are poor today, but also preventing people from becoming
     poor in the future, a forward-looking perspective should be adopted.
Vulnerability                                                                            99


   The economic literature has recently introduced the concept of vulnerability
to poverty, referring to the uncertainty of being poor in the future. The World
Development Report 2000/2001, for instance, underlines that: “poverty is more
than inadequate income or human development, it is also vulnerability and a lack
of voice, power, and representation [...] Reducing vulnerability—to economic
shocks, natural disasters, ill health, disability, and personal violence—is an intrin-
sic part of enhancing well-being” (World Bank 2001: 12).
   The concept of economic vulnerability is more complicated to grasp than
poverty, as it introduces the complex notion of uncertainty: future distributions
of outcomes are indeed unknown and the vulnerability of households is unob-
servable to the policy maker. Due to this complexity, there is still no consensus
about the definition of economic vulnerability to poverty. There are three main
concepts of economic vulnerability conceived in the literature: (i) vulnerability
as exposure to risk (VER), (ii) vulnerability as expected poverty (VEP), and (iii)
vulnerability as low expected utility (VEU). These three concepts are briefly
described below:1

1. Vulnerability as exposure to risk (VER): Vulnerability is defined as lack of
   insurance against shocks. Individuals in low-income countries do not have
   access to effective insurance mechanisms, and are therefore exposed to income
   fluctuations due to erratic weather, price variability, crop failures, or human
   illnesses. If insurance mechanisms were effective, individuals could smooth
   consumption over time, by pooling risks or by borrowing against adverse
   shocks, independently of income fluctuations. In this framework, an individual
   is defined as vulnerable if current consumption falls below the poverty line
   although permanent income stays above it.
2. Vulnerability as expected poverty (VEP): Vulnerability is defined as the ex
   ante risk that an individual will be poor in the future. In contrast with poverty,
   which is an ex post measure of household welfare, vulnerability is a forward-
   looking measure of household welfare. As suggested by Chaudhuri et al.
   (2002), whereas the status of poor is observable, the status of being vulnerable
   can only be estimated or inferred. Within this framework, some authors define
   vulnerability as the risk that a household, if currently non-poor, will fall below
   the poverty line in the future (Dang and Lanjouw 2014; Kuhl 2003; Pritchett
   et al. 2000; Suryahadi and Sumarto 2003). Others also include among the
   vulnerable households that are currently poor and have a high probability of
   remaining poor in the future (Calvo and Dercon 2013; Chaudhuri et al. 2002;
   Christiaensen and Boisvert 2000; Christiaensen and Subbarao 2005).
3. Vulnerability as low expected utility (VEU): Vulnerability is the difference
   between a household utility derived from certainty-equivalent consumption
   and its expected utility derived from actual consumption. The certainty-equiv-
   alent consumption is defined in such a way that if the household had certain
   consumption greater than or equal to this number, the household would not
   be regarded as vulnerable. Thus, the certainty-equivalent consumption is simi-
   lar to the concept of poverty line in the poverty measurement. See, for exam-
   ple, Ligon and Schechter (2003).
100                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


         In this paper, we will use the VEP definition: vulnerability is the ex ante risk
      that an individual or a household will be poor in the future. This is the definition
      that corresponds to the only model we can use given the available cross-section
      data. Moreover, we include among the vulnerable both households that are cur-
      rently non-poor and have a high probability of falling below the poverty line in
      the future, and households that are currently poor and have a high probability of
      remaining poor in the future.
         The chapter will also apply the VEP concept and tools to study nonmonetary
      poverty. Humanitarian organizations use the term vulnerability extensively,
      attributing to this term various meanings and applying it to various dimensions
      of deprivation. In this chapter, we pick two nonmonetary measures of depriva-
      tion in use among humanitarian organizations and use them to estimate vulner-
      ability with the same VEP method we use to estimate monetary vulnerability.
      These measures are the WFP’s FCS and the UNHCR’s CI. The FCS and CI
      measures are two of the most popular indicators among humanitarian organiza-
      tions and they cover basic needs such as food and housing. They are used in this
      chapter as two representative examples of nonmonetary measures used by
      humanitarian organizations.


      Models
      As mentioned above, we focus on the VEP model. The natural steps to apply the
      VEP model are the following: (i) choose a vulnerability indicator; (ii) forecast
      future outcomes and variability of the vulnerability indicator in order to estimate
      the ex ante probability distribution of ex post welfare; and (iii) determine a vul-
      nerability threshold to assign observations to the vulnerable and non-vulnerable
      status. These choices are mainly driven by data availability and by the type of
      society targeted in the study—for instance, whether there are panel data or cross-
      country data, or whether the society is rural, developed, or undeveloped.
         As a vulnerability indicator we consider household expenditure per capita.
      The main reasons for selecting this indicator is that expenditure has the advan-
      tage of incorporating information about a household’s ability to smooth income
      shocks. Income in poor countries is generally a less reliable indicator than expen-
      diture because it is often under-reported and because it is subject to sharp varia-
      tions during the year, especially in rural areas. This is particularly the case for a
      refugee population which, by circumstances, has no income or low income gen-
      erated occasionally and primarily in the informal sector. Indeed, in the data set
      used for this study, the Home Visits database for Jordan, second round (JD-
      HV2), the expenditure measure has been proven to be higher and much more
      reliable than the income measure (see chapter 2, section on welfare
      aggregates).
         Within the VEP framework, there are different models designed to estimate
      and predict future expenditure and its variability in order to estimate the ex ante
      probability of future expenditure, and these models depend on the type of data
      available. The probability that a household will be poor in the future depends not

only on its expected future expenditure, but also on the volatility of its expendi-
ture pattern. We quote an interesting example in Chauduri et al. (2002): “A sala-
ried low-level government employee with an expected level of consumption
roughly similar to that of a self-employed proprietor of a small business may
nevertheless be much less vulnerable to poverty because of the relative stability
of the former’s consumption stream.” Therefore, estimating vulnerability to pov-
erty requires estimating both the expected expenditure (forward looking) and its
intertemporal variance.
   Ideally, rich and long panel data or repeated cross-section data would be pref-
erable for vulnerability estimation, since with such data one could directly esti-
mate the intertemporal variance of expenditure. However, such data are rare,
particularly in developing countries, and alternative methodologies have been
developed to produce estimates with single cross-section data. In this paper we
follow the methodology proposed by Chauduri et al. (2002), which requires the
following assumptions: (i) most of the variability in the observed expenditure is
due to variability in observed covariates; (ii) the distribution of expenditure is
log-normal; and (iii) the distribution of expenditure is heteroscedastic. The vari-
ance of each household’s expenditure depends on the respective household
characteristics. Or, in other words, the idiosyncratic shocks may vary across
households. The model is based on the following equations:

(3.1)

(3.2)

where the expenditure of the h-th case ch is assumed to have a log-normal distri-
bution; Xh represents a bundle of observable case characteristics, such as case size,
dependency ratio, location (such as region), demographic characteristic of the
principal applicant (gender, education, occupation, sector of activity), possession
of land or livestock (and also the land size, or/and the value of livestock), and
community characteristics (like access to clean water, credit institutions, indus-
tries, transport facilities). β is the vector of parameters, while εh is the zero-mean
disturbance representing the unexplained case expenditure (idiosyncratic shocks
that contribute to different per capita consumption levels, as explained in
Chaudhuri et al. 2002). In equation 3.2,            refers to the variance of the unex-
plained expenditure εh, while Xh corresponds to the same set of covariates as in
equation 3.1 and θ is the vector of the corresponding parameters.
   Implicit in equation 3.1 is the assumption that the idiosyncratic shocks to
expenditure are independent and identically distributed over time within each
case. As a consequence, we cannot observe persistence in expenditure level over
time for each case. The model also assumes that the economy (captured by β) is
relatively stable over time (since β are fixed over time), ruling out the possibility
of capturing aggregate shocks. As a consequence, the uncertainty about future
expenditure cannot arise from uncertainty about the future structure of the
economy, but it stems only from the uncertainty about idiosyncratic shocks (εh).

      Equation 3.2 shows that we do not assume that the idiosyncratic shocks are
      identically distributed across cases, but we allow them to depend upon observ-
      able case characteristics (heteroscedasticity).
         This model therefore assumes that the intertemporal variance of the case
      expenditure can be measured using its cross-sectional variance. This is a strong
      assumption of course and one that cannot be tested for the population at hand.
      Testing the assumption would require having intertemporal data and comparing
      results between the intertemporal model and the cross-sectional model. Given
      that we do not have intertemporal data on refugees, this assumption cannot be
      tested. It is also important for the model to have significant variability in covari-
      ates. We would expect our sample of refugees to have a reduced variance in
      covariates as compared to the Indonesia sample used by Chaudhuri. However, it
      would be incorrect to assume that refugees are a very homogeneous sample and
      that we don’t have sufficient variance in covariates to use a model of this kind.
      The analyses in chapters 2 and 4 show that we have significant variance on most
      covariates and also in the dependent variable.
         The previous assumptions are due to the fact that we are estimating vulner-
      ability from a single cross-section data set. Equations 3.1 and 3.2 are estimated
      using a three-step feasible generalized least square (FGLS) method (originally
      proposed by Amemiya 1977). First, we estimate equation 3.1 using an ordinarily
      least squares (OLS) procedure. Second, we estimate equation 3.2 by using the log
      of the square of the residuals estimated from equation 3.1 (denoted with            )
      and regressing them on the same covariates using OLS estimation, in order to
      estimate the effects of case characteristics on the expenditure variance:

      (3.3)

      The predictions from equation 3.3,             , are then used to transform the same
      equation as follows (equation 3.4):

      (3.4)

         This transformed equation 3.4 is estimated using OLS to obtain an asymptoti-
      cally efficient FGLS estimate       . And                is a consistent estimate
      of the variance of the idiosyncratic component of case consumption,          . The
      inefficiencies of the first OLS estimates obtained from equation 3.1 are then
      corrected by weighting them with the square root of predicted values obtained
      from equation 3.4, to give equation 3.5:

      (3.5)                                                   .

         As a third step, the OLS estimates of equation 3.5 provide a consistent and
      asymptotically efficient estimate of           . Summing up, we have obtained
                  and           and we can therefore estimate the expected log-expen-
      diture of the each case h, as follows (equation 3.6):
Vulnerability                                                                                103



(3.6)

and the variance of its log-expenditure (equation 3.7):

(3.7)

   By assuming that expenditure is log-normally distributed, we can now estimate
each case’s vulnerability level, that is, the probability that, given a set of covariates,
the future case expenditure will fall below the poverty line z (equation 3.8):


(3.8)


    The last step of the methodology consists in choosing the vulnerability thresh-
old, which is defined as follows: cases whose probability of falling below the
poverty line in the future is above the vulnerability threshold are defined as
vulnerable. In this study, we consider the most common choice for the vulnera-
bility threshold, corresponding to p = 0.5. The intuition is the following: we say
that a case is vulnerable if its estimated probability of falling into poverty in the
future is higher than its estimated probability of not falling into poverty.
    It is important to stress the difference between the vulnerability model that we
have just described and a welfare model. In welfare and poverty assessments, the
disturbance term eh in equation 3.1 is usually interpreted as measurement error or
some unobservable factor that is not of interest, and it is assumed that its variance
is the same for all cases. On the contrary, in the vulnerability model that we con-
sider here the variance of the disturbance term has a relevant economic interpre-
tation, being the intertemporal variance of the log-expenditure. In fact, assuming
a different variance for all cases allows us the possibility to observe that a case
with a lower mean expenditure may face greater volatility than a case with a
higher average level of expenditure. In this study, we will apply the methodology
described above to measure both monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability.
    The paper uses two data sets generated by the UNHCR: the Profile Global
Registration System (ProGres, hereafter referred to as PG) and data from Home
Visits in Jordan, round II (JD-HV2). These data sets are used and described in
detail in chapter 2, section on data. The vulnerability model discussed in the
results section is based on the welfare model described in chapter 2. Therefore,
for the choice and description of the covariates to include in the three-step FGLS
method and for all other details concerning data and welfare aggregates, we refer
to chapter 2, section on poverty predictors.


Results
We divide the discussion of the results into monetary and nonmonetary vulner-
ability. In the second part on nonmonetary vulnerability, we also discuss the rela-
tion between monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability with the objective of
104                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      better understanding whether financial assistance can be an appropriate mean to
      address nonmonetary vulnerabilities. Recall that the concept of vulnerability
      refers to the near future. Therefore, from a policy perspective, we are trying to
      assess the types of policies that organizations working with refugees may adopt
      to prevent cases from staying poor or falling into poverty in the near future.

      Monetary vulnerability
      Table 3.1 shows the estimated coefficients of the vulnerability model for three
      different sets of covariates: (i) covariates available in PG data (model 1); (ii)
      covariates in model 1 plus information on dwelling (house) and water, sanitation,
      and hygiene (WASH) (model 2); and (iii) covariates in model 2 plus all other
      significant variables of HV or PG data (model 3). For each model, we report the
      estimates of each of the three regression models of the three-step FGLS method:
      the dependent variable in the first column is the ex ante mean, referring to expen-
      diture today (and this coincides with the welfare model discussed in chapter 2),
      the dependent variable in the second column is the ex ante variance, corresponding
      to the log of the square of the estimated residuals (which is an estimate of the
      expenditure variation), while the dependent variable in the third column is the
      corrected ex ante mean, referring to interpreted as the expenditure tomorrow.
          The model on expenditure today (columns 1, 4, and 7) has been amply dis-
      cussed in chapter 2 on welfare and poverty and we will not repeat the discussion
      here. The second column of each model illustrates the role of the variance of the
      residuals in adding or detracting information used to predict vulnerability in the
      future (the third column of each model). Looking at the variance model (col-
      umns 2, 5, and 8), we notice that the variables having a significant effect on the
      expenditure variation are: case size, employment of the principal applicant (PA)
      (if low-skilled or skilled), age of the PA (if older than 55 years), house size, rent,
      and the coping strategies. On the other hand, number of children, marital status,
      education, border crossing point, formal arrival, and governorate of destination
      do not affect the consumption variability. Also, most of the house conditions are
      not significant for explaining the variance (with the only exception of rent and
      square meters per capita greater than 15).
          Note that the signs in columns 2, 5, and 8 can be negative or positive. If a
      covariate has a significantly negative sign in the variance equation, it means that
      this covariate has a risk-decreasing effect. Data show that case size, employment,
      and education can be considered as a buffer against expenditure fluctuations. On
      the other hand, a positive sign in the variance model means that the correspond-
      ing covariate increases the cases’ economic insecurity and hence the vulnerability.
      These signs and significance levels then determine the difference between pov-
      erty today and the vulnerability to poverty tomorrow (the difference between
      the first and the third columns in each of the three models).
          For example, focusing on case size, we notice that larger cases are character-
      ized by a lower average of today expenditure (column 1), but at the same time
      by a lower variance of future expenditure (column 2). This may be due to the
      fact that more family members may contribute to greater flexibility in labor

      activities (including children). As a consequence, the estimates of the third col-
      umn (future expenditure) are slightly smaller than the ones in the first column: the
      risk-decreasing effect of case size mitigates its negative effects on future expenditure
      (and hence on vulnerability). Similarly for education, higher levels of education
      enhance today’s expenditure but lower the variance of future expenditure, revealing
      a strong effect in mitigating vulnerability. On the contrary, cases whose PA is wid-
      owed experience both lower expenditure today on average and higher variance,
      being less secure of their expenditure level tomorrow (and being more vulnerable).
          Table 3.2 (left panel) reports frequencies and shares of poverty and vulnerabil-
      ity using a poverty line of JD 50/capita/month, which is the poverty line that the
      UNHCR adopted when the data we use were collected. As a sensitivity test, we
      also use a poverty line of half the amount (right panel) and compare results.
      Using a poverty line of JD 50, the table shows that, while 69.2 percent of the
      population is poor, around 55 percent is estimated as economically vulnerable,
      according to all three models. Note that some of the people who are poor today
      may not be poor tomorrow and, vice versa, some of the people who are expected
      to be poor tomorrow may not be poor today. Hence, the share of vulnerable
      people may be higher or lower than the share of poor people depending on the
      relative importance of how many are expected to enter poverty and how many
      are expected to exit poverty. This, in turn, also depends on the poverty line. In
      table 3.2 (left panel), the share of vulnerable people in the three models is con-
      sistently lower than the share of poor people and this is partly due to the fact
      that the poverty line used is quite high. The difference in vulnerability across
      models is very small and this can also be due to the different number of observa-
      tions used by each model.2

    Using a poverty line of JD 25/capita/month (table 3.2, right panel) reduces
the poverty level by more than half. It also reduces the vulnerability level accord-
ing to all three models by about 10 percentage points. These changes result in
vulnerability shares that are much higher than the poverty share, the opposite of
what we found using a high poverty line. Hence, the lower the poverty line the
lower the vulnerability, but the change, as compared to poverty, is more modest
so that the poverty line can determine whether poverty or vulnerability is higher.
Therefore, poverty and vulnerability are two clearly distinct phenomena and
their relationship can be affected by the level of the poverty line.
    We can also assess mobility between poverty and vulnerability by cross-tabu-
lating these different dimensions. We find that mobility is quite strong. Table 3.3
cross-tabulates poverty and vulnerability to see the groups that are mobile mov-
ing from poverty to non-poverty and vice versa, and of the groups that are not
mobile, those who stay poor or non-poor. The top panel in the table puts the
total number of poor or non-poor today equal to 100. The bottom panel puts the
four groups of people from the matrix equal to 100. In both panels, we test the
sensitivity of results using the three adopted models and two poverty lines (PL),
JD 50 and JD 25/capita/month.
    If we look at model 2 and the top panel (PL = JD 50), the table reveals that
more than 61 percent of the non-poor today are vulnerable, while more than 51
percent of those who are poor today are vulnerable. In other words, only about
half of those who are poor today are expected to be poor the following year
while less than 40 percent of the non-poor today are expected to remain non-
poor. These results change relatively little across models while, as expected, they

                          change significantly if we use a much lower poverty line (PL = JD 25). In this
                          case, we find (in model 2) that 39.3 percent of the non-poor are expected to
                          become poor tomorrow while 63.5 percent of the poor today are expected to
                          stay poor tomorrow. As compared with the higher poverty line, the share of vul-
                          nerable non-poor is much lower but the share of vulnerable poor is higher.
                          Hence, the set level for the poverty line is also critical to understand mobility.
                             Referring again to model 2, if we look at mobility in terms of shares of the
                          total population (the four groups defined by poverty and mobility are put equal
                          to 100), we gain additional insights. An estimated 47.8 percent of the population
                          persists in the same status: 12.2 percent is poor neither today nor tomorrow and
                          35.6 percent is poor both today and tomorrow. The remaining 52.2 percent of
                          the population is mobile: 19.3 percent will enter poverty tomorrow, while 33.0
                          percent will exit poverty tomorrow. Again, there are no remarkable differences
                          across models but there is a big difference if we adopt a much lower poverty line
                          (PL = JD 25).
                             We now move to analyze how vulnerable cases are distributed across groups
                          defined by different characteristics to provide a general profile of the vulnerable.
                          Table 3.4 focuses on groups defined by socio-demographic characteristics of the
                          PA (education, occupation, gender, age, marital status), while table 3.5 focuses on
                          the characteristics of the case (size, number of children, housing, migration pat-
                          terns, and UNHCR assistance). We have first performed a chi-square test for the
                          independence between being vulnerable and each of the covariates listed in table
                          3.4 and table 3.5. The chi-square test affirms that being vulnerable depends signifi-
                          cantly on each of these features with the only exception of the gender of the PA.
                             Table 3.4 compares vulnerable and poor individuals. It reveals that the inci-
                          dence of vulnerability decreases as the educational level attained by the PA
                          increases. This is expected and also similar to how poverty behaves. Having a
                          professional occupation also decreases vulnerability. The incidence of vulnerable
                          cases is equally distributed between cases whose PA is female and those with a

male PA, while the poverty incidence is higher if the PA is male. Looking at the
PA’s age, the most vulnerable cases are the ones whose PA’s age is between 35
and 54 years. This is similar to poverty but the gap with other age groups is much
higher for poverty than for vulnerability. Cases whose PA is married/engaged,
single, or widowed are much more vulnerable than with a divorced PA, while
looking at poverty the singles are the group with smaller poverty incidence.
Hence, we should not expect to find the same variables to behave in the same
fashion for poverty and vulnerability. As already explained, these two groups of
people overlap but they are not identical and poverty and vulnerability are rather
different concepts.
   Table 3.5 compares the incidence of vulnerability and poverty for different
groups according to the characteristics of the case. As the case size increases or
as the number of children increases, the incidence of vulnerability increases,
though the gap in the proportion of vulnerable cases between minimum and
maximum case size is smaller (from 46 percent to 57 percent) than the gap in
the proportion of poor (from 10 percent to 94 percent). Hence, the number of
people in the case is an exceptional predictor of poverty but not a good predictor
of vulnerability. Focusing on the tenure status, the least vulnerable are cases that
are owners of their house, while the most vulnerable are the ones that have free
accommodation; differently, the least poor cases are the ones that pay rent.
Again, predictors of poverty and vulnerability may behave quite differently.

          Interestingly, while the cases that receive UNHCR assistance are poorer than
      the cases that do not have this assistance (recall that our expenditure variable is
      net of UNHCR assistance), no differences appear in terms of vulnerability.
      Indeed, the proportion of vulnerable cases in the group of cases without UNHCR
      assistance is the same as among the cases receiving cash assistance. This reveals
      that the cash assistance is effective in reducing the risk of poverty but not the risk
      of vulnerability.
          Another interesting result emerges when looking at the reassessment. Cases
      that have been subject to a reassessment are poorer than cases that received the
      first assessment, while the opposite is true for vulnerability. In the former cases,
      the incidence of vulnerability is smaller than in the latter cases. This suggests that
      cases reassessed are appropriately selected based on the present condition of
      poverty, but this choice may not help in identifying those who are vulnerable to
      poverty in the near future. Looking at the border crossing point, similar trends
      are shown in terms of poverty and vulnerability incidence: poverty and vulnera-
      bility are more concentrated in cases in which the PA crossed the border at
      Ruwaished-Hadallat or at Tal Shihab.
          The last part of table 3.5 analyzes how vulnerability and poverty incidence
      have changed over time of arrival in Jordan. Figures clearly show that the inci-
      dence of vulnerability is higher for the cases that arrived more recently. In par-
      ticular, the proportion of vulnerable population increases the shorter the time
      refugees have been in the country. The opposite is true for poverty. The cases that
      arrived just after the beginning of the crisis are poorer than the cases that arrived
      more recently. Once again, we observe that poverty and vulnerability capture
      two distinct phenomena. In particular, the phenomenon of high mobility with
      respect to vulnerability poses non-negligible problems from the perspective of
      poverty alleviation as the situation of refugees is clearly unstable.
          Figure 3.1 reports the vulnerability rates by expenditure quintile. As expected,
      the highest vulnerability is found toward the center of the distribution where we
      find that about 91 percent of the cases in the third quintile are vulnerable. These

are evidently the people who are closer to the poverty line and who are more
likely to cross the poverty line in the near future. Vulnerability declines as we
move toward the tails of the distribution but it is still rather high for the second
and fourth quintiles. Hence, the only quintiles with low vulnerability are the
poorest quintile, which is made up of poor people by definition, and the richest
quintile, where we still find that 22 percent of the cases are expected to be vul-
nerable. In essence, vulnerability is pervasive among refugees.

Nonmonetary vulnerability
In this section, we apply the same VEP approach we used for the work on mon-
etary vulnerability to nonmonetary dimensions. As already mentioned, humani-
tarian organizations use a large number of composite indicators designed to
measure various dimensions of vulnerability and some of these dimensions may
or may not include monetary components. In what follows, we focus on two
representative and popular indicators, which focus exclusively on nonmonetary
dimensions. One is the WPF’s FCS and the second one is the UNHCR’s CI.
   In the same fashion as we did for poverty, we can apply the VEP model to
these two indexes and measure nonmonetary vulnerability. We then compare
monetary and nonmonetary vulnerability to better understand the relation
between the two concepts for policy purposes. If monetary and nonmonetary
poverty and vulnerability are closely related, then monetary programs such as the
UNHCR cash program are likely to address monetary and nonmonetary types of
deprivation. If, vice versa, monetary and nonmonetary poverty and vulnerability
are explained by very different factors, then cash programs will be inadequate to
address nonmonetary issues and agencies would need to focus on devising non-
monetary forms of assistance such as assistance in kind or services.

Food vulnerability model
The first indicator of noneconomic vulnerability that we consider is the FCS. We
apply the same methodology used for monetary vulnerability, based on the three-
step FGLS model. As for the welfare model, we followed a systematic approach
to identify the variables that most matter for the FCS model. The estimates are
illustrated in table 3.6. As before, column 1 refers to the OLS regression of the
food consumption score on a set of significant covariates. Column 2 reports the
estimates for the food consumption score variation across cases (that is, the log
of the square of the estimated residuals) and the last model in column 3 is a cor-
rected estimation of the future food consumption score. In order to explore the
relation between the nonmonetary FCS index and expenditure, we also repeat
the three equations adding the log of expenditure per capita (columns 4–6).
    The first notable result is that the explanatory power of the model is rather
weak, having an R squared of only 10 percent. The range of variables that have
been retained by the best model we could find is also narrow. Origin and destina-
tion of refugees were found to be important but only for selected governorates,
like Dar’a for the place of origin and Irbid for the place of destination. Overall,

the destination place seems more important to explain the food score. This
makes sense given that the WFP food vouchers are distributed in Jordan at a fixed
amount and the program may have different degrees of impact in the different
governorates due to prices, program administration, and other local factors.
   The final selection of variables also included two variables that understand-
ably relate to food. The first is having proper storage facilities, which improves
the food consumptions score significantly. One lesson from this finding may be
that the provision of such storage facilities like a fridge may prove effective in
improving food consumption, even more so than providing food itself. Clearly
food storage facilities allow households to shop when and where prices are better
and stock up on food and this allows to smooth consumption over time.
Borrowing money is the other variable that predicts the food consumption score
well. This may mean that cases that are unable to feed themselves properly are
the first in resorting to borrowing money. Such a finding may suggest that cases
seek monetary aid when in need for food rather than searching for food aid,
which is a variable that we considered but that did not emerge as significant.
   The other significant variables that we found were knowledge about health
facilities and the possession of basic toiletries such as toothpaste and shampoo.
The first variable may be a proxy of knowledge about services in general, while
the last two variables would suggest that extremely food deprived cases do not
purchase such basic toiletries.
   Adding log-expenditure per capita in the models does not change the impor-
tance of all the other indicators much. The overall explanatory power of the
model remains the same and the coefficients and t-values of all other variables
change very little. This means that the expenditure variable is not correlated to
the combination of the other explanatory factors included in the model so as to
alter the model considerably. In fact, the expenditure variable is not significant.
This suggests that the nonmonetary food score indicator is not correlated with
the monetary indicator. The FCS cannot be improved significantly by simply
using cash assistance and may require a separate and tailored assistance program.
Perhaps one alternative option would be to offer storage facilities such as a fridge
in place of financial assistance as this is one of the variables that was found to be
important whether we included expenditure into the equations or not.
   Another indication of how close the FCS and expenditure are can be sought
by cross-tabulating the groups of monetary- and food-deprived refugees. For this
exercise, we use median values of the predicted probabilities of being food and
monetary vulnerable as cut-off points to define the four groups. Table 3.7 shows
the results. The largest of the four groups depicted by the cross-tabulation are
those on the diagonal, meaning those for which food and monetary vulnerability
concord. These two groups together account for almost 53 percent of observa-
tions. If there was no relation between food and monetary vulnerability, we
should expect a random allocation of observations in the four cells, which means
values of 25 percent in each of the cells. Table 3.7 is not far from that random
allocation, confirming that food and monetary vulnerability are not closely asso-
ciated. If we assume that targeting the monetary vulnerable was enough to

      Combining results from table 3.6 and table 3.7, we conclude with a certain degree
      of accuracy that food and monetary vulnerability are not closely associated.

      Crowding vulnerability model
      We now repeat the exercise on nonmonetary vulnerability using the CI. The CI
      measures the number of people in a case per room. We will use the logarithm
      transformation of the index in order to have a bell-shaped distribution and com-
      ply with OLS requirements. As for the FCS, we consider a model with and
      without expenditure as an explanatory variable. We also repeat the variables
      selection process for each of the two models with and without expenditure.
          Table 3.8 presents the results (columns 1–3). As a first observation and in
      contrast to the FCS, the set of explanatory variables retained by the best model
      is very large. It includes some of the recurrent variables, such as place of origin
      and destination, and adds several other variables related to the migration path
      (border crossing), characteristics of the PA of the case (employment, age, marital
      status, and gender), and other characteristics of the case (housing, food, type of
      income, coping strategies). Interestingly, while it is expected to find variables
      related to housing, other variables such as coping strategies are less obvious but
      still very important. The proportion of children and the age of the PA are posi-
      tively correlated to crowding as expected, while female PAs are associated with
      lower crowding. PAs with higher skills are instead associated with higher crowd-
      ing, a result that is probably associated with larger case sizes. Most of the retained
      variables have a high significance level and the overall explanatory power of the
      model is high (65 percent).
          Adding the log of expenditure as explanatory variable (columns 4–6)
      improves on the explanatory power of the model by 2 percent. The expenditure
      variable is significant and with a negative sign as expected. Therefore, we find a
      relationship between the nonmonetary crowding indicator and the monetary
      expenditure indicator when controlling for all the other explanatory factors pres-
      ent in the model. Interestingly and unlike the FCS model, the set of variables
      retained by the CI model with and without expenditure is slightly different. The
      model without expenditure does not retain electricity and volume of bulk water
      storage, whereas the model with expenditure does not retain three of the wash
      variables and one of the coping variables. These differences are probably
      explained by the correlation between expenditure and the variables that are dif-
      ferent in the two models.

    To test in more detail the relationship between monetary and nonmonetary
vulnerability, we show the cross-tabulation of monetary and crowding vulnerabil-
ity, as we did for food, in table 3.9. The table shows that 77.8 percent of observa-
tions are equally classified vulnerable or non-vulnerable by the crowding and
monetary dimensions. This is a much greater share of the 53 percent we found
for food and monetary vulnerability and indicates quite clearly that the relation-
ship between crowding and monetary vulnerability is quite far from a random
process. Hence, addressing crowding using financial means is not a bad policy. It
is not perfect, of course, as 32.3 percent of the time we may miss the target, but
it is close enough to consider treating crowding with cash rather than using alter-
native nonfinancial means such as providing shelter or accommodation.


Conclusions
The chapter exploited a recent strand of the economic literature to study vulner-
ability to poverty of refugees from the Syrian Arab Republic using monetary and
nonmonetary dimensions. In particular, we used a model proposed by Chaudhuri
et al. (2002) that allows us, under certain assumptions, to estimate vulnerability
using a single cross-section survey, which is the type of data we have.
   The estimations provided for monetary vulnerability clearly indicated that
poverty and vulnerability are two related but quite different concepts. The same
predictors may behave quite differently for poverty and vulnerability, sometimes
with opposite signs. For example, we found that higher education is character-
ized by higher expenditure today and that this factor contributes to decreased
vulnerability in the future. On the contrary, cases whose PA is widowed experi-
ence both lower expenditure today and higher vulnerability tomorrow. We also
found that poverty can be higher than vulnerability and the contrary can also be
true. This ranking is explained by the share of observations that are expected to
enter and exit poverty but also by the set level of the poverty line. Hence, results
are very sensitive to the choice of poverty line.
   The application of the methodology to estimate vulnerability to nonmonetary
dimensions provided some important insights. We selected two rather popular
indicators of nonmonetary deprivation: the WFP’s FCS and the UNHCR’s CI
and the estimations of vulnerability in these two dimensions provided quite dif-
ferent results. The work on the FCS showed that it is difficult to find predictors
for the food score. The full analysis of all possible predictors resulted in a rather
narrow set of variables retained by the final model. The explanatory power of the
120                                  The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      FCS model was also very low, only 10 percent. By contrast, the final model used
      for the CI retained many more variables, most of which were found to be signifi-
      cant, with the result that the overall explanatory power of the model was found
      to be high at 65 percent.
         Moreover, when expenditure is added to the model, it behaves differently
      between the FCS and CI models. With the FCS model, the effect is not signifi-
      cant and expenditure does not add anything to the explanatory power of the
      model. With the CI model, the effect of including expenditure is significant and
      the explanatory power of the model increased to 67 percent.
         We then cross-tabulated vulnerability in the food and crowding dimensions
      with monetary vulnerability and found the distribution of food and monetary
      vulnerabilities to be almost random across the four cells defined by the two vari-
      ables and their two modalities. This confirmed that food and monetary vulnera-
      bility are not closely related. Policies that address monetary vulnerability such as
      a cash transfer may not help in addressing food vulnerability, an important lesson
      for policy makers. Conversely, the cross-tabulations between crowding and mon-
      etary vulnerability showed a high association between these two phenomena. For
      77.8 percent of observations, the two criteria provided the same outcome in
      terms of vulnerability. Hence, addressing crowding with a cash transfer is not a
      bad approach to address the question of crowding.


      Notes
       1. See Ceriani (2015) for a more in depth discussion of these concepts.
       2. The difference in number of observations is due to the fact that the models use dif-
          ferent sets of variables and not all variables are observed for all cases.

Introduction
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was estab-
lished by the General Assembly in 1950 to provide protection and assistance to
persons fleeing war, persecution, and violence, and to coordinate solutions for
them. For more than six decades, UNHCR has been a front-line responder to
refugee emergencies. In the first instance, assistance and protection delivered to
refugees by UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations takes predominantly
the form of essential, life-saving, and life-preserving interventions—shelter, food,
water and sanitation, health, and physical security. Once refugee circumstances
stabilize, the challenge becomes one of enabling them to live as normal a life as
possible. The key objective is to encourage a transition out of dependency on
humanitarian assistance toward greater resilience and self-reliance.
    Emergency assistance interventions find their rationale in the need to meet
immediate humanitarian imperatives. The initial expectation for any refugee
situation is that it is temporary and will eventually be resolved. But this rationale
breaks down when the humanitarian crisis persists, as in the crisis of refugees
fleeing the Syrian Arab Republic. Over time, it becomes more difficult to raise
funds to sustain aid to refugees. Humanitarian agencies are therefore required to
increase program efficiency with less money and hosting countries understand-
ably seek support to address the additional economic and social costs they bear.
New issues related to the longer-term impact and consequences of the refugee
presence at local and national levels emerge. They affect both refugee and local
populations and cannot easily or effectively be addressed by humanitarian
interventions.
    Notwithstanding the expectations of an early resolution to refugee situations,
experience indicates that in the majority of cases they last for long periods. Over
70 percent of current refugee situations globally have evolved into complex pro-
tracted exile. As refugee communities start to stabilize, tents and temporary
shelter give way to more permanent housing arrangements; service provision

      becomes more routine; and informal employment, trade, and the establishment
      of small enterprises increase. Forms of social capital and organization emerge and
      provide a sense of quasi-normality, whether in camps or in refugee communities
      in urban contexts. After the initial emergency period, assistance for immediate
      humanitarian requirements recedes but is generally not replaced by programs
      with a longer-term vision. This is attributable to many factors, including donor
      and government policies that do not normally provide for the engagement of
      development funding for refugee situations.
          Refugees remain outsiders who are confined largely to the socioeconomic
      margins of their place of exile, unable to enjoy the full rights of citizens of a
      country. All too often, they remain aid dependent with limited opportunities for
      social and economic development. Four years into the Syrian refugee crisis, it is
      not difficult to anticipate that Syrians run the same risk of protracted displace-
      ment as many other refugee situations. The conflict in Syria shows few signs of
      abating; the prospects for safe and early repatriation on any significant scale look
      distant. Signs of growing impoverishment within the Syria refugee communities
      are already visible in the forms of high levels of indebtedness, asset selling, child
      labor, and early marriage. These trends do not bode well for the immediate wel-
      fare of the refugee population or for reducing dependence on humanitarian
      assistance. In addition, they raise questions about the capacity of refugees to
      rebuild the assets and acquire the skills to achieve greater self-reliance and to
      enable the pursuit of solutions.
          If the international response to the Syrian refugee crisis has generated histori-
      cally high and generous levels of humanitarian funding, there is nonetheless clear
      evidence of deepening poverty and growing destitution. This is of particular
      concern in light of the anticipated decline in immediate funding. It seems timely
      to review the likely trajectory of the present situation. How effective are existing
      policies toward Syrian refugees? And what are the alternatives to humanitarian
      assistance if, as seems likely, the Syrian refugee crisis persists for many years to
      come? These are the questions that we try to address in this chapter. The objec-
      tive is to assess the scope for the early introduction of developmental policies
      and programs that could help to shape different, more positive outcomes for
      refugees that might reduce aid dependency and assist refugees with attaining a
      more “normal” life.
          These questions are addressed using two simple analytical approaches. The
      first approach is a conventional targeting and welfare assessment of the current
      assistance programs. This approach tries to assess (i) how effective are targeting
      and the poverty reduction capacity of humanitarian assistance, and (ii) whether
      these programs can be improved by refining the targeting. This analysis is a
      response to donor demands for more efficient use of resources. The second
      approach is a policy simulation exercise based on microsimulation tools, wherein
      we ask what would happen to poverty and welfare if policies could change some
      of the current conditions of refugees such as education and work status. This
      analysis helps to respond to the question of whether, and how, alternative devel-
      opment policies might work in the context of a refugee population.

rent programs and potential alternative policies. The third section explains the
methodology employed and the fourth section outlines the results. The final
section concludes.


Programs and Policies for Refugees
The current assistance interventions for refugees are essentially structured
around two types of programs: the UNHCR cash assistance program and the
World Food Programme (WFP) food voucher program. These two programs are
implemented in both Lebanon and Jordan. They have seen changes over time,
partly as a result of diminished funding and partly as a result of improved admin-
istrative capacity.
    At the time of data collection, the UNHCR cash assistance program in Jordan
provided JD 50 per month to cases including one or two members, JD 100 to
cases with 3 to 5 members, and JD 120 to cases with more than five members.
The program was initially designed to be universal but, due to budget constraints,
it became targeted and administered only to eligible households. Eligibility
included a monetary income threshold of JD 50 per capita per month as well as
nonmonetary inclusion and exclusion criteria.1 This is the main program that we
will evaluate in this chapter (UNHCR 2014).
    Using both welfare and vulnerability criteria for targeting cash assistance is
justified from a UNHCR perspective due to the very nature of the refugee popu-
lation. Displacement due to armed conflict affects all parts of society. But it often
has a greater impact upon vulnerable groups of people and their equitable access
to assistance and protection, both in terms of immediate effects and upon their
ability to cope and remain resilient over the longer term. Individuals or groups
can be vulnerable due to their age, gender, religion, ethnicity, social, family or
legal status, marginalization from society, or from disabilities.
    Due to difficulties in accessing protection and assistance, vulnerable refugees
are more likely to revert to negative or harmful coping strategies such as remov-
ing children from school, engaging in child labor, selling off family assets, working
in dangerous conditions, survival sex, early marriage, and other practices that
impact family and individual welfare. One of the primary purposes of humani-
tarian assistance should therefore be to prevent vulnerable refugees from engag-
ing in negative coping mechanisms. This justifies prioritizing categories of
vulnerable refugees when it comes to targeting cash assistance.
    The UNHCR and WFP have also introduced other cash and vouchers pro-
grams. The UNHCR in Lebanon introduced a winter cash program with the
objective of keeping people warm during the cold season. The program provided
eligible households with the equivalent of US$147 in November 2013 and
US$107/month for the period December 2013 through March 2014 for a total
of US$575 over the winter period. An evaluation of the program (IRC 2014)
showed that the cash value of the program was insufficient to meet its objective
of keeping households warm. However, it helped families to cope with other
126                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      living expenses as income from other sources was found to be largely insufficient
      to cover basic needs, and it helped to increase school access and reduce child
      labor. The program also had a significant multiplier effect on the local economy.
      For each dollar spent, the program generated about US$2.13 in gross domestic
      product (GDP) for the Lebanese economy and had no significant impact on
      inflation. Interestingly, the study found that most beneficiaries prefer cash assis-
      tance to in-kind assistance and that cash assistance is usually spent responsibly.
          The WFP administers a food voucher program in both Jordan and Lebanon.
      At the time of data collection, the WFP program in Jordan included two bi-
      weekly vouchers for a total value of JD 24 per person per month. These vouchers
      were provided to the principal applicant (PA) and could be redeemed in 652
      designated stores covering all 12 governorates in the country. By January 2014,
      the program covered all the 440,000 refugees living in host communities (WFP
      2014a: 6). In its own evaluation, the WFP found that

           The program has also led to some US$2.5 million investment in physical
           infrastructure by the participating retailers; created over 350 jobs in the
           food retail sector; and generated about US$6 million in additional tax
           receipts for the Jordanian government. In terms of indirect effects, this
           study finds a predictive multiplier ranging from 1.019 to 1.234. In other
           words, WFP’s plan to distribute US$250 million in vouchers during 2014
           would lead to some US$255–US$308 million of indirect benefits for the
           Jordanian economy (WFP 2014a: 1).

         Due to financing pressures, the WFP was obliged to reduce their cash voucher
      value to US$17 per person per month and are rumored to be considering a fur-
      ther reduction. These changes demonstrate that humanitarian aid is by its very
      nature short term and not sustainable in the long run.
         The WFP food voucher program is also administered in Lebanon through
      e-cards. Families receive one e-card that is automatically charged every month
      with US$30 per person and these cards can be redeemed in any of the 300
      selected stores available across the country. The number of beneficiaries reached
      732,318 in May 2014 (about 70 percent of Syrian refugees). The WFP’s own
      evaluation found that the program had a large direct impact on participating
      stores, where revenue has doubled on average and created 1,300 jobs. The pro-
      gram has also led to US$3 million investments in capital expenditure, as larger
      stores have increased floor space and storage. The program has an estimated
      multiplier value of 1.51 in the food products sector (WFP 2014b).
         Hence, cash assistance and food voucher programs have an important effect
      on living standards and also an important multiplier effect on the local economy.
      These programs rely entirely on donors so typically their sustainability declines
      over time as donor support recedes. While initially designed as universal pro-
      grams, due to uncertain funding both the UNHCR cash assistance program and
      the WFP food voucher program are now using monetary and nonmonetary cri-
      teria to target refugees in both Jordan and Lebanon. Targeted programs can be
Policies                                                                                127


seen as an intermediary step toward discontinuation of the programs and the
reestablishment of normal living conditions. It is thus an important objective of
this chapter to evaluate their targeting capacity.
   Equally important is to simulate the potential impact on the welfare of refu-
gees of alternative policies for humanitarian assistance. The search for alternative
policies is compelling, given the funding status and prospects of current pro-
grams. It is also necessary if short-term humanitarian operations are to be supple-
mented or replaced by medium- and long-term development support.
   Humanitarian and developmental policies should also be cognizant of the
country context and, in this respect, comparing Jordan and Lebanon is instruc-
tive. The first difference between the two countries is that Jordan opted early on
to let refugees settle in urban areas and only later decided to establish camps
when the number of refugee arrivals grew sharply. Lebanon in contrast adopted
a policy of opposition to the establishment of camps from the very beginning.
This results in a difference in costs in hosting refugees. Work permits are another
policy area where we find differences across countries. Hosting countries are
typically reluctant to permit refugees to work due to domestic political sensitivi-
ties. When governments do permit refugees to work, the latter can be confronted
by many legal and administrative restrictions on employment, including the limit
of the number of work permits issued. For example, in Jordan, it is necessary to
have a valid passport, which many refugees do not have. Only selected profes-
sions are eligible and the work permit has a significant cost that varies between
JD 170 and JD 320 per year. It is employers rather than workers that apply for
work permits. A valid employment contract is required, which discourages both
employers and refugees from applying. For certain professions, the approval of
the unions is required to submit an application. Employers are allowed to hire
up to 60 percent of Syrians only in industrial areas. Although the process of
obtaining work permits is more streamlined in Jordan than in Lebanon, only
about 6,000 work permits have been issued to refugees as of March 2015,
despite the fact that Syrian refugees do not need a residency permit to obtain a
work permit unlike other nationalities. To start a business activity as self-
employed, refugees need an investor card, which is also difficult to obtain. In
contrast, formal employment regulations in Lebanon are less complex and the
enforcement of these regulations very weak, which makes access to existing job
opportunities less problematic.
   In terms of access to public services, the Ministry of Interior in Jordan issues a
service access card to refugees. This card provides refugees with free education
and health services, but there are also some restrictions. Only about half of Syrian
children attend public schools. This is partly explained by some costs that parents
have had to incur (such as uniforms and books) and by the limited number of
schools, particularly in areas of high concentrations of refugees. Understandably,
Jordan was neither prepared nor equipped to accommodate such a massive
increase in its population, particularly one that is rather different from its own as
shown in chapter 1. In Lebanon, the situation is even more complicated as the
provision of education is split equally between the public and the private sector.
128                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      Few Syrian refugee families can afford the cost of private education. To partially
      address these supply-side problems, both countries use double shifts. However,
      Syrian children tend to occupy the late shifts, with consequences on the level of
      attendance and a corresponding incidence of absenteeism and dropping out.
      Syrian-run schools are not encouraged and remain constrained to informal activi-
      ties behind closed doors.
         In an effort to contain demand, Jordan has now introduced an insurance sys-
      tem that applies to refugees. This system is relatively cheap and drugs and con-
      sultations remain heavily subsidized, but it is an additional cost for refugees.
      Despite this change, access to health care for refugees remains easier in Jordan
      than in Lebanon, where much of the health system is in the hands of the private
      sector. It is also evident that the demand for services is not limited to health care
      and education. Because of the very nature of their status, refugees need to con-
      tact a range of public and civil entities—courts, juvenile police, nurseries, civil
      registry, banking, car registry, and so forth. Access to all these services may be
      problematic and the sum of these difficulties becomes de facto an obstacle to
      seeking or keeping work.
         The opportunity to relocate and resettle to third countries also varies among
      different hosting countries and does not relate only to the final receiving country.
      For example, in Jordan a valid document and an exit permit to expatriate are
      required and once refugees have it is not possible to return to Jordan. In 2014,
      only about 6,000 people were selected for resettlement to third countries.
         In essence, the status of refugee brings about a variety of difficulties and con-
      straints in accessing work and services. Opportunities may vary depending on the
      host country but it is obvious that what would normally be simple and routine
      activities for a regular population turn into complex and costly endeavors for a
      refugee population. This prevents refugees from making the most of their skills,
      abilities, and assets.


      Methodology
      Targeting evaluation
      The first objective of this chapter is to assess the targeting capacity of the existing
      UNHCR cash assistance program in Jordan. UNHCR provides cash assistance to
      refugees based on a combination of monetary and nonmonetary criteria. As
      anticipated, the monetary criterion is a monetary threshold of JD 50/capita/
      month and the nonmonetary criteria include 11 conditions that the UNHCR
      considers for qualifying households as vulnerable. Note that, in this case, “vulner-
      able” does not refer to the monetary or nonmonetary vulnerability of cases as
      discussed in chapter 3 of the study; rather, it relates to specific conditions of the
      case, such as having a single mother as the PA or having a disabled person in the
      case. Cases must have at least one nonmonetary vulnerability criterion in addition
      to the monetary criterion to be eligible for cash assistance.
         We first simulate the UNHCR’s targeting process using the data at hand and
      the UNHCR eligibility criteria. This provides a sense of whether our data can
Policies                                                                               129


correctly estimate those who receive cash assistance in the data and thereby test
whether our data are suitable for assessing the targeting of the program. Next,
we compare targeting by using income or expenditure welfare measures. The
UNHCR uses income but chapter 2 of this study showed that expenditure is a
better measure of monetary deprivation than income. It is important therefore to
test what difference using one measure over the other makes. We then use stan-
dard targeting indexes to evaluate the targeting capacity of the program. These
include the coverage rate (the percentage of eligible cases who are targeted) and
the leakage rate (the percentage of cases targeted that are not eligible).
    Following the basic targeting analysis, we ask the question of how targeting
can be refined and whether it could be implemented at reduced costs. The cur-
rent purpose of the Home Visit (HV) is to measure income and expenditure
and determine who is and who is not eligible for cash assistance. This is an
important exercise but HVs are a time-consuming and costly process. For
example, even with the very efficient rate of 5,000 cases interviewed each
month (the current interview rate), it would require more than 2.5 years for
UNHCR to interview all 170,000 cases in Jordan. With a very reasonable cost of
US$20 per HV, the annual cost of this exercise is US$3.4 million. By the time
the exercise has finished, it would need to begin reassessing the first cases. Hence
there are important questions over the sustainability of the HV system itself in
its current form.
    One alternative is to estimate poverty and welfare using data from UNHCR’s
Profile Global Registration System (ProGres) (we refer to this data set as PG)
and a welfare model originally constructed on the Home Visits database, round
II (JD-HV2) (also referred to in this chapter as HV). For example, the welfare
model we constructed in chapter 2 of this study can be used to estimate welfare
for those cases that have not yet been visited and consequently reduce costs and
effort on the part of the UNHCR. The shortcoming of this approach is its ability
to predict (rather than directly measure) poverty and welfare. For example, when
we estimate poverty we estimate a probability of being poor, which varies
between 0 and 1, and not a poverty status, which can take only the values of 0
or 1. This leads to the problem of choosing which threshold to use to separate
the estimated poor from the estimated non-poor. This threshold is usually set at
50 percent, given that values above 50 percent indicate that the case has a higher
probability of being poor than not. However, it is evident that a case with 51
percent probability of being poor is not that different from a case with a proba-
bility of 49 percent. It is also evident that this choice affects the estimation of
both the leakage and the coverage rate. As a consequence, one may want to study
the optimal choice of probability threshold that would maximize coverage while
minimizing leakage. This threshold may be different from 50 percent but prefer-
able to 50 percent because of these max/min properties.
    Several methods have been proposed in the literature for choosing the opti-
mal threshold based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We
use two of the most common measures as shown below. The first measure is the
130                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      Youden index:
                                YI = max(Coverage—Leakage)

      where the optimal cut-off point is the one that maximizes YI, that is, the differ-
      ence between coverage and leakage. The second measure is the

      Distance index:



      where the optimal cut-off point is the one that minimizes the distance d from
      the scenario of perfect discrimination (that is the point (0, 1)), and where under-
      coverage is the proportion of poor classified as non-poor. We will use both indexes
      to test what is the optimal threshold to use to separate the poor from the non-
      poor and in order to maximize coverage while minimizing leakage. This allows
      us to statistically determine the best possible targeting outcome.
         As a final exercise in the targeting part, we will turn the targeting question
      around. Instead of counting the eligible cases and asking “what is the budget
      necessary to achieve optimal targeting?” we ask how to achieve optimal targeting
      given an available budget. This final exercise provides a sense of the cost of
      achieving different levels of coverage and leakage.

      Policy simulations
      Following the targeting analysis, we provide simple simulations of the effects of
      different policy outcomes. The policy simulation model we use is derived from
      the welfare model illustrated in chapter 2. The general welfare model is described
      in equation 4.1:

      (4.1)

      where W = welfare measure (expenditure or poverty); P = vector of case and PA
      characteristics that can be affected by policies such as education or occupation,
      and X = vector of case and PA characteristics that cannot be affected by policy
      such as age or gender of the PA; ε = normally distributed error term with zero
      mean; and i = household number (case number in UNHCR data). The model
      described in equation 4.1 contains the final variables selected for the welfare and
      poverty models in chapter 2 of the study, which we saw are slightly different for
      the two models. The welfare model is estimated with an ordinary least squares
      (OLS) estimator and the poverty model with a logit estimator.
         To simulate a policy change, we will adopt cross-survey imputation methods.
      The basic idea is the following. First, we create a data set of all HV cases, includ-
      ing the original data set and its identical replication (we duplicate the data set)
      so as to create two identical subsamples. We code the original data set “0” and its
      duplicate “1”. Second, we take subsample “1” and substitute all welfare observa-
      tions (W—welfare and poverty) with missing values. Third, we introduce the
Policies                                                                                 131


policy change for one variable at the time and for all observations in subsample
“1”. For example, we increase the education level of the PA for all or a fraction
of these cases in subsample “1”. Fourth, we estimate equation 4.1 with subsample
                                                                          ^
“0” and use the estimated coefficients (α, β1, β2) to estimate welfare (W ) for
subsample “1”. Fifth, we compare mean welfare across subsamples “0” and “1”
and derive in this way the impact of the policy change on welfare. Formally we
estimate (equation 4.2):

(4.2)

where the “hats” represent estimated values and P’ represents the policy variable
containing the change.2
    As a second policy exercise we will also estimate margins for all modalities of
all policy variables considered. A margin is a predicted statistic based on a fixed
model where one or more of the modalities of a predictor are assumed to change.
For example, consider a policy variable that measures whether refugees work or
not. After the estimation of the poverty model we can estimate what would be
the probability of poverty if all refugees, rather than only a share of refugees,
would work. This predicted probability is called a margin. This exercise can be
repeated for all policy variables considered and can be thought of as a robustness
test of the multiple imputation exercise proposed above.
    Not all variables present in the HV questionnaire can be used for policy mod-
eling. As we said, some variables like age and gender cannot be affected by policy
and used for policy modeling. Other variables, such as place of origin or border
crossing, can no longer be affected with policies given that these events occurred
in the past. Other variables are excluded because they are not retained by the
final welfare model because of lack of significance. Evidently, only the final vari-
ables retained in the welfare model are those that have some effect on welfare.
And finally, not all variables are expected to have a large effect on welfare. As we
saw for the welfare model, the variables that significantly affect welfare and with
large coefficients are very few. This restricts policy simulations to a few variables,
and even within this restricted number of variables the simulated policies that
we propose may not be realistic or feasible. Therefore, we should consider these
simulations as rough benchmarks to understand whether or not intervening in
certain policy areas has the potential to really improve the welfare of refugees.
    The chosen variables for the policy simulations are the following:

Case size. This is the best predictor of welfare. The idea behind modeling this
variable is that cases do not necessarily correspond to families or households and
aid organizations may consider policies that encourage aggregation or disaggrega-
tion of cases. For example, families that wish to reunite may be given incentives
to do so, whereas cases that wish to split into further cases may be given incen-
tives to do so, depending on what we learn about the impact of these changes on
individual welfare.
132                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      House rented or owned. The rationale for modeling this variable is that aid orga-
      nizations may consider assisting refugees with shelter rather than cash assistance,
      either by providing shelter free of charge as in refugee camps or by covering
      expenses for rent. Simulating changes in the share of refugees who pay rent may
      provide some indications on the impact of these policies on welfare.
      Governorate of destination. The governorate of destination of refugees is deter-
      mined by the location of the available opportunities and by the opportunities for
      mobility within the country and other local factors. However, certain governor-
      ates offer better conditions than others and one may want to simulate what
      welfare would be like if refugees lived in different governorates. Of course, this
      is not the real welfare effect because refugees also self-select governorates based
      on their characteristics and means and we can only control for some of these
      factors. This is nevertheless a counterfactual to see if there is any potential in
      voluntary relocation policies agreed with the hosting government.
      Highest education of the PA. We know that educational attainment for Syrian refu-
      gees is bunched in the lower segments of education and that only about 50
      percent of the Syrian refugee children are in school today (see details in chapter
      1, section on educational attainment). This fact will evidently have an effect on
      the future head of households. Hence, it may be instructive to simulate how
      changes in the education of the head of the household (in better or worse) may
      affect the welfare of the case. Naturally, educational outcomes occur over genera-
      tions and education of the PA may have various effects on other variables. This
      particular simulation cannot take these factors into account; it is simply an
      instantaneous counterfactual showing changes in welfare if the PA had a differ-
      ent educational level.
      A binary variable for people who work or do not work. Using the income variable
      available in the HV data set, we could derive whether a case has at least one
      person working. We can use this variable to model what would happen to welfare
      if more people would work. This is evidently related to the refugee policies
      adopted by hosting countries and to the opportunities provided by local informal
      markets. But aid organizations can help to foster labor market inclusion and
      advocate to hosting nations to amend rules and regulations regarding work per-
      mits of refugees. Note that the HV data set had one variable indicating whether
      the case had a work permit. However, this variable was never significant in the
      welfare models and it was not retained in the final model.
      Former occupation. The data contain a variable on the former occupation of the
      PA, meaning the occupation the PA held before fleeing from Syria. This variable
      does not tell us much about current occupations, if any, but tells us whether PAs
      with various degrees of skills are more or less successful in improving the welfare
      of their cases. Policies cannot affect former occupations of course but they can
      help to improve on former occupations with retraining schemes, for example,
      which can improve the likelihood of being occupied or improving on current
      income.
Policies                                                                                133


A binary variable for the validity of the protection certificate. HV data include a
variable on the validity of the protection certificate. This is the key registration
document for the UNHCR and the one that gives access to UNHCR services. It
is therefore an important variable for welfare as also found in the welfare and
poverty equations. Here the policy is one of improving on the maintenance of
validity of the certificate and on its coverage. The corresponding simulation is to
simply attribute to a larger share of refugees a valid protection certificate.
Marital status. This is not really a policy variable as such. But we will be modeling
this variable because prolonged socioeconomic distress can lead to divorce and
separation, and we may want to test what is the negative effect on welfare that
such changes may imply. Policies in this case would be family counselling and
prevention policies for families at risk of division.
Formal arrival. In the welfare and poverty models we also used a variable that
captures whether refugees entered the country formally or informally. This vari-
able turned out to be significant in the models and it can be used for simulations.
The policy in this case would be those measures that can encourage refugees to
formally enter the country, even in the absence of essential documents.
   The simulations proposed control for the other independent variables retained
by the final welfare models, but they do not control for the structure of correla-
tions between the policy variables and all other variables retained by the model.
For example, changing the level of education of the PA may change other factors
in the case such as the level of education of the PA’s spouse and children, occupa-
tion, and other factors. The usual assumptions in regression models is that inde-
pendent variables are “independent” of each other and this is something we
tested in the preparation of the final welfare model so that this problem should
not make a very large difference for our results. However, it is also unreasonable
to assume that correlations between independent variables would not affect our
results. This is a limitation of the simple simulation model proposed.


Results
Targeting evaluation
As already discussed, the UNHCR in Jordan provides cash assistance to selected
households using welfare and vulnerability criteria for eligibility. As a first test,
we reproduced the UNHCR’s decision for assistance from the data, which is
based on income rather than expenditure. Using HV data, we are able to repro-
duce the UNHCR decision for cash assistance rather accurately, despite the fact
that not all inclusion and exclusion variables are present in the HV data. Table
4.1 shows our estimation of those who should receive cash assistance according
to our simulation of the UNHCR criteria against the actual decision taken by the
UNHCR. It can be seen that in only about 3.1 percent of cases we are not able
to reproduce the UNHCR decision, which may be explained by the fact that not
all inclusion and exclusion indicators are available. This also implies that the
UNHCR applies its cash decision rules rather accurately.

          Next, we test how income and expenditure compare for targeting. As a mea-
      sure of welfare, the UNHCR uses income instead of expenditure, which is a
      shortcoming in the light of the analysis presented in chapter 2 of this work. It is
      therefore instructive to test how the targeting capacity of the UNHCR would
      change if expenditure instead of income were to be used. As a first observation,
      it is clear that selecting the poor using income or expenditure results in a differ-
      ent welfare assessment. Table 4.2 crosses the poor and non-poor using income or
      expenditure criteria and it shows that the income criteria finds 21.2 percent of
      poor cases that result as non-poor according to expenditure criteria. There are
      also 5.4 percent of cases that are poor according to expenditure but not to
      income. Therefore, income and expenditure provide two different snapshots of
      who is poor. This is partly explained by the fact that many cases have a reported
      income of zero and these cases fall under the income poverty line whether this
      zero income accurately reflects the income situation or not.
          If we further test the cash assistance decision against the targeting that would
      have resulted if our expenditure welfare aggregate was used in place of income,
      we will find that those who should have been but were not targeted are a very
      small share (0.4 percent), slightly smaller than those excluded using income
      (table 4.3). Instead, we find that the cash assistance decision based on income
      includes 10 percent more cases than it should have included if expenditure was
      used as a welfare criterion. This can be explained by the fact that—income being
      lower than expenditure on average—targeting based on income is more

“inclusive” than targeting based on expenditure. Therefore, while expenditure is
a better measure of welfare for welfare modeling and for targeting purposes, it
can result in a higher percentage of cases excluded because of non-eligibility.
    We now measure the coverage and leakage rates of the UNHCR cash assistance
decision based on income and expenditure criteria. The coverage rate is defined as
the percentage of poor cases that are targeted. The leakage rate is defined as the
percentage of beneficiaries who are non-poor. Of course, one should consider that
these rates take into account two factors. One is the “error” made by using income
instead of expenditure. This can be assessed by comparing coverage and leakage
rates between income and expenditure criteria. The leakage rate is the “error”
made due to the fact that vulnerability inclusion and exclusion criteria are used
in addition to poverty criteria. This can be checked by looking at the coverage
and leakage criteria of the income decision if true welfare is income in table 4.4.
    Technically, none of these are “errors”; these simply reflect decisions taken by
the UNHCR in the targeting methodology. If the UNHCR wished to change the
methodology and used only poverty criteria and expenditure in place of income,
then these errors would be largely reduced. As can be seen from table 4.4, if
expenditure was the real measure of household welfare but income was used for
targeting, then the leakage rate would be quite high (27.4 percent) while cover-
age would be 52 percent. If, vice versa, income was the real measure of welfare
and also the measure used for targeting, then leakage would be much lower and
coverage marginally lower. However, chapter 2 of this study has shown that expen-
diture is the best option to measure welfare with available data. This means that,
as it stands, the UNHCR decision based on income leads to a rather large leakage.
If the UNHCR shifted to expenditure for the purpose of targeting, this would
create some savings that could be used to expand coverage of beneficiaries.
    Finally, we can measure the impact of UNHCR cash assistance and WFP food
voucher programs on poverty. This is reported in table 4.5 where we can see that
the pre-transfer poverty rate of 69.2 percent is reduced to 61 percent with
UNHCR cash transfers alone; to 32.3 percent with the WFP food voucher alone;

                          and to 16.6 percent with both UNHCR cash assistance and WFP food voucher
                          programs. These rates derive from the difference in coverage of the UNHCR and
                          WFP programs. If we assume full coverage of both programs, the UNHCR and
                          WFP programs have a very similar and very large impact on poverty. Moreover,
                          this table does not include other forms of assistance that refugees may receive
                          from other organizations. Taking other assistance into consideration, we can con-
                          clude that aid to refugees has the potential to eliminate poverty altogether if we
                          consider as poor those cases with expenditure per capita less than JD 50 per
                          person per month.
                             In conclusion, there is little doubt that the UNHCR cash assistance and the
                          WFP food voucher programs have a strong poverty reduction capacity in their
                          current form and that there are some margins to further improve targeting. The
                          question on how to improve on targeting while containing costs is assessed next.

                          Optimal targeting
                          As described in the methodological section, the objective of this part is to deter-
                          mine the optimal probability threshold to maximize coverage and minimize
                          leakage. We do this using the available HV data but the same idea can be applied
                          if only PG data were available. The coverage-leakage graph already shown in
                          chapter 2 of the study is replicated in figure 4.1 in the case of using only the
                          monetary threshold (figure 4.1, panel a) and in the case of adding to the mone-
                          tary threshold the nonmonetary vulnerability criteria used by the UNHCR (fig-
                          ure 4.1, panel b).
                             Using only the monetary criteria, we obtain a high value of the area under the
                          ROC curve (AUC) index of performance (0.88), showing that the poverty
                          model proposed in the previous chapter is able to predict the true poverty status
                          very well. By adding the nonmonetary vulnerability criteria, we find an AUC

measure of performance equal to 0.79, which is smaller than the previous sce-
nario. Therefore, adding the vulnerability criteria on top of the welfare criteria
does not improve on the coverage/leakage optimization. Indeed, some of the
vulnerability criteria used by the UNHCR were already part of the welfare
model used to construct predictions or, if they were not, it means that these
variables were not associated with welfare. This indicates that, if the purpose of
targeting is primarily monetary, it is not advisable to mix monetary and nonmon-
etary criteria because this will decrease rather than increase the targeting capac-
ity of the model.
   Next, we compute the Youden index and the distance index illustrated in the
methodological section (figure 4.2). In general, the two indicators (Youden and
distance index) may suggest different optimal thresholds. In our case, we find the
two values rather close, 0.706 for the Youden index (corresponding coverage,
0.758; corresponding leakage, 0.182) and 0.693 for the distance index (corre-
sponding coverage, 0.77; corresponding leakage, 0.195).
   The analysis thus far has focused on the poverty rate for individuals (the
population). We can also repeat the exercise estimating the poverty rate for cases,
meaning the share of cases (rather than individuals) who are poor. The bottom
two panels in figure 4.2 show the results. In this case, the Youden and distance
indexes provide exactly the same values. Since the ROC curve is symmetric

                          around the negative diagonal of the unit square, the two decision rules point to
                          the same optimal threshold of 0.513. Therefore, if we consider as poor the cases
                          whose predicted probability (obtained from the poverty model previously pro-
                          posed) is greater than 0.513 and as non-poor the cases below this optimal cut-off
                          point, then we are minimizing both the distance from the perfect discrimination
                          scenario and maximizing the trade-off between coverage and leakage. Using this
                          optimal cut-off point, the coverage is 80.5 percent and the leakage 21.2 percent.
                             As an alternative, it is possible to select the optimal probability threshold
                          using the available budget for the cash program as a baseline. The UNHCR
                          would normally know the budget available for targeting. This budget can be used
                          to select the probability threshold that provides the optimal trade-off between
                          coverage and leakage. For example, imagine that the UNHCR had only JD 5 mil-
                          lion per month to run a cash assistance program that provides JD 100 per month
                          to each case. Figure 4.3 plots probability threshold, coverage rate, and leakage
                          rate for various budget constraints. By drawing the line in correspondence of the
                          JD 5 million budget we can derive the probability threshold for selection of the
                          eligible cases and the corresponding coverage rate and leakage rate. In this

particular case, the threshold would be around 82 percent, coverage just above
60 percent, and leakage around 10 percent. These instruments can be used, for
example, to provide an indication to donors of the success rate of the cash pro-
gram for each level of financing.

Policy simulations
We now turn to the simulations of alternative policies to humanitarian assistance.
To be clear, what we mean by policy simulations is to simulate the outcome in
terms of poverty and welfare of changes in the attributes of individuals and cases.
These are therefore indirect simulations in the sense that we do not simulate, for
example, a change in labor legislation and measure the impact of this change on
welfare. Rather, we simulate the impact of a change in attributes such as work
status on poverty and welfare on the assumption that a change in labor legislation
can lead to more people working and, through this effect, improve people’s wel-
fare. By simulating changes in attributes, we are implicitly simulating the impact
of any policy on welfare that works through the changes in these attributes.
   Table 4.6 summarizes the results of selected policy simulations on the vari-
ables that we discussed in the methodology part. We simulate gross and rather
unrealistic changes to amplify the effect and see whether such policies have any
impact on welfare. Table 4A.1 in annex 4A provides poverty and welfare statis-
tics for all policy variables and their modalities to better understand how changes
in modalities in policy variables may affect policy outcomes. Table 4A.2 in annex
4A provides the margins—which we said are the probabilities of poverty if all
individuals moved to a particular category—and function as robustness tests to
the multiple imputation simulations.
   In the first simulation, we reduce the case size to a maximum of five members
by turning all cases with six members and above to five members. Recall that
household size is the best predictor we found for both welfare and poverty. This

      policy would reduce the poverty headcount by over six percentage points and
      improve expenditure per capita by about JD 4.84/person/month. This is a large
      effect. If we look at the poverty and welfare statistics of the case size variable in
      table 4A.1, we see that poverty is a monotonic increasing function of case size
      and a monotonic decreasing function of welfare. The same can be said for the
      margins, which are all significant in table 4A.2.
         Evidently, changes in the size of the case can only occur on a voluntary basis
      and these changes may have implications for other indicators that relate to wel-
      fare. For example, the splitting of a case into two parts results in the multiplication
      of cases and number of shelters needed. Recall that these simple simulations con-
      sider “everything else being equal” and therefore assume that the splitting of a case
      results in identical conditions on all other variables. Hence, the policy here could
      be that, for cases who wish to split and have some but not all the means to do that,
      aid organizations may encourage this process by providing financial assistance.
         The second simulation consists in turning all cases who are not renting into
      cases who are renting. Note that renting here signals cases that are better off and
      can afford to rent houses or apartments, so that the policy here would be to
      provide cases who are in temporary or makeshift accommodation with free
      accommodation or subsidized rent. The effect is small and estimated in a poverty
      reduction of 1.03 percentage points and an improvement in expenditure per
      capita per month of JD 1.3. Table 4A.1 shows that there is a big difference
      between renting/owning a property or not, about 24 percentage points higher in
      the poverty rate and about JD 159/person/month in welfare in favor of renting/
      owning. The poverty margins in table 4A.2 also show that, if all cases were rent-
      ing or owing the property they live in, then the poverty rate would be lower at
      68 percent as compared to 87 percent if all cases were not renting or owning.
      Hence, this is a case where statistics would initially suggest that supporting cases
      with shelter and free rent for those in makeshift accommodations would have a
      great impact on welfare; but once we control for other factors as we do in our
      model, this effect is smaller.
         The third simulation foresees a hypothetical change in governorate of destina-
      tion by “moving” all refugees currently in Mafraq and Zarqa to Aqaba. This is not
      a policy that we would suggest but simply a counterfactual exercise that answers
      the question of “what if” refugees went to the south of the country rather than
      relocating to the north. The policy is massive, given that most refugees are in
      Mafraq and Zarqa, but the effect is small, only a 1.67 percentage points reduc-
      tion in the poverty headcount. The effect on welfare is also small with only a
      JD 1.62/person/month improvement. The difference in poverty between Mafraq
      and Zarqa on the one hand and Aqaba on the other hand is about 17 percentage
      points (table 4A.1). This is a case where the statistics are not really in line with
      the margins in table 4A.2. Here we find that if all refugees were located in
      Mafraq, then the probability of poverty would be 68 percent, one of the lowest
      values across governorates. Hence, results are not clear-cut and this is explained
      by the fact that multiple imputations and margins estimates control for all the
      factors used in the equations while simple statistics do not.
Policies                                                                                 141


    The fourth set of simulations is on the education level of the PA. The policy
simulation here is to increase or decrease all cases by one level of education. The
effect is small on poverty and very small on welfare. Statistics on poverty and
welfare according to the various degrees of the PA education (table 4A.1) show
that poverty decreases and welfare increases with education. But the changes,
especially at low levels of education, are not very large, as also shown by the
margins (table 4A.2) and these effects disappear once we control for other fac-
tors. Hence, improving education in an environment with little return to educa-
tion does not improve welfare. This is an important finding. There is a high
concern about the fact that only half of refugee children are not in education and
the possible future implications for human development of the Syrian popula-
tions. These are legitimate concerns; but there seems to be less concern about
returns from education and more concern about the possibility that educating
people with no obvious use for education can become socially explosive. It is of
course essential to keep a focus on education for short-, medium-, and long-term
development goals, but it is equally important to address the factors that make
returns to education so low.
    The fifth set of simulations is about work and former occupations. We first
turn all those cases who declared having no income from work into working
cases. Surprisingly, we can see that this has no effect on poverty or welfare.
Indeed, table 4A.1 shows no difference in poverty and mean expenditure
between working and non-working cases and table 4A.2 shows that margins are
very close. This would suggest that those who work do so in very precarious,
informal, and low-income jobs, as expected for refugees who are not entitled to
work. Hence, work is not what we would expect in a normal working environ-
ment and returns from work are very close or even inferior to what the cash and
voucher programs may provide. In other words, the reservation wage represented
by the cash assistance program is high. However, the fact that the program is
close to the poverty line and the fact that working individuals are not automati-
cally excluded from the program would suggest that the program is unlikely to
discourage refugees from work, whereas it may prevent refugees from taking up
illegal or dangerous occupations.
    The second labor market policy we simulate is to increase the former occupa-
tion level for all cases by one level in the set of four skill levels we created. This
has a small effect on poverty (minus 1.4 percentage points) and a very marginal
effect on welfare (plus JD 0.5/capita/month). Recall that occupational skills here
refer to those before the flight to Jordan and this may explain in part the small
effect of improving these skills on poverty. Also note from table 4A.1 that those
with the lowest poverty and highest welfare are either those with no skills or
those with professional skills. These seem to be the two groups that do better in
the Jordanian labor market and it may explain why increasing skills for everyone
will not improve welfare on average. Table 4A.2 also shows that the difference in
margins are very small across the skills categories, indicating that acquiring differ-
ent skills would not make much of a difference although professionals stand out
as those with the lowest probability of poverty. Here the central question is not
142                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      how to provide refugees with the right level of skills—which sometimes would
      counterintuitively imply reducing skills—but how aid agencies can help hosting
      governments to create the conditions to improve returns on skills for refugees.
      Again, as for education, the problem is that increasing skills does not equate to
      more work as would be the case for a regular population in a regular labor
      market.
          We then simulate the impact of turning all those with an invalid protection
      certificate into a valid one. The implied policy is to improve the coverage and
      validity of the certificate. The impact on poverty and welfare is very small (minus
      0.6 percent and plus JD 0.4, respectively). This result is explained by the low
      effect of this variable on welfare. The difference in welfare between cases with
      valid and invalid certificates is significant and estimated at almost 10 percentage
      points as shown in table 4A.1, although the difference is reduced if we look at
      margins (a difference of 4 percentage points). Hence, this policy is not very
      promising, particularly considering the fact that the UNHCR already works hard
      to keep protection certificates valid and to increase their coverage.
          Policies that help refugees to enter the hosting country formally are more prom-
      ising. Here we simulate that all informal entrants are turned to formal entrants.
      This policy reduces poverty by 2.4 percentage points and would increase welfare
      by JD 1.7/person/month. We can see a significant difference in statistics between
      the two statuses (table 4A.1 shows a difference of 17.6 percent), although the dif-
      ference in margins is much smaller (table 4A.2 shows a difference of 4 percent).
          Finally, we simulate changes in marital status. Here we simulate a negative
      “policy” by turning all married or engaged people into divorced or separated.
      That enables us to see the effect of deteriorating conditions on families, which
      would lead to social tensions within the family. Surprisingly, the effect is large,
      the largest after the simulations on case size. The poverty rate increases by 4.6
      percentage points and the welfare decreases by JD 3.6/capita/month. This is in
      line with the margins in table 4A.2, which show the probability of poverty is
      lower if one is married or engaged as compared to divorced and separated.
      However, statistics in table 4A.1 show instead that poverty is much higher for
      married and engaged people (19 percentage points difference). This is explained
      by the fact that once we control for other characteristics of the case (case size in
      particular), the probability of being poor is reversed, with married people being
      at reduced risk of poverty as compared to divorced or separated ones.
          How different would these simulations be if we were working with data on
      Syrians before the crisis? We focus, in particular, on an education-related policy
      simulation, which increases by one level the education attained by the PA (see
      table 4.7). We simulate this policy on both the Syrian refugees in Jordan (refer-
      ring to the JD-HV2 data) and the Syrian population before the crisis (referring
      to the Syrian Household Budget Survey 2007). In order to be able to compare
      this policy on both populations, we consider a reduced welfare model based on
      covariates that are included in both datasets: case size; age, marital status, and
      education of the PA; having a house made of concrete; having a house with
      kitchen; and renting or owning the house. As a result of the reduced welfare

model, the results referring to the Syrian refugees in table 4.7 are different from
the ones in table 4.6. From table 4.7 we note that the policy simulation under
consideration increases welfare in both populations. However, the effect is almost
double for the Syrian population before the crisis as compared to the Syrian refu-
gee population (9.7 percent versus 5.2 percent, respectively). As expected, refu-
gee status reduces significantly returns to education.


Conclusions
The chapter has evaluated the targeting performance of the existing UNHCR
cash transfer and the poverty reduction capacity of the UNHCR cash program
and the WFP food voucher. It then developed a methodology to fine-tune target-
ing whether the cash assistance system is driven by demand or by the available
budget. Finally, the chapter looked into the potential for alternative policies to
humanitarian assistance that would affect various attributes of refugees.
   Targeting cash assistance programs is now a common practice for the UNHCR,
as dictated by reduced funds for the Syrian refugee crisis. The targeting method-
ology practices at the time of data collection relied on income and on a set of
nonmonetary inclusion and exclusion criteria. This targeting resulted in very
good coverage but excessive leakage. One way to reduce leakage with contained
negative effects on coverage is to use expenditure rather than income for target-
ing purposes. That is due to the fact that income is underestimated as compared
to expenditure and a large share of cases report zero income even when expen-
diture is sizeable.
   We then proposed a methodology to fine-tune targeting using two common
indexes, the Youden index and the distance index. The indexes are designed to
provide a rule on how to maximize coverage while minimizing leakage. We
showed that both indexes provide similar results, whether applied to individuals
or cases. We also showed that these methods can be applied starting from the
demand side, by counting first the number of beneficiaries to cover, or starting
from the supply side, by counting the budget available for the cash assistance
program. These can be useful instruments for the UNHCR for planning purposes
and for donors to see the potential impact of specific amounts of aid in terms of
coverage and leakage.
   Next, we simulated the impact on poverty and welfare of changing the attri-
butes of the refugee population, and in this way simulating the indirect effects of
144                                 The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      policies that affect these attributes. We found important poverty and welfare
      effects of policies that can affect the case size and, to a minor extent, policies that
      relate to family stability such as marriage and divorce. We found weak effects or
      null effects for policies that affect the level of education, skills, or work status of
      the PA. The reasons are simply explained. Due to their status, refugees live in an
      environment where returns to education and skills are almost nil. Returns to
      work are so low that we do not observe any difference between those who work
      and those who do not.
         The reservation wage represented by the cash assistance program is high.
      However, the fact that the program is close to the poverty line and the fact that
      working individuals are not automatically excluded from the program suggests
      that the program is unlikely to discourage refugees from working, whereas it may
      prevent refugees from taking up illegal or dangerous occupations. More formal
      work through work permits is hard to obtain as witnessed by the small number
      of refugees who obtained this status. But more formal work would provide
      greater revenue for the government besides offering greater opportunities for
      improved working conditions for refugees. Nevertheless, the simulation suggests
      that income from work of these refugees does not stand out as a poverty-reduc-
      ing mechanism, given that presently the work permit variable is almost invariably
      non-significant in the welfare and poverty models.
         When we compare the results of these simulations with the results of the
      targeting analysis, we can derive a few additional lessons for policy. The most
      effective policies for reducing poverty and increasing welfare are presently rep-
      resented by humanitarian assistance, cash transfers, or food vouchers, which are
      the current policies adopted by the UNHCR and WFP, respectively. That is
      because these programs provide a significant percentage of total expenditure of
      the cases. Substituting this policy with alternative policies related to education,
      skills, or location is not expected to be as effective as cash transfers for the reasons
      explained above.
         The environment in which refugees live with few labor market opportunities
      reduces returns to education and skills significantly. In fact, it changes returns in
      ways that we would not expect in a regular labor market, for example by making
      high-skilled refugees less successful than the skilled ones. The policies that appear
      to offer more potential impact in terms of welfare are also those more complex
      to apply, such as changes in case size or renting/ownership status. The results
      suggest that a more promising policy to consider relates to housing policies for
      refugees outside camps, with perhaps a controlled system of rents agreed with
      local owners as a substitute for cash assistance. This would allow cases in make-
      shift accommodation to move into rented accommodation.
         What are the main implications of these simulations and what are the real
      alternatives to the current assistance programs? The results highlight the long-
      standing dilemma faced by humanitarian agencies in seeking to transition from
      emergency to longer-term programs. They suggest that there are no simple path-
      ways at the policy level to address the challenge of improving refugee welfare
Policies                                                                              145


and reducing poverty. They appear to confirm that the maintenance of current
humanitarian aid transfers offers the most effective way of supporting welfare
and reducing poverty among refugee populations. Yet the problems of aid depen-
dency and the sustainability of current programs remain. There are few, if any,
examples of large-scale humanitarian aid transfers being sustained beyond the
initial emergency phase.
    In the case of Lebanon and Jordan, the magnitude of the refugee population
presents policy dilemmas that are unusually sharp. The overall costs borne by the
respective governments continue to be very high. While support for continuing
humanitarian assistance has been generous, it is clearly insufficient to mitigate
the overall economic and social consequences. To date, no major policy shift has
occurred that would permit larger financing from multilateral and bilateral
sources to flow to governments hosting significant numbers of refugees. Such
financing might ease, if not necessarily overcome, domestic concerns related to
refugees being permitted greater access to the labor market, or refugees securing
access to private-sector financing to support resilience and self-reliance. With
respect to the return on supporting education and skills training, a more compre-
hensive analysis over a longer period might be required to reach firmer conclu-
sions about the contribution of education and skills to reducing poverty.
    Humanitarian crises persist over long periods of time, and rebuilding asset
bases, acquiring new skills, and developing social capital face many obstacles
while refugees are in exile. As a result, opportunities for refugees to reach their
pre-conflict status quo in their asylum country are necessarily limited. The les-
sons of this chapter suggest that further reflection is required on the policy
implications of refugee status for longer-term development programs. We recog-
nize the legal importance of refugee status and official documentation for the
purpose of protection and access to certain assistance services. However, the
analysis in this chapter points to the practical consequences of exclusion from
the full range of rights, obligations, and opportunities enjoyed by normal citizens
of a state. Moreover, the effectiveness and impact of longer-term development
investments on the specific character of refugee welfare and poverty is uncertain
without a policy and institutional environment that would enable refugees to
enjoy improved rights and opportunities.
    The dilemmas for asylum country governments and for donors are self-evident.
The prospects for transitioning out of humanitarian aid programs to longer-term
development support will likely remain constrained. Without a reexamination of
how a more equitable social contract can be developed between donors and the
governments of countries affected by major refugee emergencies, the status quo
will likely persist. Such a contract will need to recognize and reward the global
public good and services rendered by asylum countries in hosting refugee popu-
lations. It may also offer the possibility for policy adjustments that encourage
greater inclusion of refugee populations within mainstream economic and social
development processes, as well as longer-term interventions that enable refugees
to lessen their dependency on humanitarian assistance transfers.

       A Comparative Analysis across
            Countries and Data Sets

Introduction
The previous chapters of this report analyzed the welfare, poverty, and vulnera-
bility of refugees from the Syrian Arab Republic using the second round of the
Home Visits data in Jordan (JD-HV2). This data set is the most comprehensive
data set we had at our disposal and for this reason it was used to carry out most
of the core analysis in the report.
   The welfare and poverty analysis of chapter 2 of the report was replicated for
three other data sets: the third round of the Home Visits data in Jordan (JD-
HV3); the second round of the Lebanon Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian
Refugees (LB-VASyR); and the Lebanon Verification data set (LB-Verif), a
recent data set compiled using information collected during the appeal process
for the World Food Programme (WFP) food voucher distribution system. The
welfare assessments using these three data sets are provided in separate appen-
dixes available online (https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/
10986/23228/210770Appendix.pdf). In what follows, we will refer to these
appendixes as A, B, and C, representing, respectively, the analyses conducted on
data JD-HV3, LB-VASyR, and LB-Verif.
   The purpose of this chapter is to compare results on welfare and poverty
across these different countries and data sets. The comparative analysis is carried
out in two parallel processes. We first make an effort to compile the four data sets
into one harmonized data set. We harmonized the variables that could be harmo-
nized, transformed the welfare aggregates into comparable U.S. dollars at purchas-
ing power parity (PPP), and constructed a single poverty line. This allowed us to
compare countries and data sets using comparable indicators to the best of our
knowledge. The shortcoming of this exercise is that the harmonization process
restricted the number of indicators that could be compared and, even among the
indicators that we could compare, we had to address various types of comparabil-
ity issues. The second exercise is to compare the welfare assessments that focused
on the four different data sets (chapter 2 and online appendixes A, B, and C) and
try to extract lessons from this raw comparison. The advantage of this exercise is
that we can expand the comparisons to a much wider set of variables and avoid

      conversions into US$-PPP values. The disadvantage is that models built on indi-
      vidual data sets are less likely to be adaptable to different country contexts.
         Despite the shortcomings described, the chapter finds a set of core variables
      to be consistent across countries and data sets in their capacity to predict poverty
      and welfare. This is an important finding, because the four data sets considered
      are very heterogeneous in terms of samples, questionnaires, data collection meth-
      ods, and degree of representation of the underlying population of refugees. Such
      findings provide the UNHCR with a strong case for targeting the refugee popula-
      tion based on a rather restricted number of indicators and irrespective of how the
      samples, questionnaires, and data sets are constructed.
         The chapter is organized as follows. The next section summarizes the data and
      the third section presents a comparative analysis of the expenditure distributions.
      The fourth section presents results on inequality, followed by the fifth section on
      poverty. The sixth section illustrates results on welfare and poverty predictors,
      and the final section concludes.


      Data
      Data sets
      In this chapter we consider four data sets: The Jordan Home Visits II and III data
      sets (JD-HV2 and JD-HV3) as well as the Lebanon Vulnerability Assessment of
      Syrian Refugees (LB-VASyR) and the Lebanon Verification data sets (LB-Verif).
      These last three data sets are described in detail in online appendixes A, B, and
      C. The JD-HV2 and JD-HV3 data sets derive from the same Home Visits ques-
      tionnaire with the only difference that the JD-HV3 questionnaire has been
      improved and expanded in certain sections.
         The LB-VASyR data are a random sample of the refugee population in
      Lebanon and are expected to be representative of this population, although the
      sample is small. The LB-Verif data were collected by administering a short ver-
      sion of the same questionnaire used for the first round of the VASyR survey,
      which means that variables are similar for both data sets. However, the LB-Verif
      questionnaire was administered to cases that were excluded from the WFP food
      voucher program based on expenditure proxies. This last sample is large but is
      expected to include wealthier households than the refugee population in
      Lebanon as a whole as these cases appealed against exclusion from the food
      voucher program.
         In addition, data sets differed in the period of data collection, the unit of
      observation, the number of observations, the share of refugees covered, and the
      average household size. Table 5.1 provides basic information for the four data
      sets. We can see that the share of individual refugees observed varies from 1
      percent with the LB-VASyR data to 30.5 percent with the JD-HV2 data. The
      two Jordan and the two Lebanon data sets were collected in subsequent periods.
      The Jordan data sets used cases as the unit of observation while the Lebanon data
      sets used households, some of which combined different cases, particularly in the
      LB-Verif data. Also, the overall number of registered refugees was very different

in the two countries considered. Note that due to treatment of outliers and other
changes made for comparability purposes, the number of final observations used
in this chapter and corresponding means of all variables are not identical to the
appendixes that focused on the individual data sets.

Welfare aggregate
The four data sets have different expenditure questions that were used to con-
struct the expenditure aggregates (see annex 5A). The expenditure aggregate
constructed from the JD-HV2 data derives from a combination of two questions
on expenditure, one containing 6 items and a second question containing 10
items, while the expenditure aggregate constructed from the JD-HV3 data con-
tains 11 items. For Lebanon, the LB-VASyR aggregate includes 9 items while the
LB-Verif data aggregate contains 3 items. Differences in the number of items are
small and they are not expected to make a great difference in results. It is known
that welfare aggregates tend to be more precise if the number of reported items
is higher. This is the case when we consider, say, 10 items against 100 items, but
not if the difference relates to a few items as is the case in our sample. If the
expenditure data were collected with full expenditure questionnaires or diaries,
we would expect expenditure to be higher on average. However, our interest is
not so much on absolute levels of poverty, which are not very comparable across
countries, but on the relative importance of poverty across different socioeco-
nomic characteristics of the population and on the capacity of different variables
to predict welfare and poverty. In this respect, mean values of expenditure are
less important while what really matters is the distribution of expenditure.
Nevertheless, it is important to provide first an overview of mean expenditure to
see the scale of the differences across data sets.
    Table 5.2 compares mean expenditures per month per capita of the four data
sets. The welfare aggregate was transformed into US$-PPP. In addition, for com-
parability purposes with online appendixes A, B, and C, we also report expendi-
ture per capita in the local currency unit (LCU). Once we transform data in
US$-PPP values, mean expenditure per capita varies between US$136 and
US$183/capita/month, which is not surprising given the differences in data sets.
It is also noticeable that in both countries the data collected at later periods of

      pared with data collected in earlier periods.

      Predictors of welfare and poverty
      We also made an effort to harmonize key variables that are used as independent
      variables in the welfare and poverty models. Table 5.3 reports the means for
      these variables with “pa” indicating variables related to the principal applicant
      (PA) or household head and “hh” variables related to the case or the household.
      It is clear that these means are significantly different across data sets. For exam-
      ple, the share of PAs with nine and plus years of education or the share of PAs
      who are females are very different between the Jordanian and Lebanese data sets
      and this is partly due to the use of cases (Jordan) as opposed to households
      (Lebanon) as unit of observations. In general, the differences are due to question-
      naire or sample design. Differences in questionnaire design are indicated in the
      note of table 5.3. Differences in sample design were already outlined. In essence,
      none of the sample is strictly representative of the underlying populations of
      refugees and the underlying populations are different in Jordan and Lebanon as
      could be observed in chapter 1.

A Comparative Analysis across Countries and Data Sets                                                                                  153


   We consider the differences observed between data sets as an asset in our
study for two important reasons. The first relates to the comparison of absolute
levels of mean welfare, poverty, or inequality. These statistics are not strictly
comparable because of the differences discussed in terms of questionnaire design,
sampling, and welfare aggregates. However, if these statistics tend to converge to
similar levels and provide a similar snapshot of welfare, this is rather strong evi-
dence that results cannot be simply explained in terms of data collection meth-
odology or measurement errors. The second reason relates to the comparisons of
the predictors of welfare and poverty. If these predictors are consistent across
data sets, this would be a rather strong indication that such predictors are robust
to different data collection methods and measurement errors. In what follows, we
start by comparing absolute values of welfare, poverty, and inequality and we
then follow by comparing predictors across data sets.


Welfare Distributions
We can start by comparing the distribution of the expenditure aggregates across
the four data sets. For this purpose, we will use data weighted by household size so
that we are comparing distributions of individuals rather than distributions of cases.
Information about the entire expenditure distribution is provided in figure 5.1,
which shows the probability density function curves (panel a) and the cumulative
distribution function curves (panel b), respectively. We clearly observe that the
distribution of expenditure per capita in Lebanon estimated through the
LB-Verif data is shifted to the right in comparison to the other distributions
(panel a). This reveals that the proportion of poor individuals is much smaller in
the former than in the latter cases. On the contrary, the group of refugees inter-
viewed in JD-HV2 is more compressed around smaller expenditure levels, which
is shown by the fact that the distribution is shifted to the left as compared to the
others. We should expect, therefore, this last population to be poorer on average.

          Figure 5.1 (panel b) also reveals that the expenditure distribution of the
      LB-Verif data dominates the other distributions according to the criterion of
      first-order stochastic dominance. This means that the welfare of refugees in this
      data set is unequivocally higher along all the distribution as compared to the
      welfare of the other groups of refugees. This is the case because the LB-Verif
      questionnaire captures refugees who were already excluded from the WFP
      voucher program because of socioeconomic characteristics associated with wel-
      fare and are, therefore, better off. Instead, if we compare the two Jordanian dis-
      tributions or these two distributions with the LB-VASyR data, we see that the
      cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves cross at different levels of expen-
      diture. This indicates that the difference in expenditure is not unequivocally
      higher in one distribution or the other. Rather, certain distributions dominate the
      others in only parts of the distributions, while they are dominated by other dis-
      tributions in other parts.
          For example, it is possible to see from figure 5.1 (panel b) that the CDF curves
      for the JD-HV2, JD-HV3, and LB-VASyR data sets cross around values of
      US$100-US$120 PPP values. This indicates that below these values (indicating
      poorer people), there is one ranking of the three distributions (JD-HV2 is the
      poorest) while above these values the ranking is reversed (JD-HV3 is the poorest).
      It is also evident that the CDF curves cross multiple times, making the ranking
      between distributions change at each crossing point. This also implies that, if we
      change the poverty line, we may find that the highest poverty rate changes across
      the four data sets.


      Inequality
      Having a good sense of the distributions of expenditure, we can now measure
      and compare inequality. The average level of inequality (Gini coefficient) for all
      data sets considered is 0.39 (table 5.4) and this is using a top-coded distribution
      at US$3,000 PPP. This average level of inequality is high when compared to the
      Syrian population before the crisis (0.32 in 2007), to hosting countries (Jordan =
      0.34 in 2010 and Lebanon = 0.36 in 2005), and to other countries in the region
      such as the Arab Republic of Egypt (0.32 in 2009). It only compares to one of
      the highest Gini coefficients in the region, which is the one of Morocco (0.4 in

2007). However, the high inequality in Morocco is explained by the urban-rural
divide, which the Syrian refugees do not have because the population we con-
sider is almost exclusively hosted in urban areas. Indeed, we would have expected
inequality to be low because refugees rely on a reduced set of assets and income
opportunities and they tend to be a self-selected group of poorer people as com-
pared to the Syrian pre-crisis population. If we break down results by country
and data set, inequality among refugees in Jordan is higher than the inequality
measured for the hosting population, whereas in Lebanon inequality levels for
refugees are comparable to those of hosting populations. We can also see a
remarkable difference in inequality between the two data sets in Jordan.
    We have also tested whether these high levels of inequality are driven by the
tails of the distributions, particularly by the share of zero values for the bottom
of the distribution and by outliers for the top of the distribution. Table 5.4 shows
that, by removing the zeroes, inequality is still high for all countries with only the
Gini for JD-HV3 declining significantly. If we further remove outliers by capping
data to the lowest of the largest values across the four data sets (US$1,158 PPP),
we observe a further reduction in inequality although it is rather small for all data
sets. Therefore, inequality is high irrespective of the behavior of the expenditure
distributions on the tails.
    The levels of inequality are very different across data sets with the highest
value found in Jordan (JD-HV2). We can also observe that inequality declined in
Jordan and increased in Lebanon (if these samples were comparable). This can
be derived from the fact that the JD-HV3 data were collected subsequently to
the JD-HV2 data in Jordan (Nov. 2013–Oct. 2014 for JD-HV2 and July–Dec.
2014 for JD-HV3) while the LB-VASyR data were collected subsequently to the
LB-Verif data (Oct.–Dec. 2013 for LB-Verif and May 26–June 13, 2014 for
LB-VASyR). Therefore, expenditure inequality for Syrian refugees is high but
changes significantly across data sets and time.
    This is also confirmed by the Lorenz curves plotted in figure 5.2. The Lorenz
curve for JD-HV3 is the closest to the 45-degree line of equality, and, consequently,

                          its Gini index is the smallest. On the contrary, the Jordan-HV2 Lorenz curve is
                          the furthest from the case of equality, and its Gini index takes the highest value.
                          Hence, the most unequal group of refugees is found with JD-HV2 data. However,
                          the difference among the other three data sets is not as obvious. This can be seen
                          in the lower part of the Lorenz curves, which cross for some of the curves, and
                          also from table 5.4, from which we observe that the lower-bound and upper-
                          bound estimates can overlap across data sets. Distinctions between these three
                          data sets are more apparent in upper parts of the distributions but less in lower
                          parts of the distributions. This confirms what we found with the CDF curves and
                          the changes in ranking as we move along different parts of the distributions.
                              One may wonder what drives such high inequality. We tried to have an insight
                          into this question by decomposing the Gini index of both countries by type of
                          expenditure. In particular, we split expenditure into (i) food expenditure and (ii)
                          expenditure on non-food items, and compute the corresponding inequality. Table
                          5.5 shows that in Jordan the greater contribution to the overall inequality is due
                          to expenditure on non-food items (more than 80 percent both for JD-HV2 and
                          for JD-HV3), while in Lebanon the inequality in non-food expenditure shows a
                          much lower relative importance (65 percent for LB-VASyR data).

                          used to compare the welfare aggregates across the four data sets. Table 5.6

US$-PPP values. As a reference poverty line for the report we use US$159.7
PPP/capita/month (US$5.25 PPP/capita/day), which is the equivalent of JD 50/
capita/month (the cutoff point the UNHCR uses for targeting the cash assistance
program in Jordan). This line is lower than the national poverty line used in
Jordan (JD 78.3) and it is also lower than the equivalent line used in Lebanon
(LBP 271,763).1 However, this line is substantially higher than the international
poverty line per capita per day of US$1.25 PPP values.
   Table 5.7 compares the poverty rates (headcount, poverty gap, and severity of
poverty) across the four data sets. According to the analyzed data, we observe
that refugees in Jordan appear to be poorer than in Lebanon based on a JD 50
poverty line and that the JD-HV3 data show the highest poverty rate overall
(73.2 percent). Recall that the JD-HV2 had a distribution that was shifted to the
left compared to other distributions and that we expected poverty to be higher
for this data set. However, we also found that the CDFs crossed and that the
worse-off distribution was JD-HV3 if we considered the upper part of the distri-
bution. This is what we see here. The poverty line considered here is high, which
implies that we consider most of the expenditure distribution, resulting in upper

      parts of the distributions playing a role in determining poverty. If we had used a
      lower poverty line, JD-HV2 would have appeared as the poorest distribution.
      This is an important result which confirms the results of chapter 2 of this study,
      that poverty rates for refugees are very sensitive to the choice of poverty line.
         The poverty rates registered in Jordan, both in JD-HV2 and in JD-HV3, are
      higher than the ones estimated for Lebanon. The poverty gaps are also higher in
      Jordan as compared to Lebanon but this time the poverty gap for JD-HV2 is
      higher than for JD-HV3. The same is true for the severity of poverty. This indi-
      cates that, overall, poverty increased between the two rounds of the Jordan HV
      data but it declined among the poorest individuals. Looking at Lebanon, we
      observe that the poverty rates for the LB-VASyR data are always significantly
      higher than the poverty rates for the LB-Verif data. This is due to the different
      samples considered between the two surveys. The LB-Verif includes those refu-
      gees who appealed as they were excluded from the WFP food vouchers, and who
      are therefore expected to be better off on average.


      Poverty Profile
      Harmonized data
      We first create a profile of the poor based on the variables that we were able to
      harmonize across data sets, keeping in mind the differences reported in the note
      to table 5.3. Splitting the population of refugees in groups according to different
      characteristics of the case/household2 and of the PA/household head allows us to
      better understand similarities and differences in the poverty profiles of Syrian
      refugees across the different sources of data considered.
          We replicate the comparison distinguishing between individual poverty rates
      (table 5.8) and case/household poverty rates (table 5.9). Both tables clearly show
      that individual and case poverty rates increase as the case or household size
      (depending on the data set) increases and as the number of children increases,
      both in Jordan and in Lebanon. Focusing on some relevant housing features, we
      notice that poverty rates are much lower for individuals and cases that rent or
      own their house and also for those living in bigger houses; this phenomenon is
      analogous in Jordan and in Lebanon. Moreover, the cases living in a proper apart-
      ment or house are less poor than the ones living in makeshift homes or tents; this
      finding is similar in the two countries of destination.
          Other important housing characteristics, which can be considered useful for
      detecting the poorest cases or individuals, are constituted by the “access to a
      kitchen” and “having a functioning latrine.” Accessibility to these facilities
      strongly reduces poverty both in Jordan and in Lebanon. Having access to piped
      water, instead, represents an important signal for identifying the worst-off cases
      only in Jordan and not in Lebanon; in the latter country, the proportion of poor
      is similar between the group of cases having piped water and those that do not
      have piped water.
          The second panels of tables 5.8 and table 5.9 analyze the effect of some char-
      acteristics of the PA (or household head for the Lebanon data) on poverty rates.

In both countries the poverty rate is higher for cases with a female PA. Cases
whose PA is married are poorer than cases with a single PA; this holds true for
Jordan and Lebanon. Looking at the age of the PA, we note that there are slight
differences across the data sets. The poorest age group is the one whose PA is
between 35 and 49 years, according to all data sets except LB-VASyR. The
Jordan data sets are concordant in affirming that the poorest age group is 35–49
years old, followed by the youngest (0–18 and 19–34 years old), while the least
poor is the group of cases whose PA is older (50 years and older). Differently, in
Lebanon the second poorest group is the one with the older PA (50 years and
older), while the least poor are the cases with a young PA (19–34 years old).
Moreover, the LB-VASyR data show that the youngest PAs (0–18 years old) are
the poorest of the data set.3 Finally, if the PA has studied longer and hence is
more educated, the poverty rate is lower, which is consistent in the two
countries.
   Summing up, the poverty patterns are very similar across the four data sets
considered and, hence, between Jordan and Lebanon. Also, the findings described
are consistent between individual and case poverty rates.

Nonharmonized data
Next, we replicate the poverty comparative analysis using results from chapter 2
and the online appendixes A, B, and C. These results are evidently less compa-
rable but provide more information in terms of the range of variables that may
be considered useful for poverty and welfare analyses. We provide a comparative
poverty profile according to the characteristics of the case (table 5.10) and of the
PA (table 5.11). Note that reported statistics refer to individuals for the data sets
JD-HV2 and LB-VASyR and to cases for the data sets JD-HV3 and LB-Verif.
   Table 5.10 compares the effect of some characteristics of the PA on poverty
rates across the different data sets. In all groups of refugees (except JD-HV2) the
poverty rate is higher for cases whose PA is female; moreover, uniformly across
the data sets, poverty incidence is higher for the group of Muslim and for the
group of Arab refugees. Also, single PAs are less poor than married, divorced, or
widowed PAs, both in Jordan and in Lebanon. The poverty incidence decreases
with the age of the PA, with the education attained by the PA, and also with
high-skilled occupations of the PA consistently in the two countries and four data
sets. In conclusion, the poverty patterns are very similar across data sets and,
hence, within Jordan and Lebanon.
   According to the characteristics of the case (table 5.11) and looking at the
migration patterns, the different data sets show that the poorest refugees tend to
come from the governorates of Hama and Quneitra. In Jordan, the governorates
of Ajloun and Tafilah host the poorest refugees. In Lebanon, the governorates of
Bekaa and North Lebanon are those hosting the poorest refugees. There is full
consistency among the data sets also about the following findings: (i) refugees
entering informally are poorer than those crossing the border formally; (ii) pov-
erty rates increase as the case/household size increases and as the number of

      Predictors of Welfare and Poverty
      We now replicate the welfare and the poverty models discussed in chapter 2 of
      this report, with the aim of detecting the covariates that show similar effects on
      welfare and poverty both in Jordan and in Lebanon. In order to compare the four
      data sets we first run the models using only the covariates that were harmonized
      for this comparative chapter. Therefore, the models explained here do not

perfectly coincide with the ones described in the specific analysis of each of the
four data sets (chapter 2 and online appendixes A, B, and C). In a following step,
we compare the nonharmonized data using the information reported in each of
the online appendixes that focused on the individual data sets.

Harmonized data
Welfare predictors. We first focus on the welfare model. Table 5.12 and table 5.13
present the estimates for the individual welfare and the case welfare (that is, with
and without weights represented by the case size), respectively. Individual wel-
fare increases with the age of the PA, according to all data sets. A similar finding
is registered for the welfare of the case, with the only exception being the refu-
gees interviewed in JD-HV3, whose welfare is lower for the oldest PA (50 years
or older) than for the younger PA. Analogously across the countries, welfare is
higher if the PA is more educated and if the PA is male. Looking at the marital
status, only in Jordan there is a significant difference in welfare between married
and single PA. In Lebanon such difference is statistically not significant. As easily

166                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      predicted, welfare decreases as the case size increases and as the number of chil-
      dren increases. This finding is consistent across the data sets.
          Moving to the housing characteristics, all the data sets are concordant in
      affirming that cases renting or owning their house are better off than cases not
      paying for accommodation, and that cases living in apartments or proper houses
      show higher welfare than those living in tents or makeshift homes. Also, welfare
      increases as the area of the house (square meters per person) increases, according
      to all data sets except for the JD-HV3 data.
          Less consistent are the effects of other housing characteristics considered: in
      Jordan having a kitchen increases welfare only for refugees interviewed by
      JD-HV3, while no significant difference is registered in JD-HV2. An ambiguous
      effect emerges in Lebanon. Conflicts appear also for latrine and piped water:
      having a latrine improves welfare in JD-HV2 and in LB-Verif, while it reduces
      welfare in JD-HV3. Finally, using piped water reduces welfare where this vari-
      able is significant. This is a counterintuitive result perhaps explained by the col-
      linearity of this variable with others, such as having a kitchen.
          Poverty predictors. Table 5.14 and table 5.15 summarize the estimates of the
      poverty model for individuals and for cases, respectively. The findings emerging
      from these tables are in line with the welfare models results discussed above. In
      table 5.14, the individuals’ probability of being poor decreases with the age of
      the PA in all data sets. The probability of being poor is also lower if the PA is
      more educated and if the PA is male. Being married decreases the probability of
      poverty in all data sets when looking at the population probability; for cases, the
      probability remains significant only for the JD-HV2.
          Not surprisingly, the probability of being poor sharply increases both with the
      case size and with the number of children. This finding is consistent according to
      all data sets. Furthermore, all data sets are consistent in showing that cases renting
      or owning their house and cases living in apartments or proper houses are less
      likely to fall into poverty. Also, the probability of poverty decreases as the area of
      the house increases. Finally, having a latrine reduces the probability of being poor
      in almost all data sets, while it reduces welfare in the JD-HV3. Conflicting results
      emerge for having a kitchen: in Jordan having a kitchen decreases the individual
      probability of being poor only for refugees interviewed by JD-HV3 data, while
      it increases the probability in JD-HV2 and in LB-VASyR.

      Nonharmonized data
      In this last section, we compare the results of the welfare and poverty models
      presented in chapter 2 and in online appendixes A, B, and C.

      Jordan: JD-HV2 versus JD-HV3 data
      Welfare predictors. The JD-HV2 data are able to explain between 48 and 53 per-
      cent of expenditure per capita and this compares to values between 42 and 56
      percent for the JD-HV3 data. Hence, on average, these models have a good fit and
      are able to explain approximately half of the variance in expenditure per capita.

   The set of predictors is not identical but there are a number of factors that
perform similarly with the two data sets (we focus here on the full models with
PG and HV variables combined). In terms of the characteristics of the PA, results
are almost identical. A case with a married, highly educated, and older PA has
higher welfare on average according to both data sets.
   In terms of characteristics of the case, results are also very similar. Case size is
the most important predictor and the coefficients on this variable increase mono-
tonically and with a negative sign across the number of persons for both data sets
with no exceptions. The same can be said for the proportion of children. Cases
who entered the country formally predict higher welfare, while cases that
entered the country via the Tal Shibab border are those with the lowest pre-
dicted welfare. Having a kitchen or stove increases welfare, while crowding
reduces it in both data sets. Other variables such as paying rent and coping
mechanism and having ventilation were important in JD-HV2 data but not in
JD-HV3 data. Vice versa, other variables such as food consumption and chil-
dren's education were important in the JD-HV3 data but not in JD-HV2.
   Poverty predictors. In terms of the characteristics of the PA, the poverty predic-
tors largely mimic the welfare predictors but not for all variables. For example, a
married and highly educated PA predicts lower poverty according to both data
sets but older age predicts higher poverty, while in the welfare models it pre-
dicted higher welfare. In terms of characteristics of the case, variables that pro-
duce consistent results across the two Jordan data sets and across the welfare and
poverty models are case size, proportion of children, the Tal Shibab point of
entry, crowding (higher poverty), formal arrival, and paying rent (lower poverty).
The variables that are not common to both data sets are similar to those of the
welfare model.

Lebanon: LB-VASyR versus LB-Verif data
Welfare predictors. The welfare models utilizing the LB-VASyR and the LB-Verif
data are able to reliably explain between a third and half of the variance of per
capita expenditure, respectively. The LB-VASyR data would seem a better sam-
ple for the welfare estimations as compared to the LB-Verif sample, despite the
fact that the latter sample is much larger and relies on a similar questionnaire.
Evidently, the fact that the LB-VASyR is a random sample of refugees as opposed
to the LB-Verif data set, which is a self-selected sample, plays a role in improving
the explanatory capacity of the model.
   The percentage of dependents or percentage of children in a household has a
negative effect on per capita expenditure for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The
destination of refugees is a significant predictor for Syrian refugees in Lebanon
using both data sets. Higher levels of education (above secondary) enter signifi-
cantly into the model for both data sets and have a positive effect on welfare.
Household size, which shows a negative effect on welfare in both instances, is the
largest contributor to the explanatory power of the model for both data sets—
over 14 percent for LB-Verif data and 10 percent for LB-VASyR. The second
largest contribution to welfare of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is variables related
170                               The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      to housing conditions such as crowding or paying rent. Housing variables that can
      be used to predict welfare of refugees in Lebanon regardless of data source
      include variables on crowding and type of latrine, both of which have a negative
      effect on the welfare of refugees. In addition, luxury assets (such as a fridge and
      water heater) are predictors of increased wealth of refugees in Lebanon but have
      a different importance depending on the data source used.
         In addition to the common variables described above, certain variables predict
      the welfare of refugees in Lebanon in only one or the other data source.
      According to the LB-VASyR data, the following variables help predict welfare of
      refugees in Lebanon: (i) first arrival of refugee household in Lebanon; (ii) num-
      ber of children not attending school; (iii) limiting the portion size of meals as a
      coping strategy; (iv) cooking fuel available; and (v) household rents. On the other
      hand, some variables predict the welfare of refugees in Lebanon using LB-Verif
      but not LB-VASyR data, including: (i) single-headed households; (ii) type of
      occupancy (owned/furnished rental, unfurnished rental, assisted, squatting); (iii)
      number of household members working; (iv) amount of debt; and (v) food
      consumption.
         Poverty predictors. The poverty models using the LB-VASyR and LB-Verif data
      are similar to the welfare models in that they retain most of the variables
      included in the welfare model. The biggest contributor to the poverty model is
      household size, which has a similar contribution for the LB-VASyR (9.7 percent)
      and the LB-Verif data (11.5 percent). The second group of variables that contrib-
      utes to explaining whether a household is poor or non-poor are housing vari-
      ables.4 Both models, using LB-VASyR and LB-Verif data, include the crowding
      indicator, luxury assets, and types of latrines. We can therefore conclude that
      household size, destination of refugees, and living conditions, such as type of
      housing, crowding, and latrines, and luxury assets contribute to predicting pov-
      erty well.
         Two new variables entered the poverty model and predict whether a house-
      hold is poor using the LB-Verif data: gender of head of household and at least
      one disabled adult, neither of which is significant in the LB-VASyR model. The
      poverty model using the LB-VASyR data includes the origin of refugees, which
      was not significant in the welfare model using LB-VASyR data and not available
      in the LB-Verif data.

      Jordan versus Lebanon data
      There are clearly more similarities than differences in the two welfare and pov-
      erty modeling exercises in Jordan and Lebanon. The similarities relate to the fact
      that the emergency context is similar (urban, protracted), the affected popula-
      tion is similar (demographically, socioeconomically, and culturally), and the host
      countries are similar (middle income, urbanized). The differences can be attrib-
      uted to different data structures as already explained. The questionnaire and
      therefore the variables available for analysis are also different—that is, the
      LB-Verif data set has more information on income and employment. The unit of
      analysis is different: in Jordan, HV data were collected at the case level, while in
A Comparative Analysis across Countries and Data Sets                                    171


Lebanon we have multiple cases that make up a household. The capacity to
merge the household surveys (both in Lebanon and in Jordan) with the PG data
set is different: in Jordan it was easier to match PG data with survey data than in
Lebanon, due to the difference in the unit of observation. The PG data them-
selves are different. In Lebanon there are missing variables, such as border cross-
ing point, or data were collected differently; for example, in Lebanon level 1 or
basic data were collected before returning to households to collect level 2 data.
With regards to the ability to predict welfare, the analysis using the Jordan
JD-HV2 (JD-HV3) data set achieves 48 (42) percent predictive capacity with
PG only, and 53 (56) percent with additional indicators. The Lebanon LB-VASyR
(LB-Verif) data achieved 6 (30) percent using PG indicators and 47 (45) percent
using the larger data set and additional indicators.5 Finally, with regards to predic-
tive capacity and estimated leakage and under-coverage rates, the results are
almost identical.


Conclusion
This chapter made the most of available data on Syrian refugees in Jordan and
Lebanon to derive lessons on poverty and the predictors of poverty and welfare.
We compared results across the two countries, four data sets, harmonized and
nonharmonized data, and using weighted (individual level) and non-weighted
(case level) data. We kept in mind that absolute values of poverty are not strictly
comparable, as the samples and questionnaires considered are different.
   Comparing expenditure distributions, we found the LB-Verif data to show the
highest values across the whole distribution while among the three remaining
distributions (JD-HV2, JD-HV3, and LB-VASyR) there is no absolute domi-
nance along the entire distribution. For lower parts of the distribution, JD-HV2
data show the lowest welfare, while for upper parts of the distributions JD-HV3
data show the lowest welfare. Moreover, the CDF curves cross several times,
indicating that the ranking changes at each crossing point. We also found that the
ranking across data sets shown by the poverty gap is not necessarily the same as
the one shown by the poverty rate. This means that results on poverty are very
sensitive to the poverty line and to the depth of poverty, a finding that confirms
the lessons of chapter 2 of the study.
   Inequality is surprisingly high among refugees although we observed some
signs of decline between 2013 and 2014. The average level of inequality (Gini
coefficient) for all data sets considered is 0.39. These levels of inequality are high
when compared to the Syrian population before the crisis (0.32 in 2007), to host-
ing countries (Jordan = 0.34 in 2010 and Lebanon = 0.36 in 2005), and to other
countries in the region such as Egypt (0.32 in 2009). We would have expected
inequality to be low because refugees rely on a reduced set of assets and income
opportunities and they tend to be a self-selected group of poorer people as com-
pared to the Syrian pre-crisis population. These results are therefore surprising.
   Looking at the poverty rates (headcount, poverty gap, and severity of pov-
erty), we showed that poverty is high even if we use a poverty line that is lower
172                                The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: Evidence from Jordan and Lebanon


      than the one used by hosting countries. According to data analyzed, refugees in
      Jordan appear to be poorer than in Lebanon. The poverty rates registered both
      with JD-HV2 and with JD-HV3 data are higher than the ones estimated for
      Lebanon. The JD-HV3 data show the highest poverty rate overall (73.2 percent).
      The poverty gaps are also higher in Jordan as compared to Lebanon but the
      poverty gap for JD-HV2 is higher than for JD-HV3. The same is true for the
      severity of poverty. This indicates that, overall, poverty has increased between
      the two rounds of the Jordan HV data but it has declined among the poorest
      individuals. If we look at Lebanon, the poverty rates for the LB-VASyR data are
      always significantly higher than the poverty rates for the LB-Verif data. This is
      due to the different types of samples considered; the LB-Verif includes those
      refugees that appealed as they were excluded from the WFP food vouchers and
      are therefore expected to be better off on average.
         The poverty profile is similar across the four data sets considered and, hence,
      between Jordan and Lebanon. Also, the findings are consistent between individ-
      ual and case poverty rates. In particular, individual and case poverty rates increase
      as the case/household size increases and as the number of children increases,
      while they are much lower for cases that rent or own their house and also for
      those living in bigger houses. The cases living in a proper apartment or house are
      less poor than the ones living in makeshift homes or tents. In both countries of
      destination the poverty rate is higher for cases with a female PA. Cases whose PA
      is married are poorer than cases with single PAs, and if the PA is more educated,
      the poverty rate is lower.
         The welfare and poverty models find a set of core variables to be very consis-
      tent across countries and data sets in their capacity to predict welfare and pov-
      erty. Variables that almost invariably predict higher poverty and lower welfare
      are: (1) case or household size, (2) the number of children, (3) crowding, and
      (4) informal arrival in the country. Variables that almost invariably predict lower
      poverty and higher welfare are: (5) renting or owning the property, and (6) living
      in an apartment or house made of concrete. Having a kitchen or a proper latrine
      are also often found to be good predictors of increased welfare and reduced pov-
      erty. These are important findings, because the four data sets considered are very
      heterogeneous in terms of samples, questionnaires, data collection methods, and
      degree of representation of the underlying population of refugees. Such findings
      provide the UNHCR with a solid baseline to target the refugee population based
      on a rather restricted number of indicators and irrespective of how the samples,
      questionnaires, and data sets have been constructed.
         It is important to stress that the poverty profile is a univariate analysis while
      the welfare and poverty models are multivariate analyses. Results can be different
      between the two analyses. For example, we find married people to be poorer in
      the poverty profile but less poor in the poverty models. That is due to the fact
      that married people tend to live in larger households and have more children.
      Once we control for these factors, the effect of this variable on poverty changes.
      This is what makes the consistency of the results between the poverty profile and
      the poverty models the most valuable. For almost all harmonized indicators we
A Comparative Analysis across Countries and Data Sets                                  173


find similar results between the two analyses. This indicates that there is weak
correlation between the independent variables of the poverty model, an essential
feature of good econometric models.
   There are clearly more similarities than differences in the two welfare and
poverty modeling exercises in Jordan and Lebanon. Similarities may be attrib-
uted to the fact that the emergency context is similar (urban, a protracted crisis),
the affected population is similar although not identical (demographically, socio-
economically, culturally), and the host countries have similarities (middle
income, urbanized). The differences found in results can be attributed to differ-
ent samples and questionnaires administered. This means that there is scope for
improving and harmonizing the UNHCR’s data collection efforts across coun-
tries and also within countries. If this is done, the UNHCR will be in a very good
position to target refugees based on the restricted number of indicators shown
above and on a reduced set of data collection exercises, something that could
contain the cost of the existing refugees’ assistance programs significantly.

      Notes
      1. The values for the national poverty line in Lebanon should be treated with caution.
         The last official poverty line dates back to the 2004/2005 survey and it was deter-
         mined on a household level. Therefore, we had to take an average poverty line and
         update this line to 2013 using the CPI index published in the IMF World Economic
         Outlook database (April 2015). For Jordan, we used instead the official poverty line
         used in 2010 and updated this line to 2013 using the CPI published in the World Bank
         World Development Indicators database (March, 2015).
      2. The terms case and household as well as principal applicant and household head are
         used interchangeably. However, data for Jordan refer to case and principal applicant
         while data for Lebanon refer to household and household head.
      3. These differences could also stem from the fact that ages are taken from LB-VASyR
         and LB-Verif data in the case of Lebanon while PG data were used in the case of
         Jordan.
      4. It should be noted that certain variables were not available in the LB-Verif data, such
         as first arrival or number of children not attending school.
      5. Only one PG variable (destination of refugees) could be used in the PG model.
