ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The initial idea for this compendium came out of a collaboration between the Legal Vice
Presidency and the Education Global Practice at the World Bank on the role of law to end child
marriage.
The discussions took place within the context of a global study being conducted by the World Bank
and the International Center for Research on Women on the economic and social costs of child
marriage with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Children Investment
Fund Foundation, as well as additional support from the Global Partnership for Education under a
grant for work on out of school children.
Partial funding for the initial stages of this compendium was provided under those initiatives, with
subsequently the bulk of the work developed within the framework of the Global Forum on Law,
Justice and Development under the coordination of the Legal Vice Presidency. We envisage this
compendium as complementary to a series of short country briefs on selected legal and
institutional aspects of child marriage for a subset of countries listed in this compendium are being
made available separately.
We wish to thank the following organizations and inidividuals for their outstanding contribution,
assistance, and guidance on this project.

    COMPENDIUM OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON
                           CHILD MARRIAGE


The Compendium of International and National Legal Framework on Child Marriage (“the
Compendium”) provides a survey of the key international, regional and national legal instruments
as they relate to the right to marry with the full and free consent of the intenting spouses and to
the obligation for government to take legislative measures to abolish child marriage.
The Compendium consists of topical chapters with jump links to source documents, such as United
Nations conventions, regional treaties, national constitutions and legislations.
Jump links are in bold colored font and can be accessed by pressing CTRL and clicking on the link,

        Child marriage2, defined as a formal marriage or an informal union before age 183 is a
harmful reality for both boys and girls4 around the world5. Because of the long-term economic
development impacts (drop out of school, literacy issues, lack of job opportunities), but also public
health consequences (early and unwanted pregnancy, vulnerability to sexually transmitted
infections, obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation) and economic and social rights
challenges affecting children and women (full enjoyment of the right to health and education),
child marriage is a fundamental barrier to the achievement of international commitments for
gender equality6 with a significant economic development impact.
       The gender specificities of this issue7 have been well quantified these past years by UNFPA,
ICRW and UNICEF8. If present trends continue, 150 million girls will be married before their 18th
birthday over the next decade. That’s an average of 15 million girls each year. 9 The challenge for
the international community and for governments is therefore to provide the legal, technical
solutions and the concrete financial resources to address this harmful practice before the loss of
another generation of girls.
        Several promising developments have been recently made and demonstrated the
international, regional and national commitments to eradicate child marriage. On July 7 2015 the
United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously adopted a resolution co-sponsored by over 85
States to strengthen efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage. The
resolution is the first-ever substantive resolution on child marriage adopted by the Council10.

        The African Union appointed in October 2014, Dr Fatima Delladj-Sebaa as Special
Rapporteur on Child Marriage11 and announced on June 17 2015 that the African Union
members12 formally adopted a common position on ending child marriage in Africa. Under the
new agreement, the African Union urged its Member States to establish comprehensive action
plans to end child marriage, including establishing and enforcing laws which set the minimum age
for marriage at 1813. Following this effort, the Southern African Development Countries (SADC)
Parliamentary Forum announced that they have mobilized financial and technical resources to
develop a Model Law on Child Marriage and have already held of a two-day national follow-up
workshop on child marriage laws in Lusaka, Zambia in June 201514.

       The UN Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015 include eliminating
child marriage as a key target by 2030 for advancing gender equality.

       The implementation of a uniform minimum age is considered as a key component of a
multi-sectoral approach to prevent child marriage. This study will therefore focus on the national
review of laws stating a minimum age to marry on countries with high prevalence of child
marriage, for instance, in Africa (Mali, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia), in Asia (Bangladesh,
Pakistan), Latin America (Peru), OECD countries (Australia, Germany and United States), Middle-
East North Africa (Yemen, Saudi Arabia) and will analyze how these countries comply with their
international commitment and passed specific laws stating a minimum age to marry, but also
implemented them.

                                                       Working Definitions


For the purpose of this study, we will refer to this list as working definitions.


Child: refers to anyone under the age of 18, consistent with usage under international law.
Child marriage: refers to any marriage where one or both spouses are under the age of 18.
Full civil legal capacity: when a person, male or female, reaches the age of majority.
Gregorian years or calendar: is today's internationally accepted civil calendar and is also known
as the "Western calendar" or "Christian calendar". It was named after the man who first
introduced it in February 1582: Pope Gregory XIII. The calendar is strictly a solar calendar based
on a 365-day common year divided into 12 months of irregular lengths.
Lunar years or calendar: a calendar that is based on cycles of the lunar phases. Because there are
slightly more than twelve lunations in a solar year, the period of 12 lunar months is equivalent to
354.37 days. A common purely lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar or Hijri Qamari calendar.
Marriage: is used in its widest sense to cover a betrothal or union between two people, recognized
under civil law, religious law, or customary rites, and understood to be binding by the spouses
concerned, their families and the wider community, whether or not it has been formally registered
in law.
Marriageable age or Minimum age for marriage: the minimum age of marriage has been
prescribed by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as being 18 years of age.

1. GLOBAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK


1. 1 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948
Article 2: Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending
spouses.

Article 16: Men and women of full age without any limitations due to race, nationality and religion,
have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage
during marriage and at its dissolution15.



1.2 The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and
Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, 195616
Article 1: Each of the States Parties to this Convention shall take all practicable and necessary
legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and as soon as possible the complete
abolition or abandonment of the following institutions and practices, where they still exist and
whether or not they are covered by the definition of slavery contained in article 1 of the Slavery
Convention signed at Geneva on 25 September 1926.

Any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age of 18 years, is delivered
by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person, whether for reward
or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labor.



1.3 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966
Article 23: 1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to
protection by society and the State. 2. The right of men and women of marriageable age to marry
and to found a family shall be recognized. 3. No marriage shall be entered into without the free
and full consent of the intending spouses. 4. States Parties to the present Covenant shall take
appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during




15 While UDHR is not obligatory upon all states, it has long been treated as persuasive in international law and its provisions, including those that
touch on equal right for men and women, are treated as customary under international law. For discussion see Child Marriage and the Law,
UNICEF, Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series, 2008, pg. 2
16
   As mentioned previously, this document treats “child marriage” as including the term forced marriage. While the Slavery Convention is more
frequently used in the context of war and civil conflict, its definition of forced marriage is clear and informative. The Slavery Convention plays an
important role in the broader international legal framework around child marriage by addressing it in the humanitarian context, and for this
reason it is included in this review. See e.g. Child Marriage and the Law, UNICEF, Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series, 2008. For a general
discussion on the importance of highlighting forced marriage in a humanitarian context see generally “Marrying Too Young, End Child Marriage.”

protection of any children.17



Other Relevant Documents
General Comment 19: Article 23, paragraph 2, of the Covenant reaffirms the right of men and
women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family. Paragraph 3 of the same article
provides that no marriage shall be entered into without the free and full consent of the intending
spouses…The Covenant does not establish a specific marriageable age either for men or for
women, but that age should be such as to enable each of the intending spouses to give his or her
free and full personal consent in a form and under conditions prescribed by law. 18


1.4 International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1976
Article 10: 1. The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family,
which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and
while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children. Marriage must be entered
into with the free consent of the intending spouses.19

Other Relevant Documents
General Comment 16: Article 10 (1) of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize that
the widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, and that marriage
must be entered into with the free consent of the intending spouses… to ensure that men and
women have an equal right to choose if, whom and when to marry - in particular, the legal age of
marriage for men and women should be the same, and boys and girls should be protected equally
from practices that promote child marriage, marriage by proxy, or coercion; Gender based
violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including
economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality. States parties must take appropriate
measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due diligence to prevent,
investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors. 20




17 Similar to UDHR, while the ICCPR does not prohibit child marriage outright, its other obligations to ensure equal rights for both men and
women within and outside the family provide support to the widely held premise that early/child marriage effectively prevents the exercise of
equal rights for women and children. For additional discussion see Child Marriage and the Law, UNICEF, Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series,
2008, pg. 13.

19 Similar to discussions previously related to UDHR and ICCPR, the equal rights obligations under ICESCR support the general prohibition against
child marriage even though not explicitly states. See e.g. Child Marriage and the Law, UNICEF, Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series, 2008, pg.

1.5 Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979
Article 2 (f): CEDAW calls upon states parties to take all appropriate measures, including
legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations customs and practices which constitute
discrimination against women.

Article16 (1) (b): States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination
against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall
ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women.(b) The same right freely to choose a spouse and
to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent; 6: States Parties shall take all
appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and
exploitation of prostitution of women.

Article 16 (2): The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect, and all necessary
action, including legislation, shall be taken to specify a minimum age for marriage and to make
the registration of marriages in an official registry compulsory. 21



Other Relevant Documents
General Recommendation No. 19:
Traditional attitudes by which women are regarded as subordinate to men or as having
stereotyped roles perpetuate widespread practices involving violence or coercion, such as family
violence and abuse, forced marriage, dowry deaths, acid attacks and female circumcision. Such
prejudices and practices may justify gender-based violence as a form of protection or control of
women. The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive
them the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
While this comment addresses mainly actual or threatened violence the underlying consequences
of these forms of gender-based violence help to maintain women in subordinate roles and
contribute to the low level of political participation and to their lower level of education, skills and
work opportunities.22

General Recommendation No. 21
Article 16 (2) and the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child preclude States
parties from permitting or giving validity to a marriage between persons who have not attained
their majority. In the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, "a child means every
human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child,
majority is attained earlier". Notwithstanding this definition, and bearing in mind the provisions

[children] have attained full maturity and capacity to act…23 Some countries provide for different
ages for marriage for men and women…these provisions should be abolished. In other countries,
the betrothal of girls or undertakings by family members on their behalf is permitted. Such
measures contravene not only the Convention, but also a woman's right freely to choose her
partner. States parties should also require the registration of all marriages whether contracted
civilly or according to custom or religious law. The State can thereby ensure compliance with the
Convention and establish equality between partners, a minimum age for marriage, prohibition of
bigamy and polygamy and the protection of the rights of children.24

General Recommendation No. 24:
When reporting on measures taken to comply with article 12, States parties are urged to recognize
its interconnection with other articles in the Convention that have a bearing on women's health.
Those articles include article 5 (b)…article 10…article 11…article 14 (2) (b)… article 16 (1) (e)…[and]
[a]rticle 16 (2) [which] proscribes the betrothal and marriage of children, an important factor in

regard to numerous health-related situations, including those covered in articles 24 and 33 such
as…protection from harmful traditional practices, including early marriages…28
The Committee is concerned that early marriage and pregnancy are significant factors in health
problems related to sexual and reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS. Both the legal minimum
age and actual age of marriage, particularly for girls, are still very low in several States parties…
The Committee strongly recommends that States parties review and, where necessary, reform
their legislation and practice to increase the minimum age for marriage with and without parental
consent to 18 years, for both girls and boys. 29

In light of articles 3, 6, 12, 19 and 24 (3) of the Convention, States parties should take all effective
measures to eliminate all acts and activities which threaten the right to life of adolescents,
including honor killings…States parties should facilitate the establishment of multidisciplinary
information and advice centers regarding the harmful aspects of some traditional practices,
including early marriage and female genital mutilation.30

Article 2: Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 1 above, it shall not be necessary for one of the
parties to be present when the competent authority is satisfied that the circumstances are
exceptional and that the party has, before a competent authority and in such manner as may be
prescribed by law, expressed and not withdrawn consent.

Article 3: States Parties to the present Convention shall take legislative action to specify a
minimum age for marriage. No marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age,

1.8 UN Human Rights Council Resolution, Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate
child, early and forced marriage, July 2015
Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates, abuses and
impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights
violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls,
and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to promote and
protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and to prevent and
eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage.

Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains an impediment not only to the
economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of society
as a whole, and that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the meaningful
participation of girls in all decisions that affect them, and women’s full, equal and effective
participation at all levels of decision-making are a key factor in breaking the cycle of gender
inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical for, inter alia, sustainable
development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth.

provided by law. The future spouses must have the age of 18 to enter into marriage.

Article 14: The marriage of minors who have not reached the age of legal majority is subject to

3.1.9 Eritrea
Transitional Civil Code of Eritrea, 1991

Article 581: The marriageable age is 18. However, this does not apply if the man and woman have
both attained the full age of 16 years and the woman submits to the authority who will celebrate
the marriage a declaration made by a doctor stating that the woman is pregnant or has already
given birth to a child42.

Customary Laws of Eritrea
The customary laws of Eritrea do not specifically define the concept of “legal majority”. Under the
written customary laws, the legal majority is inferred from marriageable age.
For example, the Loggo Chewa Customary Code states fifteen for females and eighteen for males.
Most customary laws do not specifically state the minimum age for marriage and other
transactions. The unwritten customary laws determine civil majority according to physical
maturity, cultural ceremonies and participation in economic activities. The unwritten customary
laws supersede the written customary laws in practice43.

3.4.8 Libya
Before the 2011 revolution, Libya did not have a constitution and the country’s legal framework
was based on a series of laws and declarations, which include the 1977 Declaration of the
Authority of the People and the 1988 Great Green Charter of Human Rights in the Age of the
Masses. Following Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi’s coming to power in 1969, the civil and Shari’a
courts were merged and civil courts with jurisdiction over family matters were created 84.
However, in August 3, 2011 the National Transitional Council promulgated a Constitutional
Declaration.

According to the Article I of the Constitutional Declaration, “Islamic Shari’a shall be the main
source of legislation”85.

Law No. 10 of 1984 on Provisions Concerning Marriage, Divorce, and their consequences.

Article 6: For legal capacity to marry, parties must be of age and sound mind. Legal capacity to
marry shall be complete when the age of twenty is attained. The court shall have the right to
permit marriage before this age is reached where it determines some benefit or necessity and
after the agreement of the guardian. A person who marries in accordance with the two preceding
paragraphs shall be eligible to act in everything connected with marriage and its consequences.

Article 7: The guardian in marriage shall be a male agnate according to the order of inheritance.
It is stipulated that the guardian be of age and of sound mind. If two guardians are of equal
relationship then either may act as marriage guardian in the marriage provided they meet
required the conditions. If the nearest guardian is absent and the court sees that to wait for his
opinion would be detrimental with regard to the marriage the guardianship shall pass to the next
in the hierarchy. The court shall be guardian to a person who has no guardian.

Article 8: It shall not be permitted for a guardian to force a young man or woman to marry against
their will. Likewise, it shall not be permitted for a guardian to prevent his ward from marrying a
man whom she wishes as her husband. If there is a dispute between those acting as guardians in
the affairs of the engaged couple with regard to the marriage, the contract shall not be concluded
until a decision has been issued by the relevant court86.

New York Domestic Relations Law
§ 7. Voidable marriages

A marriage is void from the time its nullity is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction if either
party thereto:
1. Is under the age of legal consent, which is eighteen years, provided that such nonage shall not
of itself constitute an absolute right to the annulment of such marriage, but such annulment shall
be in the discretion of the court which shall take into consideration all the facts and circumstances
surrounding such marriage;
2. Is incapable of consenting to a marriage for want of understanding;
3. Is incapable of entering into the married state from physical cause;
4. Consent to such marriage by reason of force, duress or fraud;
5. Has been incurably mentally ill for a period of five years or more

§ 15. Duty of town and city clerks

2. If it appears from the affidavits and statements so taken, that the persons for whose marriage
the license in question is demanded are legally competent to marry, the said clerk shall issue such
license except in the following cases. If it shall appear upon an application that the applicant is
under eighteen years of age, before the town or city clerk shall issue a license, he shall require
documentary proof of age in the form of an original or certified copy of a birth record, a
certification of birth issued by the state department of health, a local registrar of vital statistics or
other public officer charged with similar duties by the laws of any other state, territory or country,
a baptismal record, passport, automobile driver's license, life insurance policy, employment
certificate, school record, immigration record, naturalization record or court record, showing the
date of birth of such minor. If the town or city clerk shall be in doubt as to whether an applicant
claiming to be over eighteen years of age is actually over eighteen years of age, he shall, before

issuing such license, require documentary proof as above defined. If it shall appear upon an
application of the applicants as provided in this section or upon information required by the clerk
that either party is at least sixteen years of age but under eighteen years of age, then the town or
city clerk before he shall issue a license shall require the written consent to the marriage from
both parents of the minor or minors or such as shall then be living, or if the parents of both are
dead, then the written consent of the guardian or guardians of such minor or minors. If one of the
parents has been missing and has not been seen or heard from for a period of one year preceding
the time of the application for the license, although diligent inquiry has been made to learn the
whereabouts of such parent, the town or city clerk may issue a license to such minor upon the
sworn statement and consent of the other parent. If the marriage of the parents of such minor
has been dissolved by decree of divorce or annulment, the consent of the parent to whom the
court which granted the decree has awarded the custody of such minor shall be sufficient. If there
is no parent or guardian of the minor or minors living to their knowledge then the town or city
clerk shall require the written consent to the marriage of the person under whose care or
government the minor or minors may be before a license shall be issued. If a parent of such minor
has been adjudicated an incompetent, the town or city clerk may issue a license to such minor
upon the production of a certified copy of such judgment so determining and upon the written
consent of the other parent. If there is no other parent whose consent is required by this section,
then and in such event, the town or city clerk shall require the written consent of the guardian of
such minor or of the person under whose care or government the minor may be before a license
shall be issued. The parents, guardians, or other persons whose consent it shall be necessary to
obtain and file with the town or city clerk before the license shall issue, shall personally appear
and acknowledge or execute the same before the town or city clerk, or some other officer
authorized to administer oaths and take acknowledgments provided that where such affidavit or
acknowledgment is made before an official other than an officer designated in section two
hundred ninety-eight of the real property law as authorized to take such affidavit or
acknowledgment if a conveyance of real property were being acknowledged or proved, or if a
certificate of authentication would be required by section three hundred ten of the real property
law to entitle the instrument to be recorded if it were a conveyance of real property, the consent
when filed must have attached thereto a certificate of authentication.

3. If it shall appear upon an application for a marriage license that either party is under the age of
sixteen years, the town or city clerk shall require, in addition to any consents provided for in this
section, the written approval and consent of a justice of the supreme court or of a judge of the
family court, having jurisdiction over the town or city in which the application is made, to be
attached to or endorsed upon the application, before the license is issued. The application for
such approval and consent shall be heard by the judge at chambers. All papers and records
pertaining to any such application shall be sealed by him and withheld from inspection, except by
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Before issuing any licenses herein provided for, the
town or city clerk shall be entitled to a fee of thirty dollars, which sum shall be paid by the
applicants before or at the time the license is issued. Any town or city clerk who shall issue a
license to marry any persons one or both of whom shall not be at the time of the marriage under
such license legally competent to marry without first requiring the parties to such marriage to

show that the parties authorized by said license to be married are legally competent to marry,

hundred dollars for each and every offense. On or before the fifteenth day of each month, each
town and city clerk, except in the city of New York, shall transmit to the state commissioner of
health twenty-two dollars and fifty cents of the amount received for each fee collected, which
shall be paid into the vital records management account as provided by section ninety-seven-cccc
of the state finance law. In any city the balance of all fees collected for the issuing of a marriage
license, or for solemnizing a marriage, so far as collected for services rendered by any officer or
employee of such city, shall be paid monthly into the city treasury and may by ordinance be
credited to any fund therein designated, and said ordinance, when duly enacted, shall have the
force of law in such city. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the clerk of any city
with the approval of the governing body of such city is hereby authorized to designate, in writing
filed in the city clerk's office, a deputy clerk, if any, and/or other city employees in such office to
receive applications for, examine applications, investigate and issue marriage licenses in the
absence or inability of the clerk of said city to act, and said deputy and/or employees so designated
are hereby vested with all the powers and duties of said city clerk relative thereto. Such deputy
and/or employees shall perform said duties without additional compensation.

§ 15-a. Marriages of minors under fourteen years of age

Any marriage in which either party is under the age of fourteen years is hereby prohibited. Any
town or city clerk who shall knowingly issue a marriage license to any persons, one or both of
whom shall be at the time of their contemplated marriage actually under the age of fourteen
years, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be fined in the sum of one
hundred dollars.

(2) By a person, agency, or institution having legal custody or serving as a guardian of the underage
party.

Such written consent shall not be required for an emancipated minor if a certificate of
emancipation issued pursuant to Article 35 of Chapter 7B of the General Statutes or a certified
copy of a final decree or certificate of emancipation from this or any other jurisdiction is filed with
the register of deeds.

(b) Persons over 14 years of age and under 16 years of age may marry as provided in G.S. 51-2.1.

(b1) It shall be unlawful for any person under 14 years of age to marry.

(c) When a license to marry is procured by any person under 18 years of age by fraud or
misrepresentation, a parent of the underage party, a person, agency, or institution having legal
custody or serving as a guardian of the underage party, or a guardian ad litem appointed to
represent the underage party pursuant to G.S. 51-2.1(b) is a proper party to bring an action to
annul the marriage.



§ 51-2.1. Marriage of certain underage parties

(a) If an unmarried female who is more than 14 years of age, but less than 16 years of age, is
pregnant or has given birth to a child and the unmarried female and the putative father of the
child, either born or unborn, agree to marry, or if an unmarried male who is more than 14 years
of age, but less than 16 years of age, is the putative father of a child, either born or unborn, and
the unmarried male and the mother of the child agree to marry, the register of deeds is authorized
to issue to the parties a license to marry; and it shall be lawful for them to marry in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter, only after a certified copy of an order issued by a district court
authorizing the marriage is filed with the register of deeds. A district court judge may issue an
order authorizing a marriage under this section only upon finding as fact and concluding as a
matter of law that the underage party is capable of assuming the responsibilities of marriage and
the marriage will serve the best interest of the underage party. In determining whether the
marriage will serve the best interest of an underage party, the district court shall consider the
following:

(1) The opinion of the parents of the underage party as to whether the marriage serves the best
interest of the underage party.

(2) The opinion of any person, agency, or institution having legal custody or serving as a guardian
of the underage party as to whether the marriage serves the best interest of the underage party.

(3) The opinion of the guardian ad litem appointed to represent the best interest of the underage
party pursuant to G.S. 51-2.1(b) as to whether the marriage serves the best interest of the
underage party.

(4) The relationship between the underage party and the parents of the underage party, as well
as the relationship between the underage party and any person having legal custody or serving as
a guardian of the underage party.

(5) Any evidence that it would find useful in making its determination.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the marriage will not serve the best interest of the
underage party when all living parents of the underage party oppose the marriage. The fact that
the female is pregnant, or has given birth to a child, alone does not establish that the best interest
of the underage party will be served by the marriage.

(b) An underage party seeking an order granting judicial authorization to marry pursuant to this
section shall file a civil action in the district court requesting judicial authorization to marry. The
clerk shall collect court costs from the underage party in the amount set forth in G.S. 7A-305 for
civil actions in district court. Upon the filing of the complaint, summons shall be issued in
accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, and the underage party shall be appointed a guardian ad litem
in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 17. The guardian ad litem appointed shall be
an attorney and shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. The underage
party shall serve a copy of the summons and complaint, in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, on
the father of the underage party; the mother of the underage party; and any person, agency, or
institution having legal custody or serving as a guardian of the underage party. The underage party
also shall serve a copy of the complaint, either in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, or G.S. 1A-1,
Rule 5, on the guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to this section. A party responding to the
underage party's complaint shall serve his response within 30 days after service of the summons
and complaint upon that person. The underage party may participate in the proceedings before
the court on his or her own behalf. At the hearing conducted pursuant to this section, the court
shall consider evidence, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and shall make written
findings of fact and conclusions of law.

(c) Any party to a proceeding under this section may be represented by counsel, but no party is
entitled to appointed counsel, except as provided in this section.

(d) The guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall represent the
best interest of the underage party in all proceedings under this section and also has standing to
institute an action under G.S. 51-2(c). The appointment shall terminate when the last judicial
ruling rendering the authorization granted or denied is entered. Payment of the guardian ad litem
shall be governed by G.S. 7A-451(f). The guardian ad litem shall make an investigation to
determine the facts, the needs of the underage party, the available resources within the family
and community to meet those needs, the impact of the marriage on the underage party, and the
ability of the underage party to assume the responsibilities of marriage; facilitate, when
appropriate, the settlement of disputed issues; offer evidence and examine witnesses at the
hearing; and protect and promote the best interest of the underage party. In fulfilling the guardian
ad litem's duties, the guardian ad litem shall assess and consider the emotional development,
maturity, intellect, and understanding of the underage party. The guardian ad litem has the

to prevent the guardian ad litem and the court from obtaining such information. The
confidentiality of the information or reports shall be respected by the guardian ad litem, and no
disclosure of any information or reports shall be made to anyone except by order of the court or
unless otherwise provided by law.

(e) If the last judicial ruling in this proceeding denies the underage party judicial authorization to
marry, the underage party shall not seek the authorization of any court again under this section
until after one year from the date of the entry of the last judicial ruling rendering the authorization
denied.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of evidence in civil cases shall apply to
proceedings under this section. All hearings pursuant to this section shall be recorded by

(e) If a person under the age of consent is married in violation of this section, the marriage is not
void for this reason, and such marriage is valid until it is actually annulled.

(f) A marriage by an underage person without a valid consent as required by this section, though
voidable at the time it is entered into, may be ratified and become completely valid and binding
when the underage party reaches the age of consent. Validation of a marriage by ratification is
