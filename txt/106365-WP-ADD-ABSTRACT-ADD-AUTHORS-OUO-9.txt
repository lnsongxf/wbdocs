Executive Summary
Climate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group
(WBG). Current weather extremes already affect millions of people, putting
food and water security at risk, and threatening agricultural supply chains
and many coastal cities. Without further action to reduce extreme poverty,
provide access to basic services, and strengthen resilience, climate impacts
could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030.
   Climate change presents enormous challenges and opportunities for develop-
ment, making it essential that climate and development be tackled in an inte-
grated way. The world needs to feed nine billion people by 2050, provide affordable
energy access to all, and extend housing and services to two billion new urban
dwellers—and to do so while minimizing emissions and boosting resilience.
   Recent global developments favor bold climate action by the WBG. At the
most recent Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, 140 World Bank
client countries committed to implement their Nationally Determined
­
Contributions (NDCs) as part of an agreement to limit global warming to less
than 2°C by 2100, and make best efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. At the
same time, public and private actors have renewed their global commitments
to increase investments and research and development, boost carbon pricing,
and end wasteful energy subsidies.
   This Climate Change Action Plan (for short: “the Action Plan”) demon-
strates how the WBG intends to meet these challenges and opportunities, by
scaling up climate action, integrating climate change across its operations, and
working more closely with others. The Action Plan is driven by client demand,
focused on activities that support the WBG’s core mission, and builds on the
WBG’s comparative advantage.
   Countries start from different points and have different emission levels,
and therefore need differentiated actions and support. These differences
translate into different climate commitments in the NDCs, and into different
needs in terms of support that the WBG can and will provide.
   To get impact at scale, the Action Plan is focused on helping to shape
national investment plans and policies and leveraging the private sector.
Financing needs for resilient, low-carbon growth are much larger than avail-
able public resources, and WBG resources are small relative to these needs.
Policy and institutional support for national investment plans and for facili-
tating private sector initiatives will be critical to having impact at scale.
   The Action Plan reconfirms the WBG’s commitment to increase the cli-
mate-related share of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response
to client demand, with total financing (including leveraged co-financing) of
potentially $29 billion per year by 2020. Meeting these targets is conditional
on sustained aggregate WBG lending volumes, access to concessional finance,
and client demand.
   The Action Plan is underpinned by five strategic shifts for the WBG’s c  ­ limate
work: (i) Implementation: the WBG focus will accelerate support for countries


World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                      1
and companies to implement the plans they have developed. (ii) Convergence:
the WBG climate and development agendas will be fully integrated into strat-
egies and operations, and global- and country-level action will be aligned.
(iii)  Maximizing impact: the WBG will increase its focus on impact at scale,
including shaping national investment policies and programs and mobilizing
private finance. (iv) Resilience: the WBG climate portfolio will be rebalanced—
putting a greater focus on adaptation and resilience. (v)  Transformation:
achieving global climate commitments will require a shift from business as
usual. The Action Plan will focus on facilitating transformational impacts.
   The Action Plan is based on comprehensive joint preparation between
the  Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA), Regions, Global
Practices (GPs) and other CCSAs, International Finance Corporation (IFC),
and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Regions and GPs,
as well as the IFC, have prepared a background analysis and developed comple-
mentary and detailed contributions. The Action Plan also includes the IFC
Climate Change Implementation Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan.
   WBG activities under the Climate Change Action Plan are organized along
four top-level priorities: (i) support transformational policies and institu-
tions, (ii) leverage resources, (iii) scale up climate action, and (iv) align inter-
nal processes and work with others.



Support Transformational Policies and
Institutions
The WBG will support countries in translating their NDCs into climate
policies and investment plans into actions, and in mainstreaming climate
­
considerations into policies and budgets, through advisory services, public
expenditure reviews, and development policy operations. The objective is to
help client countries strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity, and
deliver affordable and efficient services (especially energy) in a low-carbon
manner and in a way that is consistent with their NDCs and global climate
commitments. The WBG will work to ensure that the vulnerable are protected
and will help build country capacity in this regard.
  The WBG will scale up country-level support and global advocacy work to
“get prices right”, by helping clients to reform fossil fuel subsidies, put a price
on carbon, deepen market-based instruments, and reform other distorting
subsidies. Carbon pricing work will be extended to widen, deepen, and con-
nect markets.



Leverage Resources
The IFC will crowd in private sector finance by significantly scaling up its own
investments—from $2.3 billion to about $3.5 billion in five years. By 2020, it
will mobilize at least $13 billion per year in external private sector invest-
ments through its operations.

2	                                  World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
   To “green” the financial sector, the WBG will work with regulators, create
green banking champions, provide climate credit lines, and promote contin-
ued growth and development of the green bond market.
   The WBG will scale up financial leverage in operations for resilience and
mitigation through improving the preparation, structuring, and aggregation
of projects; de-risking private investments; and scaling up support for a cli-
mate-smart focus in project preparation facilities. Cross-WBG “deal teams”
will focus on delivering bankable/investable projects, including through the
use of blended concessional finance, for high-impact sectors—such as energy
infrastructure, rooftop solar, distributed energy service companies, and resil-
ient urban infrastructure.
   The International Development Association (IDA) has a strong record of
supporting climate change activities, and the WBG has a strong record of
using blended non-IDA concessional finance, but existing funding is limited.
There is an ongoing need for concessional finance, IDA and non-IDA, to
accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, build climate
resilience, and meet climate targets. The WBG is counting on a strong IDA18
replenishment and significant non-IDA concessional financial support to
meet the targets in this Action Plan. In the coming months, the WBG will
develop an integrated approach to the mobilization and management of these
different sources of funding in the context of the Forward Look initiative.
   The WBG will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of, and helping coun-
tries gain access to, concessional climate finance. Concessional climate finance
will be concentrated on the incremental cost of climate action, to redirect
investment flows and maximize impact. The WBG will work to ensure that
policy options, institutional practices, and reforms are deployed to minimize
the required level of concessional finance.


Scale Up Climate Action
By 2020, the WBG will have significantly scaled up its activities with climate
co-benefits in multiple sectors and increased its impact in countries through
direct investments, advisory services, and the shaping of new and innovative
solutions. In particular, the WBG will deepen and scale up its action in six
high-impact areas, with indicative targets that represent current expectations
of future demand. Achievement of these targets will be dependent as always
on client demand; these targets are not commitments and will be adjusted
over time. The six areas are described in the following.

Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
The World Bank will use multiple instruments to de-risk renewable energy
investments, with a cumulative target of adding 20 gigawatts (GW) in renew-
able energy generation over five years, that is, a doubling of current World
Bank additions. The World Bank will “green” grids with the aim to enable the
addition of 10 GW of variable renewable energy over the same period, and
ensure that all energy investments are adapted to climate change. The IFC and

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                  3
MIGA will support grid-connected clean energy by focusing on large hydro-
power, wind, and solar, continuing to open new markets with “first-of ” invest-
ments, and helping industrial and commercial clients expand the use of
low-carbon captive power. The WBG will increase its share of energy effi-
ciency operations and aim to invest $1 billion to promote energy efficiency
and resilient building in urban areas. The World Bank will aim to mobilize
$25 billion in commercial funding for clean energy over the next five years.

Sustainable Mobility
The WBG will help countries develop sustainable mobility alternatives and
implement transport adaptation options. It will increase the share of its trans-
port portfolio that contributes to climate mitigation and resilience. It will pur-
sue urban mobility and low-carbon, multimodal transport operations in all
regions and aim for $2 billion in lending for adaptation in the transport sector
over fiscal year (FY) 16–FY20 (four times the level in the previous five-year
period), with a strong focus on enhancing the resilience of the road portfolio.
The WBG will also focus on improving the competitiveness and fuel efficiency
of the trucking sectors, promote green freight, and lead a global coalition to
develop a framework for sustainable mobility.

Sustainable and Resilient Cities
The WBG will further integrate climate into urban planning, by developing
tools and knowledge products through the Global Platform for Sustainable
Cities, and aim to roll these out in at least 30 cities by 2020. It will develop
and  aims to pilot in 15 cities by 2020 a city-based resilience approach that
integrates infrastructure development, land use planning, disaster risk man-
agement, institutions/governance, social components, and infrastructure
investment. It will incorporate principles of integrated urban water manage-
ment in its urban operations. By 2020, transit-oriented development solution
packages will be piloted in at least five cities. The IFC and MIGA will increase
investments in municipal transport.

Climate-Smart Land Use, Water, and Food Security
Climate-smart agriculture profiles and investment plans will be developed by
2020 for at least 40 countries, and climate-smart agriculture programs will be
delivered at scale, with a focus on hybrid seeds and carbon capture practices,
high-efficiency/low-energy-use irrigation programs, livestock productivity,
energy solutions for agribusiness, and mainstreaming of risk management.
Under the Forest Action Plan, the WBG aims to support Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Conservation of Forest Stocks,
Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks
(REDD+) strategies in more than 50 countries, and develop/implement in
10  countries a large-scale, multisector program promoting “forest-smart”
development and mobilizing International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD)/IDA/REDD+ financing. The WBG will work with its

4	                                 World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
partners to improve the effectiveness of the various forest climate funds. The
WBG will develop a series of area-based operations in climate-sensitive loca-
tions, using ecosystem-based adaptation, land restoration, integrated water
management, and biodiversity conservation, to maximize the development
benefits and the use of carbon sinks. It will implement large-scale national and
transboundary programs to promote water efficiency across sectors, and
improved water management. Analytical work will be further developed on
the energy-water-food nexus.

Green Competitiveness
By 2020, the WBG aims to have assisted 20 countries in enhancing their
capacity to innovate in climate sectors and increase industrial competitive-
ness in response to climate change, including through greening global value
chains and trade practices, developing eco-industrial zones, and introducing
best practices for standards and labeling. The IFC will intensify its work with
entrepreneurs, through incubators and private equity investments, to increase
impact and grow the market in climate-smart innovation.

Leaving No One Behind
By 2020, the WBG will aim to (i) help bring access to high-quality hydrome-
teorological data and early warning systems to another 100 million people in
15 developing countries; (ii) help bring adaptive social protection to an addi-
tional 50 million people; and (iii) provide five more countries coverage with
integrated sovereign disaster risk financing instruments, including insurance,
risk pools, and contingent finance. The Small Island States Resilience Initiative
will build capacity, better use the existing fragmented funds, and mobilize
increased financing for small island states. The WBG will produce a flag-
ship  report on climate change and migration/conflict. The WBG will also
strengthen action on climate and health, increase its capacity to respond to
the 32 IBRD and 40 IDA-eligible countries that have included health in their
NDCs, and integrate climate considerations within its support for universal
health care.



Align Internal Processes and Work with Others
With selected partners, the WBG will create, share, pilot, and implement new
and innovative solution packages that answer client countries’ demands,
especially those linked to their NDCs, and continue contributing to the global
debate on climate and development. The WBG’s internal capacity to respond
will also increase. WBG country strategies will take into account climate goals
and opportunities, and climate risks. The World Bank will screen all projects
for climate risks and account for the social cost of carbon emissions in project
evaluations; the WBG will move toward accounting for climate and carbon
risks in its operations. In addition, the impact of WBG operations on green-
house gas (GHG) emissions will be calculated and reported.

   The WBG will work with others to benefit from what they do best, and
ensure synergies across actors active in the field. The WBG will continue
to  strengthen alignment and cooperation with multilateral development
banks (MDBs) and bilaterals on strategies and work programs; work on
mainstreaming principles and reporting with MDBs and the international
­
development finance agencies; strengthen collaboration with leading think
tanks, research groups, nongovernmental organizations, and business alli-
ance groups, including on coordinated analytical work and country support;
and build on work already started to increase collaboration with the
International Monetary Fund on fossil fuel subsidies, carbon pricing, and the
fiscal implications of climate change, especially for small island states.
   Global advocacy will be stepped up on selected issues where the WBG has
an established voice—carbon pricing, mainstreaming climate action, and
protecting the poor and vulnerable—with a focus on “how” to deliver rather
than “why.”
   The WBG will align internal processes, metrics, and incentives to support
the implementation of the Action Plan. Systematic Country Diagnostics and
Country Partnership Frameworks will consider the risks and opportunities
created by climate change and countries’ climate priorities. Risk screening
will be extended to IBRD operations in early 2017, after a review of existing
tools and the lessons drawn from application to IDA countries, and will inte-
grate gender considerations into the screening tools. The IFC will start screen-
ing some sectors after having tested and validated its climate impact risk
screening tool; this is expected to be done by September 2016 and to lay the
basis for the IFC’s path forward. The WBG will continue to roll out GHG
accounting and account for carbon emissions, and resulting risk, in its project
evaluations. The World Bank will account for the social cost of carbon emis-
sions in its project evaluations, and the IFC will evaluate such an approach
later this year.
   Over the next 18 months, the WBG will continue to develop and main-
stream metrics and indicators to measure the outcomes of WBG operations,
and move monitoring and evaluation from inputs to outcomes, to incentivize
a greater focus on leverage.
   Easily accessible, consolidated “one-stop-shop” data will be made available
to all staff on climate impacts, NDCs, climate finance, analytic tools, and
methodologies. Learning modules on climate will be expanded and main-
streamed into the World Bank’s core curriculum, and support to the commu-
nity of practice of climate change practitioners across the World Bank will be
strengthened.
   The WBG organization is now aligned to deliver on this Action Plan. All
WBG units have put in place structures to mainstream climate change into
their activities and operations. The IFC has developed a Climate Business
Network that includes one climate anchor from each industry department and
from each region, advisory, and operational unit. The Climate Change CCSA
works with all WBG units to provide targeted, cross-cutting climate support.

1. Context and Rationale
Climate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group
(WBG): to end extreme poverty and increase shared prosperity in a sustain-
able way. Current weather extremes already affect millions of people, putting
food and water security at risk, and threatening agricultural supply chains
and many coastal cities. As shown in the WBG’s Turn Down the Heat reports,1
climate change will make these events more frequent and extreme. WBG bor-
rowers are exposed to greater climate risks than high-income countries are.
Climate impacts on food security are especially strong, for example, in Africa.
Lower-income countries suffer disproportionally from natural disasters,
with  almost half of disaster casualties occurring in low-income countries,
and  ­economic losses sometimes exceeding 10 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in small, vulnerable economies. Specific locations, such as
­
small islands or large cities located in deltas and low-lying coastal zones
(especially in Africa and Asia), are at very high risk. As the WBG’s Shock
Waves report2 demonstrates, without further action to reduce extreme
­
poverty, provide access to basic services, strengthen resilience, and increase
adaptive capacity, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million
people into poverty by 2030.
­
   Sustaining long-term poverty reduction means that it is essential to meet
global climate objectives to keep average temperature increases below 2°C,
which in turn requires rapid global action to reach zero net emissions by the
second half of the century. There are limits to what adaptation and resilience
actions can achieve, and avoiding the long-term threat to prosperity requires
stabilization of the climate. Maintaining the increase in global temperature
below 2°C would prevent many of the worst impacts of climate change from
occurring. Doing so requires urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and
increase carbon sinks. Delaying action would significantly increase the cost
of  keeping warming below 2°C—according to Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, delaying action until 2030 would increase
total mitigation costs by 50 percent.3
   Climate change presents enormous challenges, and opportunities, for
development, making it essential that climate and development be tackled in
an integrated way. The world needs to feed nine billion people by 2050 while
reducing emissions, increasing carbon sinks, and ensuring climate-resilient
food security. It needs to provide affordable energy access to the 1.1 billion
people worldwide who still live without electricity, while keeping emissions to
a minimum and managing a transition away from fossil fuels. New research
suggests that more than four billion people already experience severe water
scarcity during some part of the year, and climate change will increase
water stress in many regions. Countries will have to provide access to mobility
using resilient and low-carbon transport modes and systems. Cities will have
to welcome two billion new urban dwellers with livable, energy-efficient
dwellings, low-carbon transport, good jobs, and appropriate access to ser-
vices, while reducing vulnerability to climate shocks. Populations need to be

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                 7
protected against natural disasters and climate-related diseases, even as
hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity over time. And
­
$90 trillion in low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure investment will be
needed by 2030—mostly in developing countries. Building more resilient
infrastructure is essential to adapting to climate change, but is also likely to
increase upfront costs, although it will be cost-effective in the longer run.
   There are also opportunities to exploit the co-benefits from climate-smart
development. Climate-smart urban planning and public transit can improve
the livability of cities; renewable energy and mini grids can provide new
opportunities to improve energy access; energy efficiency can reduce energy
costs and improve fuel security; and climate-smart agriculture and efficient
food supply chains lead to higher agricultural productivity, less waste, and
better food security.
   Recent global developments favor bold climate action from the WBG. At
COP21 in Paris, the world came together and agreed to limit global warming
to less than 2°C by 2100, and make best efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. As
part of the Paris process, 140 World Bank client countries committed to
implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which out-
line their actions on climate action. In 2015, the world also committed to the
Sustainable Development Goals, the Financing for Development Agreements,
and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In parallel, many
firms made strong commitments before or during COP21: 114 companies
announced emission reduction targets; 36 multinationals committed to use
100 percent renewable energy; and more than 1,000 companies are setting up
carbon pricing systems.
   The negotiators have done their job. The priority in the next few years is to
focus on accelerated implementation. COP22 in Morocco will be an opportu-
nity to take stock of the implementation of the first year of these commit-
ments. All these commitments show increasing global demand for climate
change action and a mandate and opportunity for the WBG to support coun-
tries and companies in meeting these objectives, in partnership with others.
At the same time, good policies and technological advances are making more
rapid advances possible. Renewable energy prices continue to fall, there is a
renewed global commitment to research and d     ­ evelopment, and the use of big
data is enabling cheaper and faster risk ­ assessments. And there is growing
momentum behind carbon pricing and  ending wasteful energy subsidies.
There are large opportunities for WBG interventions.

2. Climate Change Action
Plan: Structure and Drivers
This Climate Change Action Plan demonstrates how the WBG intends to
meet these challenges and opportunities. It lays out concrete actions to help
countries and companies address current and future climate risks and oppor-
tunities, and describes how the WBG will build on its comparative advantage,
scale up climate action, integrate climate change across its operations, and
better work with others.
    WBG climate action will be driven by client demand, focusing on those
activities that support the WBG’s core mission and build on its comparative
advantage. The actions proposed focus on supporting client demand, recogniz-
ing that client needs differ. The Action Plan focuses on supporting the WBG’s
core mission of eliminating extreme poverty and enhancing shared prosperity
in a sustainable way. And it builds on the WBG’s comparative advantage to
tackle complex, multisector problems in an integrated way, combining all of its
instruments (funding, knowledge, and convening power), its local presence
but global reach and experience, its deep technical expertise and multisector
                                                           private sectors.
integration, and its ability to work across the public and ­
    To get impact at scale, a key focus of the Action Plan is to help to shape
policies and national investment plans and leverage the private sector.
Financing needs for resilient, low-carbon growth are much larger than avail-
able public resources, and WBG resources are small relative to these needs.
The investment needs embedded in the NDCs amount to more than $1 tril-
lion per year over the next 15 years, while WBG annual commitments are
around $60 billion per annum. Although WBG funding will remain impor-
tant, policy and institutional support for national investment plans and stra-
tegic use of private sector finance to open markets and facilitate increased
actions from external investors will be critical to having impact at scale.
    To achieve its global climate commitments, the WBG will support transfor-
mational changes in multiple domains. While action on the ground will be
driven by demand in countries, the Action Plan will accelerate action by driv-
ing  innovative solutions shaped by WBG global experience in several high-­
priority areas.
    To enable this change, WBG activities under the Climate Change Action
Plan are organized along four top-level priorities and four objectives for 2020
(see table 2.1).
    The Action Plan is underpinned by five strategic shifts for the WBG’s
­climate work:
••   Implementation. With Paris behind us, the WBG will shift its focus toward
     supporting countries, companies, and teams to accelerate implementa-
     tion, giving more attention to “how” to get results on the ground than on
     advocacy as to “why” change is needed.
••   Convergence. The WBG climate and development agendas (including
     subcomponents like gender, health, and others) will be fully integrated

      increase its focus on the total resources mobilized and catalyzed, rather
      than only focus on its own account lending, and adjust internal processes
      and incentives accordingly.
••    Resilience. The WBG climate portfolio will be rebalanced with a greater
      focus on adaptation and resilience, taking into account the contribution
      of resilience to poverty alleviation and the contribution of development
      and poverty reduction to resilience.
••    Transformation. Achieving global climate commitments and protecting
      the world against the negative impacts of climate change will require a
      shift from business as usual in multiple domains. The Action Plan will
      focus on facilitating these transformational impacts.

10	                                      World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
   The Action Plan is based on comprehensive joint preparation by the Climate
Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA), Regions, Global Practices
(GPs) and other CCSAs, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Such preparation ensures
ownership: each Region and GP, as well as the IFC, has prepared background
analyses (see the appendix). The preparation also includes the IFC Climate
Change Implementation Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan.
   The Action Plan has been designed through an iterative process. Agreed
actions are a combination of bottom-up proposals from different units and
a top-down push for strategic coherence and ambition. The process of devel-
opment of the Action Plan deepened unit-level understanding of options and
led to increased ambition. And the Action Plan promoted IFC-MIGA-World
Bank and cross-sector cooperation in the design of high-impact actions
(for  example, leverage of private capital) and in the definition of regional
priorities.



A Demand-Driven Plan
Countries start from different points and have different emission levels, are
exposed to different impacts, and therefore need customized actions and sup-
port (figure 2.1 and 2.2). Low-income countries currently have very low levels
of emissions per capita; they are not expected to implement the same actions
as richer countries, although they would benefit from avoiding carbon-­
intensive lock-ins and a future of high emissions. These differences translate
into different climate commitments in the NDCs, and different needs in terms
of support that the WBG can and will provide.
   Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has immense needs for adaptation, food secu-
rity, resilience, and energy access. Most NDCs in Africa prioritize adaptation.
Current WBG climate funding up to FY16 focuses on mitigation, but the
WBG’s Africa Climate Business Plan aims to raise $16 billion for adaptation
investments by 2020, including strengthening the resilience of natural, physi-
cal, and human capital, powering resilience, which will focus on improving
energy access via renewable energy, and enabling resilience with support
for  hydrometeorological services  and improved tools and capacity for
climate-resilient investment planning. The IFC will invest in large-scale
­
renewable energy, green buildings, and off-grid electricity, and will also be
looking at developing agricultural adaptation opportunities, which will
require new business models and technical assistance.
   The East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region contributes a third of carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions. The region also includes some of the areas that are most vul-
nerable to climate impacts (for example, small islands). Generation capacity is
expected to double by 2030 and, despite a decline in the share of coal, genera-
tion from coal is projected to increase by 455 gigawatts (GW) under a business
as usual scenario. Forests and landscapes are a key element of the climate chal-
lenge in the region and a major focus of climate policies. Current WBG opera-
tions are well aligned with the NDCs. A significant level of deliveries is expected

in FY16, with an expected share of investment with climate co-benefits near
50 percent. The IFC will expand its climate business in urban infrastructure
and renewable energy, with an emerging focus on South-South business. The
IFC will also build its climate-smart agriculture business in key markets.
   Europe and Central Asia (ECA) has countries with high energy intensity,
large forest resources, and differentiated vulnerability depending on subregions.
The NDCs focus on mitigation, but several also mention adaptation. Current
climate action in ECA aims to address energy intensity, green growth, sustain-
able forestry, sustainable cities, climate resilience, and support for clients’ NDCs.
There are opportunities to scale up climate funding, especially by tackling high
energy intensity, implementing integrated multisector planning, and fostering
cross-country knowledge exchange to support long-term action on climate
change at the national level. There are private sector opportunities in renewable
energy, sustainable cities, and sustainable energy finance.
   Latin America and the Caribbean (LCR) is vulnerable to natural disasters
and a shifting energy matrix that risks raising emissions through increased reli-
ance on fossil fuels, but is an innovator on climate policies (for example, green
growth strategies and carbon tax on fossil fuels in Mexico, and sustainable for-
est management in Brazil). The region has developed ambitious NDCs with
many unconditional pledges, although some action is conditioned on the avail-
ability of climate finance. The current WBG climate portfolio already targets
climate, mostly mitigation and disaster risk management (DRM), with increas-
ing private sector opportunities in urban infrastructure and agribusiness.
   The Middle East and North Africa (MNA) region represents 7 percent of
global emissions, but has high per capita emissions in oil-producing coun-
tries, and half of the world’s energy subsidies. Extreme vulnerability to cli-
mate change is linked to water availability and agriculture, sea level rise, and
heat waves. The NDCs are often less ambitious than the reforms already
underway in the energy sector, which can offer large mitigation co-benefits.
The WBG is ramping up its climate co-benefits in MNA from 13 to 29 percent,
primarily via mitigation in energy, finance and markets, and transport
(93  percent) in FY16–FY17. There is large potential to grow WBG climate
co-benefits in MNA in agriculture, cities, and water.
   The South Asia region (SAR) is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise, floods,
landslides, and agriculture—and rural areas have low access to clean and
modern energy services. Between FY11 and FY15, 29 percent of the regional
portfolio included climate co-benefits. Transformative action on climate
change requires partnership with countries to mobilize additional capital for
mitigation and adaptation action. The NDCs suggest large demand for fund-
ing for adaptation and mitigation, with private sector opportunities in urban
infrastructure, and wind and solar, and potential for sustainable agriculture.
   Some regions are preparing bottom-up regional climate business plans, based
on known demands and needs. The Africa Climate Business Plan was launched
at COP21 in December 2015; other regions are undertaking a similar process,
with identification of current demands and needs at the country level. A sum-
mary of priorities and key actions per region is included in the appendix. In
parallel, the GPs, IFC, and MIGA are working on new solutions to offer our

client countries and private sector actors, with an FY20 time horizon and based
on global knowledge and lessons learned. These solutions will be tailored to
country contexts and offered through country-level engagement.


Building on WBG Comparative Advantage
The WBG is uniquely positioned to bring the global climate agenda into
the  country-level development agenda, and align climate objectives with
development. The WBG will focus on combining its knowledge, finance,
and convening power in areas of comparative advantage, as identified by the
Forward Look Initiative and summarized in figure 2.3.
••     Country AND global. As a leading provider of globally informed knowl-
       edge and solutions, and with a strong country presence, the WBG can
       develop, pilot, share, and support the implementation of innovative,
       climate-smart development options and policies, integrating country-­
       ­
       level solutions and global experience and advocacy.
••     Public AND private. As a Group, the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are
       uniquely positioned to help develop and implement the public-private
       collaborations that are required to accelerate innovation and leverage
       private capital and resources for climate change.
       ­
••     Single AND multisector. As an organization that has engagements with all
       ministries and sectors, the WBG develops and implements the complex
       cross-sector and integrated solutions that the climate change challenge
       calls for.


Building on WBG Experience
The main agencies of the WBG have deployed increasing balance sheet
resources and dedicated climate funding to catalyze many projects with
significant climate co-benefits.1 Over the past five fiscal years, the WBG has
­
committed an average of $10.3 billion a year of its own resources, or around
21 percent2 of commitments, to help developing countries and emerging
economies mitigate the effects and adapt to the challenges of climate change.
More specifically, in that period, more than $50 billion has been committed
by the WBG through more than 900 projects with climate-related activities,

                                  climate and 73 percent on mitigating the impact of climate change. The IFC’s
                                  core climate business nearly doubled between FY11 and FY15, and 27 percent

                                     Climate co-benefits are generated in multiple sectors. Mitigation activities
                                  have included investments in renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, and
                                  hydropower), the promotion of energy efficiency, and changes to urban
                                  transportation and railways. Adaptation activities have included projects
                                  supporting coastal and flood protection, irrigation and drainage systems,
                                  protection for forests and landscapes, and the development of resilient crop
                                  systems. Beyond investment funding, the WBG provides policy and techni-
                                  cal advice, including on project design. Although technical support to cli-
                                  ent  countries on climate change may be small in financial terms, it can
                                  deliver major impacts for low-emission and climate-resilient development.

                                 Meeting WBG Commitments
                                 The Action Plan reconfirms the WBG’s commitment made at the 2015 Annual
                                 Meetings in Lima, Peru, to increase the climate-related share of its portfolio
                                 from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand, with total

financing (including leveraged co-financing) of potentially $29 billion per
year by 2020. Meeting these targets is conditional on sustained aggregate
WBG lending volumes, access to concessional finance, and client demand.
   Based on estimates from the GPs, IFC, and MIGA, climate co-benefits
could represent 28 percent of total lending by FY20 in a high scenario, and
25 percent in a low scenario. The GPs, Regions, IFC, and MIGA have identi-
fied and assessed areas of business growth, based on known and expected
demand, under high and low scenarios (figure 2.5). The Action Plan works
toward increasing the probability that the high scenario will materialize by
(i) supporting demand growth with analytical work and country engagement;
(ii) developing innovative solutions based on global experience that will create
their own demand (for example, new approaches for resilience, and business
models for scaling up renewable energy); (iii) better leveraging concessional
climate finance to increase demand and generate more climate co-benefits
with WBG resources; and (iv) building new climate business models and mar-
kets in key strategic areas where commercial capital needs assistance.

   Meeting these targets is conditional on sustained aggregate WBG lending
volumes, sustained access to concessional finance, and sustained client demand.
The WBG’s commitment in Lima noted that this is “in response to demand”
and “with support of its members.” The analysis presented in this Action
Plan  assumes (i) constant lending volume for the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (at FY15 levels); (ii) constant vol-
ume for the International Development Association 18 (IDA18) (compared
with IDA17); (iii) growth in the IFC’s own account consistent with the IFC’s
strategy and business outlook FY17–FY19 (and then a continued 4 percent per
year growth to FY20); and (iv) a 10 percent annual growth rate in MIGA’s
­
issuance of new guarantees (consistent with MIGA’s Strategic Directions
FY15–FY17 paper, extrapolated to FY20). Should aggregate lending be lower,
then the level of climate co-benefits will be lower than targeted, because of the
lower overall lending and the probability that the share of climate co-benefits
will be closer to the lower end of the projected range, in the face of competition
for scarce resources.
   Sustained access to concessional climate finance, blended with WBG
resources and private finance, will also be critical to meeting these objectives. In
addition, this will require that the implicit client demand for c ­ limate solutions
be translated into firm demand, in the face of competing demands for non-­
climate poverty reducing activities. The largest risk in this regard would arise if
economic conditions were to remain weak or worsen in several large borrow-
ers, and this resulted in a relative increase in demand for policy reforms, budget
support operations, and a higher proportion of social protection lending.
   Many actions proposed in the Action Plan will contribute to increasing the
share of climate co-benefits in WBG operations. These actions are presented
in the following sections, with indicative targets that represent current expec-
tations regarding future demand. These targets are not commitments and
they will be adjusted over time. Increasing climate co-benefits does not nec-
essarily crowd out other sector investments. The focus on climate co-benefits
tracks the amount of WBG lending that is tagged for climate benefits.
Operations so tagged also deliver development benefits in mobility, energy
access and security, clean air, agricultural production, etc. Thus, they do not
crowd out other investments. However, an increase in climate co-benefits
does mean that the relative share of operations with climate benefits will
increase, and the share of operations that do not have climate benefits will as
a result decline.

    sions or increasing sinks) or to adaptation (by reducing the vulnerability of
    human or natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate variabil-
    ity-related risks, including by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity). For
    this analysis, the WBG uses a methodology for tracking climate co-benefits that is

    consistent across multilateral development banks. For all these analyses, the WBG
    uses the term climate co-benefits. Under the Paris agreement, the United Nations
    Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be supporting fur-
    ther work on what counts as climate finance under the UNFCCC agreements.
    The numbers reported in this paper are related to but may or may not be the same
    as what is counted for UNFCCC purposes.
	2	 The three-year rolling average (expressed as a percentage) has been used to
    assess the share of finance with climate-co-benefits in any given fiscal year. This
    rolling average is based on the average of the given fiscal year and the rolling
    averages of the preceding two years. Similarly, the FY11–FY15 average number
    is calculated by taking the average of the available three-year rolling averages for
    that period.

               Transformational Policies
               and Institutions
               To increase resilience and achieve climate commitments, deep economic
               transformations will be necessary, enabled by the policy and investment envi-
               ronment and institutions. The WBG will support countries in strengthening
               their sector-specific and national development planning processes, policies,
               and expenditure and fiscal frameworks, and in building institutional capacity
               to enable these transformations (see Box 3.1 for examples). These actions
               will aim to improve policies and public and private investments. To enhance

Bringing Climate into Investment Plans in the Philippines

The government is scaling up climate financing, building on the recommendations of the Climate
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review. The World Bank, with support from the Australian
government, is providing technical assistance to the Philippines government to implement these
reforms. So far, 53 national government agencies have prioritized and tagged their budget propos-
als for climate change spending using common guidelines and typology.

Inclusive Green Growth DPLs and the Integrated Disaster Risk Management and
Resilience Program for Results in Morocco

The Second Inclusive Green Growth Development Policy Loan (DPL) is focused on policies
aimed at preserving the environment and protecting the livelihoods of the most vulnerable citi-
zens, while developing new, climate-friendly job opportunities. In particular, it contributes to
higher incomes and improved livelihoods in rural areas, where a substantial part of Morocco’s
poor and vulnerable live. The Program for Results for Integrated Disaster Risk Management and
Resilience supports the development of a “national resilience fund” and aims at establishing a
more systematic process within the Government of Morocco to cover risk management activities
implemented by central government line ministries (horizontal integration) and local govern-
ments (vertical integration).

Partnership for Market Readiness Support to Design iNDCs

Country-specific analysis builds on modeling and analytical work undertaken as part of coun-
tries’ intended Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) formulation process. The Partnership
for Market Readiness provides critical technical input to this formulation and helps establish

analytical work is conducted in Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Kazakhstan, and Peru.

impact, the WBG will work to build coalitions of partners to support this
work in a coordinated way.



Support Countries to Transform Climate
Commitments and Priorities into Actions
The WBG will support countries to translate their NDCs into climate actions,
and to mainstream climate considerations into policies and budgets. The
NDCs are a new and welcome instrument. However, their quality and spec-
ificity vary considerably across countries. Building on the analysis already
completed of all the NDCs, and requests from several countries for specific
support, the WBG will expand its support, on demand, to more countries to
translate their NDCs into specific targets, prioritized policy interventions,
targeted investment plans, and financing plans. To provide further support
for implementation, the WBG will, building on experience in a few coun-
tries to date (see Box 3.1 for examples), support client countries in integrat-
ing their NDC plans and broader climate considerations into their national
planning and budgeting processes. Over time, the WBG will also support,
on demand, the design of future NDCs to enable a progressive increase in
ambition.
   The exact extent of demand for support on mainstreaming NDCs is uncer-
tain. This will be a priority for the WBG, but the speed will be determined
over the coming years. Several partner organizations are looking to support
countries in this area. The WBG will work to form coalitions to avoid dupli-
cation and focus on its comparative advantage. In this regard, the WBG has
strong connections with ministries of finance and planning, strong public
finance skills, and the ability to bring a multisector and strong analytical per-
spective and global experience. However, there is a strong role for other part-
ners as well, and the WBG will work closely with others in this area.
   The WBG will intensify its efforts to support low-carbon development,
including with support to reforms of the energy sector (for example, through
development policy financing or the Program for Results), to help client
countries deliver affordable and efficient services (energy, mobility, etc.) in a
low-carbon manner and in a way that is consistent with their NDCs and
global climate commitments. This work will rely on country engagement and
analytical work to identify lower-carbon options and pathways, and subse-
quent policy and investment needs, with a focus on countries where a large
increase in energy consumption is expected in the next decades.
   The WBG will support resilient development through advisory services,
public expenditure reviews, and development policy operations, with a strong
focus on ensuring that the vulnerable are protected. The WBG will expand
the use of development policy operations to support policy and institutional
reforms to strengthen resilience. Based on the Shock Waves report1, poverty
impact analysis at the country level will be used to inform climate action,
consider distributional impacts, and design ongoing analytical work. Gender
considerations will be built into climate risk and policy analysis and support.

               To complement the policy and advisory support, the WBG will, in collabora-
               tion with others, support building institutions and capacity for ­climate-resilient
               investment planning and help countries build resilient and low-carbon alter-
               natives into sector and project decisions.



               Get Prices Right
               A deep reduction in carbon emissions requires changes in public and private
               investments, and price signals are an efficient and powerful instrument to redi-
               rect investments toward lower-emissions projects and technologies. To accel-
               erate progress and facilitate climate action, the WBG will scale up country-level
               support and global advocacy to “get prices right” by reducing damaging fossil
               fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon, and deepening ­ market-based instru-
               ments, and reforming other distorting subsidies. WBG workstreams within
               this space will be strengthened, including through stronger coordination of
               instruments and approaches. The resulting changes in the relative prices of
               renewable versus fossil fuel energy sources, when accompanied by other policy
               choices and concessional finance, could have a major impact on future energy
               mixes, ensuring that future capacity growth has a lower carbon content.
                 In the past five years, the WBG has assisted many governments in assessing
               and reforming their energy sectors and subsidies (box 3.2), and will continue
               to do so. Direct fossil fuel subsidies were estimated at $493 billion in 2014,
               exceeding 1 percent of GDP in 31 countries. When properly implemented,

The Jordan First Programmatic Energy and Water Sector Reforms Development Policy Loan
($250 million) improves financial viability and increases efficiency gains in the energy and water
sectors in Jordan. World Bank development policy financing supports the country’s efforts to
diversify its fuel supply for power generation and shift power generation from heavy fuel oil and
diesel toward cleaner options, through scaling up the development of renewable energy resources
and gas-fired generation, increasing energy efficiency in the energy and water sectors, and opti-
mizing the allocation of water resources in an environment of extreme water scarcity.

Ukraine

With support from the World Bank’s Energy, Poverty, Social Protection, Social Development,
Macro, and Communications teams, the Ukrainian government announced significant increases
in gas (470 percent) and heating (260 percent) tariffs for households as of April 1, 2015. The
government simplified social assistance mechanisms on February 28, 2015. The government
­
approved a Gas Sector Reform Implementation Plan on March 25, 2015; energy tariff increases
and strengthening of social assistance mechanisms are an essential part of the plan. Media cover-
age of the reform improved, thanks to specific media training sessions.

subsidy reforms can generate large benefits in terms of economic perfor-
mance and poverty reduction, fiscal savings, and climate co-benefits. The
WBG will continue to support fossil fuel subsidy reform on demand in prior-
ity countries (work is currently underway in 20 countries), integrating fiscal,
social, political, and climate considerations. The current low fuel prices pro-
vide an opportunity to reduce these subsidies, but sustainable mechanisms
will need to be put in place to keep these prices from rising again when fuel
prices increase.
   Carbon pricing work will be extended to widen, deepen, and connect mar-
kets, with a focus on implementation at the country level. Carbon pricing is
increasingly being used to incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions (see box 3.3). And an increasing number of private actors are sup-
porting the introduction and use of carbon pricing. However, further efforts
are needed to accelerate the increasing coverage of emissions (currently only
15 percent of GHG covered) and ensure the success and efficacy of pricing
schemes, including but not limited to their effective price (85 percent of trades
cost less than $10/ton). The WBG will work with partners in the coming
months to agree on targets for a significant increase, by 2020, in the global
share of GHG emissions covered by carbon prices, and a material increase in
the effective carbon price in many of those markets. Much of this work will be
supported through the convening, knowledge sharing, and analytical work of
the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), where the goal would be to
increase the number of CPLC partner countries to cover more than 75 per-
cent of global GHG emissions by 2018 (up from the current 30 percent), and
to have actively supported country-level dialogues in 15 countries by end-
2017 and in 30 countries by 2020. Support will be continued for country
­
programs through the Partnership for Market Readiness and extending the
work on Networked Carbon Markets. The WBG will continue its influential
annual flagship “State and Trends of Carbon Pricing” report. The Heads
of  State Panel on Carbon Pricing will be supported to expand its work at
the  global political level. Results-based financing mechanisms, which put

4. Priority II: Leverage
Resources
Delivering on climate ambitions will require significant increases in invest-
ments in resilient and low-carbon infrastructure, in the context of a preexist-
ing financing gap. Renewable energy—even when it is cost-effective—requires
higher upfront investment; efficient and highly productive cities rely on
public transit and resilient water and sanitation infrastructure that are highly
­
capital-intensive; flood management infrastructure implies large investments;
and energy-efficient and disaster-resistant buildings are more expensive to
build, although the operating savings make up for more than the investment
costs. As a result, meeting the development and climate challenges will require
a significant increase in investment, and thus in financing, going beyond
what  public resources can provide. Increasing private capital flows toward
developing countries—and toward infrastructure in these countries—is an
imperative, making it critical to leveraging public resources.
    The WBG already achieves significant leverage of its resources. First,
it  leverages domestic public resources. Second, it mobilizes private capital
through the IFC. And third, the WBG catalyzes public and private, domestic
and international resources through, for instance, programmatic interven-
tions to remove barriers, the opening of new markets with “first-of ” invest-
ments, and piloting of new instruments or technologies.
    The IFC systematically mobilizes private sector capital through syndicated
loans, asset management companies, public-private partnerships, and IFC
initiatives (“core mobilization”). The IFC’s climate scorecard includes core
mobilized capital, creating an internal incentive to bring in external investors.
The IFC brings in additional co-financing by typically financing no more than
25 to 35 percent of the total project cost. Since 2009, the IFC has mobilized
$4.7 billion in core mobilization from private sector sources, and catalyzed
an additional $30 billion in co-finance, for total climate-related private co-
financing of $34.7 billion. These figures represent a 1:3 leverage ratio to the
IFC’s own account. (Including public sector co-finance, this ratio is 1:4.)
    Opportunities for further leverage of private capital will grow, if the
right conditions can be met. In 2014, a coalition accounting for more than
$24 trillion in assets committed to invest in the low-carbon economy; and a
year later, a group of 15 investors with $2.5 trillion in assets under manage-
ment committed to scale up financing for energy efficiency. However, there
are also risks and challenges related to private capital mobilization, including
the weak operating environment in some countries, low energy prices in
others, and the recent slowdown in economic growth.
­


Catalyze Private Capital
The IFC’s Climate Implementation Plan includes a significant scale-up of IFC
own account investments with climate co-benefits, which will also increase

24	                                World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
the volume of mobilized and catalyzed private capital. The IFC plans to grow
its commitment with climate co-benefits to 28 percent, that is, to $3.5 billion
by 2020, from the current level of $2.3 billion—a 50 percent increase in five
years. The IFC’s biggest impact is not its own account financing, but its ability
to bring in external capital for co-investment in climate sectors. The WBG
pledged to mobilize $13 billion in external private sector capital annually by
FY20. To achieve this private sector co-financing, the IFC will need to increase
its private sector leverage ratio from 1:3 to almost 1:4. To do so, the IFC will
create products that attract larger institutional sources of capital through
aggregation and securitization, create de-risking vehicles that use blended
finance, and increase its climate-related public-private partnerships.
   The WBG will help to “green” the financial sector through a coordinated
and integrated approach across banking, pensions, and capital markets to
implement the changes needed globally and nationally. Resilient and effec-
tive financial sectors will need to address the risk of climate change for the
financial sector, as well as the impact of the financial system on the climate
through allocation of resources that could be misdirected, for example,
because of fossil fuel subsidies and the absence of carbon pricing. The WBG
will expand financing for green investments by working with regulators on
the enabling environment; demonstrating the business case and creating
green financial champions; using programmatic interventions to remove
barriers to financial sector growth and use; promoting the adoption of
appropriate environment and social performance standards by pension
funds and banks; providing climate credit lines directly to private sector
banks; and working with banks and investors/pension funds to identify and
build the pipeline in climate sectors, as well as to measure and track their
climate investments.
   This work includes providing technical advice to banks and pension funds,
and integrating green elements into the development of bond markets. The
WBG will provide climate finance policy guidance for regulators, including
through the IFC-managed platform of the Sustainable Banking Network. The
WBG will gather data on whether climate risk threatens the stability of the
financial sector (globally but first in poor countries sensitive to climate risk),
and develop a performance framework to assess the level of greening of the
whole financial system and its contribution to climate change in terms of effi-
cacy, efficiency, resilience, and transparency. By 2020, the WBG aims to have
five country programs that can integrate green elements into banking, capital
markets, and pension funds.
   The WBG will promote continued growth and development of the green
bond market, at the corporate, financial institution, and municipal levels. The
WBG has already played a significant role in developing a robust, liquid green
bond market, reaching $41.8 billion in 2015. The IBRD has issued more than
$8 billion in green bonds and the IFC has issued about $4.3 billion. This work
will continue. To go further, the WBG will develop and deploy asset-backed,
project, and other new classes of green bond issuances, and continue existing
work in two or three countries, to implement green elements in ongoing bond
market development programs.

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                   25
   Well-designed strategic investment funds (SIFs), with the government as
anchor investor, could act as powerful catalysts to crowd in domestic and
international institutional investors in large, climate-resilient infrastructure
projects, by sharing and mitigating the risk of private investors. By 2020, the
WBG plans to work with SIFs in 34 markets, to make them greener and
­
support them in crowding in equity and debt financing from domestic and
international institutional investors.
   The WBG will also scale up financial leverage in World Bank, IFC,
and MIGA operations for resilience and mitigation by (i) improving the prep-
aration, structuring, and aggregation of projects, and (ii) helping rebalance
risk-reward profiles or de-risking private investments, for example, through
blended finance instruments (such as senior/mezzanine loans, equity, quasi-­
equity, and guarantee products), asset-backed securities, collateralized loan
obligations, or renewables performance insurance. As one example, the objec-
tive is to mobilize $25 billion in commercial funds for clean energy between
FY16 and FY20, including funds to support up to 20 GW of renewable energy
generation.
   The WBG will scale up support for project preparation facilities, such as
the  Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) and the Africa Climate Resilient
Investment Facility, so that they support the creation of resilient or low-­
carbon projects, and ensure that projects are developed following best prac-
tices in terms of resilience and climate change adaptation. For instance, the
GIF will encourage its technical partners to include shadow carbon pricing
analysis for all projects, where relevant. It will also monitor and report on the
portfolio share that delivers climate co-benefits. The GIF’s effectiveness and
efficiency in supporting climate-smart projects, among others, will be evalu-
ated as part of the facility assessments. And the GIF will pursue operational
collaboration with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and follow the same prin-
ciples and approach in its design of the Downstream Finance Window. The
World Bank, African Union Commission, and United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa have teamed up to develop the Africa Climate Resilient
Investment Facility to support the integration of climate change into infra-
structure planning and design by developing guidelines, providing training,
delivering on-demand advisory services, making data and knowledge tools
more easily accessible, and ultimately helping attract funding from sources of
development and climate finance.
   The WBG will also leverage expertise in a coordinated way across the WBG
to tackle high-opportunity sectors. It will create “deal teams” to work with
countries to deliver transactions at scale by generating a robust pipeline of
bankable/investable projects from early stage to financial closure. For selected
high-impact opportunities, blended concessional finance may be needed to
demonstrate viability and attract private capital. Early-stage ideas include the
following:
••    Energy infrastructure. The idea is to improve infrastructure deal flow and
      financing by operationalizing the work of the Sustainable Energy for All
      (SE4All) Finance Committee. By 2020, the WBG aims at working in six

26	                                World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
     countries, including four IDA countries, to help bundle projects and
     attract private investors. In FY17, an Infrastructure Management System
     Delivery Manual will be available to support all teams.
••   Rooftop solar. The photovoltaic (PV) solar industry has experienced tre-
     mendous growth in recent years, driven largely by declining costs and a
     growing interest in emission-free power. Rooftop installations for com-
     mercial, industrial, and residential customers make up a significant vol-
     ume of total solar capacity, but growth is often held back because financing
     is unavailable. Creating the conditions for the flow of institutional capital
     into these smaller systems would have a major impact on scaling the
     deployment of rooftop solar. The goal is to close two systematic transac-
     tions on rooftop solar in two countries by 2020.
••   Distributed energy service companies (DESCOs). DESCOs provide assets
     at below cost to customers who pre-pay for energy services. DESCOs
     have benefited from innovative approaches to establish and monetize cli-
     ent relationships, increased mobile phone penetration, and the falling
     cost of PV. However, the model requires large sums of working capital
     and many DESCOs are struggling to finance rapid annual growth. A joint
     IFC/World Bank team will explore how the WBG can accelerate the
     growth of distributed solar in SSA. By 2020, the objective is to close two
     transactions in two countries and crowd in private capital through suc-
     cessful securitization. By 2020, the team expects the number of deployed
     solar home systems in Nigeria to have increased by 50,000 and the n     ­ umber
     in SSA by 150,000.
••   Resilient urban infrastructure. The ability of cities to finance urban infra-
     structure depends on their: (i) budgets and creditworthiness, (ii) ability
     to exploit existing assets to finance new ones, (iii) ability to access regional
     or national government funding streams, and (iv) access to capital mar-
     kets and private finance. The existing financing gap highlights the chal-
     lenge to connect the necessary private capital to governments. A WBG
     “transaction team” would act as brokers, engaging a global network of
     partners to leverage public/private funding solutions. By 2018, the objec-
     tive is to close three transactions in more than one country, and by 2020,
     to close six transactions in two or more countries.


Optimize the Use of Concessional Finance
IDA has had a strong record of supporting climate change activities. Sustained
investment in good development outcomes is an important part of building
the resilience of poor communities to climate change. Under IDA17, the
WBG is contributing to mainstreaming climate and disaster risk in IDA
countries’ strategies, policies, plans, and investments, and screening all IDA
projects for climate change and disaster risks (and where risks are identified,
incorporating resilience into project design). It is expected that climate change
will continue as an important theme in IDA18, the focus of which is under
discussion with the IDA deputies.

  The WBG has a strong record of using non-IDA concessional finance
to support other resources used for mitigating the impact of climate change
(see box 4.1), but existing funding is limited. The Climate Investment Funds
(CIFs) supported $9.8 billion of IBRD, IDA, and IFC resources with their
own  $4.1 billion from 2010 to 2015. Across the multilateral development
banks (MDBs), including the WBG, $8.3 billion from the CIFs is on track to

  Concentrated Solar Power in Morocco

  The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, the government agency established to realize the coun-
  try’s solar ambitions, used a $43 million World Bank–Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant to
  test the viability of solar thermal technology at Ain Beni Mathar, in the northeast of the country,
  and encourage its replication nationwide. This laid the groundwork to scale up and secure the
  more than $3 billion needed for the Noor-Ouarzazate complex from the World Bank, the Climate
  Investment Funds’ (CIFs’) Clean Technology Fund, the African Development Bank, and European
  financing institutions. The approach accelerated cost reduction and the commercial adoption of
  large-scale, low greenhouse gas–emitting generation technologies while testing the viability of
  solar thermal technology to encourage its replication in Morocco and elsewhere.

  The China-GEF-World Bank Urban Transport Partnership Program (CUTPP)

  The program supports development of a national approach to sustainable urban transport, with
  activities in 14 cities. Approved in 2008, the CUTPP’s $21 million GEF grant has leveraged more
  than $500 million of investment, including approximately $200 million in World Bank funds. The
  project has stimulated collaboration among national ministries, including the National
  Development and Reform Commission, which plays a key role in urban transport.

  Increasing Tajikistan’s Resilience
  Tajikistan is considered the country most vulnerable to climate change in Europe and Central
  Asia. It is leveraging $60.7 million from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (from CIFs),
  with more than $80 million from development partners for climate-proofing water management
  and hydroelectric infrastructure, improving institutional capacities for integrating climate resil-
  ience into national development and investment planning, and supporting land management
  measures to enhance rural livelihoods, the latter of which also includes financing from a GEF
  grant ($5.4 million) and the International Development Association (IDA). Tajikistan’s strategic
  program for climate resilience has become a model for the region, with Central Asian countries
  engaged in the preparation of the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Program for the Aral Sea
  Basin, a platform for increased regional cooperation on climate action.

in Jamaica, the first renewable independent power producer developed by the private sector in the
country. Blended finance was needed to provide a debt package on terms that enable the project
to achieve commercial viability at the proposed tariff. The project is expected to demonstrate the
bankability of utility-scale wind farms in Jamaica and reduce early entrant costs, particularly on
regulatory aspects and legal documentation, for future private sector developers.

Geothermal Power in Kenya

Geothermal is now the largest source of electricity for Kenya. As a result of the government’s
investment in geothermal energy, since August 2014, the cost of power to industrial and domestic
consumers has fallen by over 30 percent. Kenya’s plan is to increase geothermal capacity by
another 460 MW by 2018. The WBG is the largest development financier of geothermal power in
Kenya. Through IDA and the CIF, the World Bank has provided funding for feasibility studies,
exploration, geothermal steam development, and construction of power plants. The IFC has sup-
ported power generation by private investors, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency has provided investor risk mitigation.




               support at least an additional $58 billion from the MDBs and public and
               ­
               private sources, with $35 billion already committed for projects under
               implementation. These projects will deliver emission reductions of approxi-
               ­
               mately 1.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent over the projects’ lifetime—the
               equivalent of taking 315 million cars off the road—and support more than
               30 million people through climate resilience projects. However, the CIFs are
               already mostly committed, and if they are to continue to play this catalytic
               role and support the WBG and other MDBs to deliver on their climate
               mandate, they would need to be recapitalized in the near future.
               ­
                  The IFC has built a solid track record in blending concessional funds
               ­
               alongside its investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over the
               past five years, the IFC has committed $280 million in concessional finance
               from multilateral and bilateral sources across multiple sectors and instru-
               ments, alongside $1,100 million in IFC investments and $3,800 million from
               other financiers. The IFC’s disciplined blended finance criteria (to ensure
               additionality beyond what the IFC can do for its own account, targeting and
               leveraging subsidies to minimize market distortion), and its own account
               co-investment requirements ensure significant leverage in every transaction.
               When reviewing all donor fund sources and instruments from FY10 to date,
               the overall leverage ratio is 1:17. That ratio may become lower if new alloca-
               tions emphasize challenging areas like infrastructure, agriculture, and IDA
               countries and fragile and conflict-affected situations. The IFC currently has an
               unfunded, concept-approved, blended finance pipeline of at least $300 mil-
               lion, mostly in infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and MNA, which

               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                          29
cannot proceed because of the lack of (geographically and sectorally) flexible
concessional finance. If that financing were available, it could leverage at least
$500 million of IFC funds and $1.7 billion from other investors.
   There is an ongoing need for concessional finance, IDA and non-IDA,
to  support the WBG in accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to
­
renewable energy, and expand energy efficiency. Although some renewable
energy technologies are now competitive with fossil fuels in several markets,
targeted concessional finance will still be needed to accelerate this transition.
Concessional financing will help de-risk investments and lower the cost of
capital, which is substantially higher in developing countries. Concessional
finance can therefore help level the playing field between low-carbon projects
and fossil fuel–based technology by addressing viability gaps, such as those
associated with high capital costs or different types of risk (such as first-mover
risk, technology risk, sovereign risk, and financing risk). In addition, conces-
sional finance will support critical enabling infrastructure, such as transmis-
sion, smart grids, and solar parks, to help lower transaction costs and allow
higher penetration of renewable energy. Another market barrier that conces-
sional finance could help address is the weak creditworthiness of the power
off-takers in many of the markets, which presents a key challenge for attract-
ing private capital.
   Concessional finance is also needed to fund the incremental costs associ-
ated with “climate proofing” infrastructure investments and for technical
assistance and project preparation work. Even if the incremental costs associ-
ated with making infrastructure more resilient to climate change impacts
result in savings later and are cost-efficient overall, financing higher upfront
costs may be challenging, and there is a strong case for this funding to be
made concessional in the smallest, poorest, and most vulnerable countries. In
many countries, concessional funding is also needed to support the design of
policies, strengthen institutional capacity, and prepare projects, all aimed at
expanding the pipeline of financeable climate-smart projects. The WBG will
also need sustained, ongoing access to trust fund resources—such as the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the Global
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)—to support analytic
work, policy dialogue, and project preparation activities.
   Additional concessional funds will be key to supporting the WBG in meet-
ing its new climate targets and mobilizing private sector participation at scale.
A strong IDA replenishment will be critical to allowing the WBG to meet the
climate objectives set out in this Action Plan, which is based on an IDA18
replenishment comparable to IDA17. In addition, the WBG would need to be
able to access further non-IDA concessional climate finance, comparable at
least to past amounts, for the areas noted. This kind of non-IDA concessional
climate funding (especially through the CIFs and bilateral funds such as the
IFC-Canada Climate Change Program) has in the past allowed IDA, IBRD,
and IFC to finance climate investments that would not have been possible
without this concessional financing. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are
counting on significant non-IDA concessional financial support to meet the
targets in this Action Plan.

   Although the WBG is working strategically with the GCF and sees possibil-
ities for strong collaboration, uncertainties exist around how this process will
move forward and how much concessional finance might be available from
this source. There remains a risk of a global shortage of access to leveraged
“climate finance” for transformative activities in the critical period from Paris
through 2020.
   Options are being explored and will be considered in June 2016, at the
request of the CIF Trust Fund Committee, for the future role of the CIFs to
(i)  support the MDBs and help them deliver on their increased climate
mandates, and (ii) catalyze action where gaps persist in the climate finance
­
architecture. This will include options for: (i) mobilizing more private sector
investments at a larger scale by leveraging finance from institutional investors
and through a broader offer of risk mitigation instruments in key infrastruc-
ture sectors, (ii) catalyzing private sector investments in resilience, (iii) using
innovative financial instruments for natural resources, and (iv) enhancing
efficiency in the use of public finance by deploying more targeted conces-
sional finance.
   The WBG will work with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to iden-
tify ways to deepen collaboration in the future. The World Bank has been one
of the largest implementing agencies for the GEF in the past, with climate
change playing a dominant role, contributing substantial leverage to the GEF
as a whole, and contributing the largest transformational impacts. Although
the total share of GEF funding through the World Bank and other MDBs has
fallen over the past two replenishment periods, there are good examples of
GEF support that helps enable the WBG to innovate and mainstream climate
through larger platforms, like the Sustainable Cities and Amazon Programs,
and other investments. The WBG will continue to work with the GEF to
mainstream the Paris climate commitments through its ongoing development
work, while advocating a continued reduction in transaction costs in the
operating model. Under the Paris Agreement, the GEF has been given a
renewed mandate on capacity building and support for the NDC process.
In the coming months, the WBG will work with the GEF to identify more
specific opportunities to collaborate in this regard, especially to support
actionable investment strategies.
   Going forward and regardless of the available resources, the WBG will
further enhance the use of concessional financing to increase impact, and
­
leverage private capital. Countries will need the appropriate combination of
concessional development finance, concessional climate finance, and other
forms of financial and technical support. Concessional climate finance will be
concentrated on the incremental cost of climate action, redirecting invest-
ment flows, and maximizing impact. The WBG will also work with partners
to ensure that policy options (including pricing), institutional practices, and
reforms (such as structured bidding and strengthening of offtake agreements
in the power sector) are deployed to minimize the required level of conces-
sional finance. As part of the work being done for the CIF Trust Fund
Committee, a “concessionality framework” will be completed by June 2016 to
help more systematically guide when and where and how much concessional

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                    31
finance would be appropriate in different situations. The IFC will continue
to  use its rigorous screening, established concessionality and financial sus-
tainability principles, and strong governance framework for its blended
finance projects.
   Although the amounts of climate finance currently available are limited
with respect to climate needs, the WBG will continue to facilitate country
access to a menu of external climate finance instruments, and work with part-
ners and donors to harmonize, simplify, and rationalize access to concessional
finance, especially in forestry, where climate finance remains fragmented,
which increases transaction costs. The IFC and the World Bank will continue
to coordinate approaches to concessional finance, when the ultimate benefi-
ciary is the private sector, to leverage most effectively the WBG’s strengths
and minimize market distortions.
   Over the coming months, in consultation with its shareholders, the WBG
will articulate a more comprehensive, integrated strategy on how to balance
the need for a robust IDA18 replenishment with the mobilization and man-
agement of non-IDA concessional finance, as well as in relation to IBRD/IFC/
MIGA financial capacity discussions in the context of the Forward Look
Initiative. These are complex, interrelated strategic questions, and non-IDA
concessional resources raise wider strategic issues, which, while very impor-
tant for the Action Plan, cannot be addressed in its context.

5. Priority III: Scale Up
Climate Action
To help client countries meet their development and climate objectives, the
WBG will deepen and scale up its action in six high-impact areas: (i) renew-
able energy and energy efficiency; (ii) sustainable mobility; (iii) sustainable
and resilient cities; (iv) climate-smart land use, water, and food security;
(v) green competitiveness; and (vi) leaving no one behind. The WBG will in
particular increase its action toward resilience and adaptation to climate
change.
   The actions in each impact area have been selected and prioritized based on
(i) where transformation is an imperative to meet client and global climate
goals; (ii) where the WBG has a comparative advantage, has been successful,
and can make a difference; and (iii) where client demand or appropriate
market conditions are observed in some countries or regions. These actions
­
will involve scaling up what works, deploying existing tools where relevant,
developing new tools and solutions (often with partners), piloting in selected
countries—ensuring replicability and maximizing the demonstration effect—
and then rolling out more broadly, based on specific demand. Each high-­
impact area and its related actions are discussed in turn.



Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
Renewable energy and energy efficiency are critical for stabilizing climate
change and reaching universal access to energy, and require an integrated
approach. Around 1.1 billion people worldwide still live without access to
electricity. Providing universal access to affordable, reliable, and renewable
energy is vital to ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity,
with the lowest possible emissions. To ensure that global warming remains
below 2°C, it is critical to accelerate improvements in energy efficiency and
more rapidly de-carbonize energy supply. The NDCs announced in Paris go
a long way in this direction, but still fall short of the 2°C target. Renewable
energy—including hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal—is instrumen-
tal in reaching this goal. However, renewables cannot scale up without the
appropriate enabling environment, governance of the energy system, system
planning, and the necessary investment in transmission and distribution, in
first-of and high-risk generation capacity, and sometimes in non-renewable
production.
   In the past 15 years, the renewable energy market has grown from 46.8 to
467.9 GW in cumulative capacity. This growth has been supported by signifi-
cant decreases in the price of renewable energy, coupled with favorable national
policies that aim to reduce pollution and increase energy independence.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that non-hydro renewables, just
6 percent of global electricity in 2014, will reach at least 33 percent of global

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                  33
 electricity production by 2040 (46 percent with hydroelectricity), with most of
 the projected growth (78 percent) occurring in developing countries.  The
 cumulative installed capacity of large, grid-tied solar in non-OECD coun-
 tries  is expected to require about $1.3 trillion in new capacity investment
 through 2040. Onshore wind is expected to grow in developing countries by
 585 percent through 2040, driven by India, with investments of approximately
 $1.8 trillion. Hydroelectric capacity will also grow in emerging markets,
 by about 64 percent, needing approximately $1 trillion in the next 25 years.
    Energy efficiency investments will also be critical to meeting carbon
 reduction objectives. These investments are often cost-effective and pro-
 duce large economic and development co-benefits; many countries have
 energy efficiency commitments in their NDC. However, challenges remain
 in implementing business models that work at scale to produce greater
 energy efficiency. According to the International Energy Agency, 50 per-
 cent of the potential for reducing GHG emissions will come from energy
­efficiency gains.
    The SE4All initiative and the WBG’s Energy Sector Directions Paper form
 the cornerstone of the WBG’s energy objectives. WBG energy financing has
 topped $49 billion since 2010, of which more than $21 billion was for energy
 efficiency and renewable energy projects—of this, $5.8 billion was the IFC’s
 own account investments (see box 5.1). Of the balance of $28 billion, most
 has been to improve access, sector reform, and transmission and distribution.

  Hydropower in Nepal

  The world’s second richest country in inland water resources, Nepal can meet not just its own
  electricity needs, but also serve energy-hungry neighbors like Bangladesh and India. Yet, Nepal’s
  30 million people remain starved for electricity. One major challenge is to address the grid inter-
  face for small and micro hydro plants, so the World Bank—with the Asia Sustainable and
  Alternative Energy program—provides policy, operational recommendations, and advice on
  reforms to government and development partners. The World Bank Group (WBG)—through the
  International Development Association and International Finance Corporation (IFC)—also
  approved $84.6 million in financing for Kabeli, the first project-financed hydro plant in the coun-
  try, with support for the Investment Board of Nepal to improve its ability to facilitate the develop-
  ment of hydro projects in line with international standards.

  Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Turkey

  The $100 million invested by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) alongside the $500 million from
  the World Bank accelerated the development of small hydro and wind energy facilities, and pio-
  neered industrial-scale energy efficiency through the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey
  and  the Development Bank of Turkey. Following the successful implementation of its initial

Box 5.1  Promoting Renewable Power Generation and Energy
Efficiency (continued)
$500 million loan, the World Bank approved an additional $500 million loan in November 2011.
Overall, the $100 million in CTF financing leveraged $1.53 billion, and the Development Bank of
Turkey and Industrial Development Bank of Turkey were able to attract an additional $1 billion
for renewable energy and energy efficiency from other international financiers. The project has
financed 960 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity and achieved energy savings of 2,100
Tcal for a total greenhouse gas emission reduction of 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
per year.

Concentrated Solar in South Africa

In 2011, South Africa launched a program aimed at awarding 3,600 MW of private sector conces-
sions for renewable energy production, including concentrated solar power (CSP). As is typical
with first installations, CSP faced high upfront costs. The IFC’s investment in the first two CSP
projects—KaXu and Khi—with $41.5 million in concessional finance (CTF) and $154.3 million
from the IFC’s own account, leveraged an additional $1.2 billion in financing for a total project
size of $1.4 billion. The IFC’s first-mover position, enabled by strategic use of blended finance,
lowered the perceived risk for a new technology and established a track record for CSP that led to
a competitive private sector market. Multiple rounds of bids resulted in reduced bid tariffs and
project costs for the CSP investments.

Green Building Code and Certification Program

The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) program provides technical assistance
to governments and the private sector on mandatory building codes and voluntary certification,
to raise the minimum standards of resource efficiency and carbon intensity while incentivizing
private sector innovation and leadership. The EDGE program convenes building sector stake-
holders around a metrics-driven vision of green buildings as superior financial assets, contribut-
ing to firms’ profitability and countries’ competitiveness. Partnering with financial institutions,
EDGE aims to facilitate $91 billion in green investment a year by FY23.



               Since FY11, more than 80 percent of IBRD/IDA lending for power generation
               has been in renewable energy, with fossil fuel investments limited—as guided
               by the WBG’s Energy Sector Directions Paper—to those justified by emer-
               gency situations, strong cases for development impacts, or when they support
               a transition to a cleaner energy mix. The WBG has not financed any green-
               field coal projects since FY10. The IFC has grown its grid-tied renewable
               energy investment business at a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent
               over the past 10 years, and the IFC’s own account investment in green build-
               ings has reached $1 billion (with $400 million mobilization). Between 2013
               and 2015, WBG financing brought new or improved electricity supply to
               nearly 29 million people.
                  The WBG supports technical assistance through partnerships and trust
               funds, such as ESMAP and the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.

               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                           35
Recent tools include the Global Tracking Framework to track progress in
countries, and the Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy indicators
to help countries improve the enabling environment for investing in clean
energy and access. The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE)
Green Building Market Transformation Program provides advice to govern-
ments on building codes and supports green building certification (box 5.1).
Codes are in implementation in four countries and in development in three.
The EDGE certification is available for 125 emerging markets.
   Going forward, the WBG will carry out long-term system planning to
identify and accelerate the implementation of the most economic low-carbon
­
options in client countries, and support with lending and assistance as appro-
priate, to help client countries deliver affordable and reliable energy services in
a manner that is consistent with their NDCs, the global climate goals, and the
WBG’s Energy Sector Directions Paper. The WBG will work to lower net car-
bon emissions from energy generation, transmission, and distribution invest-
ment projects, as well as from energy efficiency investments. It will continue to
support natural gas in accordance with the Energy Sector Directions Paper.
   The World Bank will de-risk renewable energy investments, through policy
advice, regulatory reforms, direct investment funding, guarantees, and other
products, and by reducing resource risks and using development policy
financing, the Program for Results, or technical assistance. The indicative
cumulative target will be scaled up 20 GW in renewable energy generation
over five years, representing a doubling of current World Bank additions to
renewable capacity over the previous five-year period.
   Further, the World Bank will facilitate the expansion of renewable energy
by supporting grid infrastructure and systems (for example, grid planning,
solar parks, electricity market design, and regulations for grid access and
operations), with the aim to enable an additional 10 GW of variable renew-
able energy sources to become integrated into grids over the next five years.
This requires improving the ability of power systems to absorb more variable
renewable electricity by investing in: (i) smarter transmission and distribu-
tion grids; (ii) hydro storage and, increasingly, electric batteries; (iii) natural
gas-based generation to balance variable renewable energy, especially where
hydro-based storage is not available; and (iv) expansion of power grid inter-
connections and scaling-up of regional energy trade to allow efficient utiliza-
tion of renewable energy resources.
   The WBG will focus on crowding in private sector funding for clean energy,
with the objective of mobilizing $25 billion of commercial funds over FY16–
FY20, more than double the amount mobilized over the past five-year period.
Crowding in this funding and expanding access to renewables will require a
significant volume of concessional finance.
   Country-level engagements will be supported by using analytical instru-
ments and tools to engage in upstream dialogue on policies, regulations, and
practices. The WBG will support the sharing of good practices, such as the
“Scaling Solar” initiative in Africa, which replicates transparent bidding with
pre-agreed template documents and stapled finance from IFC, MIGA, and
World Bank partial risk guarantees, to reduce payment risk from power

36	                                 World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
off-takers and concessional financing to buy down costs. The WBG will con-
tinue to support the recently announced International Solar Alliance, which
brings together 122 countries to share knowledge, technology, costs, research
and development, innovation, and project financing mechanisms that reduce
financing costs for grid and off-grid solar power.
   The WBG will explore opportunities to facilitate and encourage technolog-
ical innovation in the energy sector. Innovation will be critical to achieving
the level of de-carbonization needed for a 2°C world. The exact nature of the
WBG’s role in this area will be defined over the next year.
   The IFC and MIGA will support the growth of grid-connected clean energy
by focusing on large hydropower, wind, and solar; continuing to open new
markets with “first-of ” investments; increasing programmatic interventions
to remove barriers; and supporting specific instruments (for example, renew-
able energy performance insurance). The IFC expects financing for grid-­
connected renewable energy to remain approximately constant—around
$1 billion on average.
   The IFC and MIGA will help industrial and commercial clients directly access
renewable energy by financing captive power or brokering power purchase
agreements, and increasing investments in commercial/residential rooftop solar
and off-grid solar home systems. The IFC is developing de-risking tools and
renewable energy insurance that will help facilitate additional outside invest-
ment in the distributed renewable market. The objective is a net increase in
investments in distributed renewable energy, and the opening of new markets.
   The World Bank will also ensure that 100 percent of World Bank hydro-
power and other energy investments are adapted to climate change, and cre-
ate financial mechanisms to encourage upfront investments in resilient
hydropower infrastructure. The IFC will look at resilient hydropower invest-
ment opportunities in the private sector, but making climate adaptation the
market standard will require time and effort, and concessional finance for
some of the first private sector movers will probably be needed.
   The WBG will invest in energy efficiency, especially in the built environ-
ment. The WBG will increase the share of energy efficiency operations in the
WBG portfolio, with an initial scale-up in the urban space, which offers large
emission reduction potential and where the clearest scale-up models exist. It
will ensure that 50 percent of World Bank infrastructure operations in the
urban space integrates energy efficiency measures (and reduces CO2 and
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions). By 2020, the WBG aims to support at
least 10 operations, investing at least $1 billion to promote energy efficiency
and resilient building. The WBG will further explore new business models
and implementation strategies for further scaling up industrial and residen-
tial energy efficiency and utility demand-side management. The World Bank
will develop action plans in two demonstration countries to reduce emissions
in the health sector.
   The IFC will expand energy efficiency credit lines (box 5.2), propose energy
efficiency components in corporate loans and green bonds, and increase advi-
sory services for sector-level interventions. It will also ensure that 50 percent
of IFC building investments are green certified.

  and Energy Efficiency Projects

  Energy Efficiency Credit Lines in Brazil

  The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC’s) climate credit lines through local banks help
  strengthen financial institutions’ capacity to on-lend to climate-related projects. In FY15, the IFC
  provided $100 million from its own account and mobilized an additional $300 million for climate
  credit lines to Itau Unibanco in Brazil. These funds will be used to on-lend to energy efficiency,
  renewable energy, and other climate-related loans.

  Boosting Sustainable Energy Financing in Lebanon

  The IFC together with the IFC–Canada Climate Change Program provided $20 million to
  Fransabank and its leasing arm, the Lebanese Leasing Company, to promote the first sustainable
  energy financing in Lebanon. The role of blended finance was instrumental in making this financ-
  ing package viable, by providing the bank with adequate incentive to offset the additional costs of
  establishing a new line of business. This project, accompanied by IFC advisory services, is expected
  to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in Lebanon and set a new stan-
  dard of sustainable energy financing for other banks to follow.




   The World Bank will continue to play a key role as an Implementing Agency
of the Montreal Protocol, working to channel Multilateral Fund grants to help
countries meet their international regulatory compliance targets, especially
where climate impacts and mitigation benefits are highest. The World Bank
will support clients to stay at the leading edge of the best feasible technology
alternatives to reduce HFCs—which have high greenhouse gas potentials—
especially in the refrigeration and cooling equipment manufacturing sectors,
in combination with energy efficiency, helping to transform domestic and
international markets. The same technical knowledge will be brought proac-
tively into World Bank operations to help teams and clients identify opportu-
nities in the refrigeration and cooling sectors and boost climate benefit goals.
   The WBG will work with governments, oil companies, and other develop-
ment institutions to end ongoing routine flaring of gas at oil production sites
around the world by 2030, and to avoid entirely routine flaring at all new oil
fields. So far, 17 countries have signed on to the World Bank-led “Zero Routine
Flaring by 2030” initiative, as have 20 oil companies and 11 development
institutions. The initiative aims to cover at least two-thirds of global gas flar-
ing by 2020, compared with more than 40 percent today. The initiative is
important because of flaring’s considerable climate impacts: emissions of
CO2, methane, and black carbon (soot). Flaring is a major source of the black
carbon that deposits on the Arctic snow and ice cap, accelerating melting.
Ending flaring is also good resource management—if converted to electricity,
the gas flared around the world could produce more electricity than what is
currently consumed on the entire African continent.

               Sustainable Mobility
               Sustainable mobility is needed to achieve countries’ development and climate
               objectives, and the transport sector needs deeper action on climate adapta-
               tion and resilience. Actions to stabilize climate change will fall short if they do
               not include the transport sector. Investments in low-carbon solutions are
               urgently needed in the sector, and opportunities exist in the design of public
               transport, vehicle efficiency, demand management, regional development,
               and land use. An estimated 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions is
               thought to be possible by 2030 from new information and communications
               technologies (ICT). But transport is also vulnerable to climate risk, which can
               affect the entire transport value chain: new and existing transport systems
               urgently need greater investment in resilience. The challenge is how to
               respond to rising global demand for mobility and greater interconnectedness
               in a sustainable manner while improving the resilience of transport networks.
               With 76 percent of NDCs including transport actions, there is strong poten-
               tial demand from clients to address climate change in the sector.
                  Currently, over FY11–FY15, the World Bank’s contribution in transport
               and ICT to climate benefits is $7.3 billion (26 percent), driven by urban
               mobility and railways, with a strong regional focus on EAP, LCR, and SAR
               (box 5.3). Climate co-benefits in adaptation reached $373 million over the
               period. Transport has the second largest volume of climate co-benefits in the
               World Bank. The MDBs made a concerted move at the 2012 United Nations
               (UN) Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), where they pledged
               $175 billion in loans and  grants for more sustainable transport over the

Cebu Bus Rapid Transit

This $141  million  financial package, consisting of loans from the World Bank and the Clean
Technology Fund, will help finance the construction of a 23-kilometer bus rapid transit (BRT)
system along a major transport corridor in Cebu City in the central Philippines. The corridor
spans from Bulacao to Talamban in the city, and will include transit ways, stations, terminals, a
depot, and other facilities. Expected to carry 330,000 passengers daily, the new BRT system will
improve the mobility of Cebu residents while reducing pollution and increasing travel safety. The
project will also install a state-of-the-art computerized traffic management system for the entire
city, to ensure smoother overall traffic flow and provide other improvements to integrate the BRT
with other modes of transport.

Mozambique Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program

Phase II of this project is addressing the increased vulnerability of road infrastructure to floods
and cyclonic activity through: (i) the preparation of national design and construction standards
that enhance climate resilience; (ii) the piloting of improved road designs; and (iii) “building back
better” 196 kilometers of road damaged by the Limpopo floods in January 2013.

2012–22 decade. At COP21 in Paris, the MDBs joined forces to commit to
ramp up climate action in transport.
   The WBG will help countries develop sustainable mobility alternatives
and  implement transport adaptation options, especially in lagging regions.
The WBG will increase the share of the transport portfolio that contributes
to  mitigation and resilience. It will pursue sustainable urban mobility
­
opportunities across all regions and multimodal freight operations in several
portfolios. It aims to reach $2 billion in lending for adaptation over FY16–
FY20 (four times the level in the previous five-year period) and enhance the
resilience of the road portfolio. The WBG will partner with the GFDRR and
other donors to create a knowledge platform to build climate resilience in the
roads sector. The IFC will build on existing engagements with municipal cli-
ents and develop new relationships with creditworthy cities that are looking
to address congestion and mobility issues.
   This scale-up of investment will be paired with targeted analytical work, to
provide advisory services to countries that need support for identifying spe-
cific interventions in the transport sector (for example, for future NDCs and
trucking, fuels, and vehicles). In particular, the WBG will focus on improving
the competitiveness and fuel efficiency of the trucking sectors and promoting
green freight, and on investing in capacity building on adaptation.
   The WBG will lead a global coalition to develop a framework for sustain-
able mobility. The World Bank has been tasked with leading the transport
track of the Climate Action 2016 Summit, which will take place May 5–6,
2016. This will deepen and expand the multi-stakeholder action coalitions
launched at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit in 2014. The sum-
mit provides an opportunity to link the transport-related climate change and
sustainable development agendas, and bring coherence and clarification of
goals to the international community.



Sustainable and Resilient Cities
Cities are hotspots for global emissions and climate vulnerability. With more
than 80 percent of global GDP generated in cities, urbanization can contrib-
ute to sustainable growth. Significant urbanization is expected in the coming
decades in all regions. Cities are responsible for 80 percent of GHG emissions,
and up to 80 percent of adaptation costs are expected to be borne in urban
areas. Building sustainable and resilient cities requires an integrated and
­
multisector approach that combines planning, policies and regulations, and
investments. Delayed action would create lock-ins in high-risk or carbon-­
intensive patterns. In particular, buildings offer a large potential for immedi-
ate, cost-effective action with short-term development gains through lower
energy expenditures, better comfort, and higher resilience. Tackling urban
development in an integrated way is essential for meeting climate change mit-
igation and adaptation challenges and is in line with many countries’ NDCs.
  In the past 10 years, World Bank commitments for cities almost doubled, to
an annual average of $4.11 billion (FY09–FY13) and several resilient cities

               urbanization is managed for resilient, inclusive, and sustainable growth
               (box 5.4). Urbanization Reviews have been completed in 14 countries. The
               WBG helps reduce the climate impact on cities through investments in waste,
               water, transport, and buildings. The Global Platform for Sustainable Cities
               promotes an integrated approach to sustainable urban planning and manage-
               ment and will serve as a key knowledge platform to connect and support

Metro Manila Flood Master Plan

After the massive flooding in 2009 in the wake of tropical storms Ondoy and Pepeng, with the
technical and financial support of the World Bank, the Philippine government prepared a Flood
Management Master Plan for Metro Manila and Surrounding Areas. The plan, approved by the
National Economic and Development Authority Board on September 4, 2012, proposes a set of
priority structural and nonstructural measures to provide sustainable flood management up to a
certain safety level. The total estimated cost for the implementation of the Master Plan is about
₱352 billion (about $8 billion) over a 20- to 25-year period. The World Bank will support the
implementation of part of this plan.

Ho Chi Minh Flood Risk Project

The $436 million Ho Chi Minh City Floods project (FY17) will strengthen the ability of Ho Chi
Minh City and its people, economic assets, and commercial businesses to withstand the impacts
of natural hazards and climate change. The project will strengthen the capacities of urban inte-
grated flood risk management, including urban planning, institutional coordination, flood fore-
casting, and early warning systems, at the city and provincial/regional/national levels.

Emergency Urban Environment Project in Benin

The World Bank is supporting Beninese municipalities as they work to improve sanitation condi-
tions in the cities of Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Ouidah, Porto-Novo, and Sèmè-Podji. These joint
efforts will create better living conditions for 1,426,000 beneficiaries and reduce by 30 percent the
number of households vulnerable to flooding. Benin’s local governments are also benefiting from
training and technical assistance that will help boost disaster preparedness.

Nanchang Urban Rail Project

In June 2013, the World Bank approved a loan of $250 million to support the development of an
urban rail line in Nanchang Municipality in Jiangxi Province in China, a city that has expanded
rapidly in recent years. The project finances construction and equipment for urban rail Line 2
(24 kilometers and 21 stations), as well as technical assistance to improve ridership levels, increase
land value around stations, and improve financial management for the Nanchang Urban Rail
Company. The project will directly benefit about 506,000 people, providing efficient accessibility
to their homes, jobs, and better urban services in terms of speed, safety, and commuting quality,
and will result in lower carbon emissions.

integrated solutions. The Resilient Cities Program aims to help cities adapt
and withstand shocks while maintaining essential functions, with CityStrength
Diagnostic and City Creditworthiness Academies. ESMAP’s City Energy
Efficiency Transformation Program helps identify, develop, and mobilize
financing for investment programs in urban energy efficiency. Through its
focus on climate-smart urban development, the IFC has invested in transport,
waste, and green buildings—for example, with investments in public transit
deals in the cities of Izmir and Istanbul in Turkey (with MIGA), and Bogotá
in Colombia and Lima in Peru, through the IFC’s subnational lending
program.
    Going forward, the WBG will further integrate climate into urban plan-
ning. The WBG will support cities directly and by developing tools and
knowledge products through the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities, and
roll these out in at least 30 cities by 2020.
    The WBG will develop and pilot in 15 cities by 2020 a city-based resilience
approach that integrates infrastructure development, land use planning,
DRM, institutions/governance, social components, and infrastructure
­investment. It will scale up the cross-GPs team that provides assistance to task
 team leaders (TTLs) on incorporating the principles of integrated urban
 water management (multi-stakeholder, integrating urban, environment,
 water ­supply, sanitation planning, and investments) to improve efficiencies
 and ­outcomes, to ensure climate resilience.
    To ensure consistency between infrastructure development and urbaniza-
 tion, the WBG will develop and pilot solution packages for transit-oriented
 development. By 2020, transport-oriented development solution packages
 will be piloted in at least five cities. The IFC and MIGA will increase invest-
 ments in municipal transport, leveraging advisory engagements to create the
 pipeline.



Climate-Smart Land Use, Water, and
Food Security
Climate-smart land use is central for food security and resilience, poverty
reduction, GHG emission reductions, and natural resource protection. More
than one billion people are undernourished today; the world will need to
produce at least 50 percent more food by 2050. With current practices, the
­
world will face a 40 percent shortfall between the forecasted demand and
available supply of water by 2030. Climate-smart land use, applied across the
agricultural, forestry, fisheries, and conservation sectors, can increase food
production and farmers’ income while offering large opportunities for cli-
mate resilience, emissions reduction, more sustainable water use, and carbon
sequestration. Land use–related emissions currently represent 19 to 29 per-
cent of global GHG emissions, over half of which is caused by deforestation.
At COP21, leading global agribusiness leaders outlined their ambition to
make 50 percent more food available and strengthen the resilience of farming
communities while reducing GHG emissions by 50 percent.

42	                                World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
                  Climate-smart land use includes different components: (i) climate-smart
               agriculture, an approach to better managing the food and agricultural system
               to simultaneously increase productivity and resilience, and reduce GHG
               emissions (box 5.5); (ii) forestry; (iii) land restoration; (iv) ecosystem-based
               adaptation and coastal area management projects; and (v) improved water
               management, including groundwater. These actions all seek to enhance the
               ways in which our natural capital can protect people’s assets in the face of
               climate change, and enhance their incomes through ecosystem services, water
               supply, and flood protection.
                  The WBG has a large portfolio in agriculture, water, forestry, and environ-
               mental management. Currently, the WBG is scaling up climate-smart
               agriculture, has been financing many projects with forestry components,
               ­
               and  has  played a catalytic role in sustainable land management. In 2015,

Box 5.5  Examples of Projects Promoting Climate-Smart
Agriculture

Climate-Smart Agriculture in Vietnam

In Vietnam, rice is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, irrigated rice farming
being the largest contributor. The Agricultural Competitiveness Project introduced farming prac-
tices that: (i) reduced water use by 20–25 percent and fertilizer use by 10–15 percent; (ii) reduced
GHG emissions by 30–35 percent, equivalent to six tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per hectare;
(iii) are being scaled up to an area of 250,000 hectares of core rice zones involving 200,000 small-
holder rice farmers; and (iv) expect to avoid the emission of about 2.5 million tons of CO2 over
five years.

National Dairy Support Project, India

Dairying is a major source of livelihood for a large part of the population of rural India. Milk and
milk products are also an important part of food and nutritional security for more than one bil-
lion Indians. The project will support long-term investments in animal breeding, extensive train-
ing of dairy farmers, and doorstep delivery of artificial insemination and ration balancing advisory
services. Balancing animal feed and nutrition has the potential not only to increase milk yield, but
also to contribute to reduced methane emissions.

West African Agricultural Productivity Program in Senegal

A lack of rainfall during Senegal’s planting season has led to withered crops and low yields,
obliging farmers to reseed in an effort to recover their losses. An emergency program initiated
by the World Bank’s West African Agricultural Productivity Program is providing one-time
subsidies on the sale of almost 2,000 tons of certified maize, millet, and sorghum seeds. The
subsidized seeds produce higher yields, are more drought-resistant, and have shorter maturity
cycles.

agriculture and related sectors; 42 percent of the Agriculture GP’s pipeline
projects deliver climate-smart agriculture, and the World Bank has commit-
ted to 100 percent of agriculture operations being climate-smart by 2019. The
World Bank portfolio also includes approximately $22 billion in lending
in the water sector. The WBG has financed $15.7 billion in projects with for-
estry components (2002–15), and manages about $2.2 billion in climate
finance for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation,
Conservation of Forest Stocks, Sustainable Management of Forests and
Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+). In sustainable land man-
agement, the WBG has played a catalytic role from China to Ethiopia, and
committed at COP21 to restore 100 million hectares (ha) of degraded land in
Africa, at a cost of approximately $750 million. In coastal zones, the WBG has
$1 billion in projects with resilience and coastal fisheries benefits.
   Going forward, the WBG will deliver on climate-smart agriculture at scale
to increase the efficiency and resilience of food systems. Climate-smart agri-
culture profiles and investment plans will be developed by 2020 for at least
40  countries, and climate-smart agriculture programs will be delivered at
scale under six focal areas: (i) the introduction of hybrid seeds and carbon
capture practices for major crops, including scaling of agroforestry, in three
regions; (ii) the implementation at scale of high-efficiency/low-energy-use
irrigation programs in the Africa, South Asia, and Middle-East and North
Africa regions (AFR/SAR/MNA); (iii) livestock productivity increases
through “feed and breed” and simultaneously pursuing emission reductions
with manure management/biodigesters; (iv) leveraged private capital and
purchasing to increase the medium-term capital flow for producers, to
develop resilient supply chains, aimed at having at least 10 initiatives linking
food supply chains with smallholders, thereby increasing resilience and
reducing emissions by 2020; (v) energy solutions for agribusiness (for exam-
ple, solar and biogas); and (vi) mainstreamed risk assessment and manage-
ment, including using suitable insurance products. The IFC will examine how
to increase agricultural adaptation investments, including building resilience
into agricultural supply chains. Investments in the agricultural sector are
expected to require concessional finance and innovative financing models,
such as weather index insurance.
   The WBG will also scale up its interventions on forests via the implementa-
tion of the new Forest Action Plan (FAP) FY16–FY20. The Forest Action Plan
seeks to fully embed forests in the development priorities of countries, by
focusing more deliberately on the positive contributions that forests make to
poverty reduction, food security, economic development, and the climate
action agenda. The FAP builds on an in-depth assessment of the WBG’s forest
portfolio over the FY02–FY15 period as well as a detailed analysis of the
emerging demands coming from clients (in particular through their NDCs).
The FAP articulates the WBG’s value proposition to tackle the forest challenge
with sustainable results, and identifies two focus areas for WBG engagement
for the next five years: (i) sustainable forestry, where the WBG aims to
have  investments contributing to sustainable management of forests and
value chains, and (ii)  forest-smart interventions, where the WBG aims to

44	                               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
have interventions in other sectors not come at the expense of forest capital.
These two focus areas build on three cross-cutting themes that aim to improve
the enabling environment and strengthen the foundations for positive forest
outcomes: climate change and resilience, rights and participation; and institu-
tions and governance.
   Under the first focus area, priority actions are to (i) protect and optimize
the management of natural forests, (ii) encourage sustainable plantations and
tree planting, and (iii) support sustainable forest value chains (for timber and
non-timber forest products). Under the second focus area, the WBG aims to
support clients to promote growth that does not come at the expense of their
natural forests, and that properly values and recognizes the contribution of
forest services to the economy; it will aim to promote forest-smart interven-
tions in other sectors (such as agriculture, transport, energy, and extractives)
that consider avoiding or minimizing their potential adverse impact on
forests. To do so, interventions in forests and other economic sectors will be
­
guided by comprehensive, ex ante, and robust information on potential trade-
offs for forests as well as opportunities for restoration. By 2020, the WBG aims
to support REDD+ strategies in more than 50 countries, develop/implement
a large-scale, multisector program promoting “forest-smart” development
and mobilizing IBRD/IDA/REDD+ financing in 10 countries, and prepare
Country Forestry Notes in at least 20 countries.
   The WBG will also work with partners and donors to improve the effective-
ness of forest climate funds, to reduce transaction costs and increase impact.
In the short term, it will work to improve country-level coordination, whereas
in the medium term it may need to work toward rationalization of funds and
financial innovation to improve the performance of results-based instru-
ments while addressing short-term investment funding needs.
   The WBG will produce a series of area-based operations in climate-­sensitive
locations using ecosystem-based adaptation (natural infrastructure), land
restoration, integrated water management, and biodiversity conservation, to
maximize the development benefits and carbon sinks (the target is five oper-
ations in 2020) (box 5.6). It will strive to integrate landscape-scale planning
into infrastructure planning, support the clarification of property rights,
improve land use controls, and include considerations of climate impact
inequality. The World Bank will also ensure that 50 percent of adaptation
projects include ecosystem-based adaptation measures by 2020. Moreover,
the WBG will continue to play its role as a strategic partner in many interna-
tional efforts, like the Bonn Challenge, Global Landscape Forum, and Wealth
Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services global partnership on
ecosystem services and their valuation. By 2020, actions will be underway to
restore 20 million ha in LCR and 100 million ha in Africa, with results seen by
2030; 15 landscape restoration operations will have been developed in Central
Asia, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Vietnam; and environmentally sustainable live-
lihood alternatives will have been implemented in 50 coastal communities in
West Africa.
   The WBG will also promote climate-proof fisheries management by
focusing on critical marine ecosystems in the face of climate-induced

  of forest land, promote sustainable land management of 52,700 ha, and support actions that will
  help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 300 million tons by 2030. Together with the World Bank,
  as lead agency, the World Wildlife Fund and the United Nations Development Programme will be
  implementing the program, which builds on decades of work in the Amazon by governments,
  bilateral and multilateral agencies, civil society organizations, and private donors, but, for the first
  time, takes an integrated and coordinated approach to protecting a significant portion of the

  Mekong Delta Integrated Climate Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Project

  The proposed project is envisioned to be the first phase of a long-term World Bank engagement
  in the Mekong Delta to strengthen integrated climate-resilient management and development
  across different sectors and institutional levels. The project will comprise a combination of struc-
  tural and nonstructural investments, and be informed by the World Bank-financed Building
  Resilience in the Mekong Delta technical assistance. It has been proposed that the project spans a

strengthening links with the “blue economy.” The expanded approach will
be piloted in 10 regionally diverse but heavily fisheries-dependent countries
by 2020.
   The WBG will implement large-scale national and transboundary pro-

Box 5.7  The Niger River Basin Management Project
In the Niger Basin, countries understand the need for investment and cooperative action to over-
come the water and development challenges they face and to build climate resilience. In addition
to their own national-level plans and investment pipelines, the countries have taken several
important steps toward shared planning, management, and development of the Niger Basin,
including establishing the Niger Basin  Authority (NBA); approving the Niger Basin  Water
Charter in 2008; and developing and approving the Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP)
in 2007, which emphasizes development of socioeconomic infrastructure, preservation of
ecosystems in the basin, capacity building, and stakeholder participation. A related $8.2 billion
­
­
investment program was adopted in April 2008.

Building on this momentum, the Niger Basin countries asked the World Bank to support their
efforts to prepare an “Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change in
the Niger River Basin” (CRIP), to identify and elevate the visibility of the important climate adap-
tation and resilience investments that are needed in the Niger Basin. CRIP, as a subset of SDAP, was
prepared through a thorough participatory process, including the nine Niger River riparian coun-
tries and led by the NBA, with support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank,
and launched during the COP21.

The World Bank is now in the process of assisting the NBA and Niger Basin countries in grouping
the first priority actions into thematically homogeneous packages. These themes include (i) cli-
mate-dependent rural livelihoods, (ii) climate variability, and (iii) water stress (as well as a few
other actions that aim at reducing the Niger Basin’s vulnerability to soil degradation and the rising
sea level). Underpinning each of these themes is a critical Knowledge and Governance package,
which includes vulnerability assessments, integrated adaptation, resilience planning for national
and regional institutions, and hydrometeorological information and systems. The World Bank is
considering mobilizing a significant amount  from International Development Association
resources—on the order of $275 million under the first theme—and helping the NBA and Niger
Basin countries mobilize the required amounts for the other two themes.




               Green Competitiveness
               Green competitiveness offers large potential for development benefits and is
               an important building block for the transition toward zero net emissions.
               There is growing demand from client countries to involve their private sectors
               in emerging green business lines and create green jobs. Currently, the Climate
               Technology Program has seven Climate Innovation Centers around the
               world, helping nearly 300 companies to scale up innovative and commercial
               climate solutions. Today, the IFC’s Venture Capital group has $122 million
               invested in 12 climate-related businesses in its portfolio, including in energy
               storage, agriculture, and software companies, in addition to the solar home
               system companies.
                  Going forward, the WBG will support green, innovative sectors in develop-
               ing countries. There is demand from client countries to involve their private

  invested $7 million in Fluidic Energy, which makes rechargeable metal-air batteries. These batter-
  ies are designed to back up telecom networks in Indonesia, which otherwise would require diesel
  generators or lead-acid batteries. The company aims to expand its reach in Asia and enter markets

sectors in growing climate-related sectors and create jobs. The market is large:
up to $6.4 trillion will be invested in climate-related sectors in developing
countries in the coming decade, including energy efficiency, water supply,
and climate-smart agriculture. In 2015, clean tech venture capital investments
grew to $3.3 billion. In some countries, the WBG would support more sys-
tematic analytical/advisory work on the role that green and climate-smart
development can play as a new driver of growth.
   The WBG will support innovation in emerging clean tech markets, enhanced
industrial competitiveness, and business and entrepreneurs (see box 5.8 for an
example). The WBG will pilot innovative approaches to support clients’ climate
technology ecosystems and industrial competitiveness by facilitating policy
and regulations to catalyze private investment and green trade. It will respond
to market failures exacerbated by climate change, with solutions to reduce
energy consumption, water use, and waste in industrial processes, thereby real-
izing a sizable reduction in industrial emissions and increasing competitive-
ness. Further opportunities with equipment manufacturers and through supply
chains will be developed. By 2020, the WBG aims to have assisted 20 countries
in enhancing their capacity to adopt new climate solutions and increase indus-
trial competitiveness in response to climate change. This assistance aims to
include eight new Climate Innovation Centers and support to 10 countries to
increase industry resilience to climate change. Areas of focus will include
greening global value chains and trade practices, establishing eco-industrial
zones, and developing best practices for standards and labeling.
   The IFC will intensify its work throughout the finance value chain for
entrepreneurs, from incubators through private equity, to increase its impact
and grow the market in climate-smart innovation. By 2020, the IFC will have
increased its early-stage investments in key new markets, including the
Internet of Things, distributed systems, and business model innovation.


Leaving No One Behind
In recent years, the WBG has focused on policy development to support the
people most vulnerable to climate change (box 5.9). Poor people are more
exposed, more vulnerable, and less able to cope with and recover from climate
shocks. The WBG will be a voice for the poor and vulnerable, and ensure that

The World Bank, in close partnership with World Meteorological Organization and other donors,
is scaling up its support to hydromet modernization. A new, innovative, “Strengthening Climate
and Disaster Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa” $80 million climate and disaster resilience initia-
tive for Sub-Saharan Africa was launched in June 2015, to help strengthen resilience to extreme
weather events. The purpose of this support is to enhance systematically country and regional
capacities to manage climate and disaster risks and leverage disaster risk management entry
points to promote long-term, resilient development.

Productive Safety Nets Program in Ethiopia

Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) program, which has been financed by the
Government of Ethiopia, World Bank, and 11 development partners, has proven its effectiveness
multiple times since it was set up in 2005. A unique feature of the program is that it responds to
local and larger scale shocks. After the 2011 drought that affected East Africa, the program
expanded coverage to an additional 3.1 million, reaching 9.6 million beneficiaries in two months.
More recently, PSNP has yet again reacted effectively to the 2015 drought, by providing three
rounds of cash transfers to 624,000 people in the country’s highlands.

Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project

The World Bank’s Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project was put in place to help with recovery
after the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand, India. World Bank teams helped communities better
understand the recovery policies and engage in the project by communicating more in the local
language, and promoting transparency and accountability. In addition, model pre-engineered
houses were constructed in each district headquarters, and communities were invited to examine
them. With a greater sense of ownership and understanding of the available options, more than
50 percent of the project beneficiaries started rebuilding their own houses within six months of
the project cycle.

Eastern Caribbean Islands Test Ways to Adapt to Climate Change

In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a newly installed desalination plant addresses water scarcity
on the island of Bequia, powered by a photovoltaic system. In Dominica, a technical irrigation
scheme was implemented and the National Park Management prepared plans to mainstream cli-
mate change. In Saint Lucia, a large tourist resort has installed a rainwater harvesting and wastewa-
ter organic load reduction system, and a flagship building was retrofitted to withstand hurricanes.



               climate policies and impacts do not slow down poverty reduction. Extremely
               vulnerable groups include the very poor—those without access to basic infra-
               structure services and social protection—children, women and the elderly,
               indigenous populations, refugees and migrants, and people living in extremely
               vulnerable areas such as small islands and deltas.

               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                             49
   IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 77 poorest
countries, 39 of which are in Africa, and is the single largest source of donor
funds for basic social services in these countries. In the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2015, IDA commitments totaled $19 billion (including climate and
non-climate operations). Since 2005, the IFC has committed $3.5 billion in
219 climate projects in IDA countries and in FY15, 50 percent of the IFC’s
blended climate finance co-investments went to projects in IDA countries.
Climate change is one of the four thematic areas in IDA17, and IDA action
helps build poor people’s resilience.
   The WBG has targeted action on some of the groups most vulnerable to
climate change, particularly through (i) the REDD+ readiness process, which
has deepened the participation of and collaboration with indigenous peoples;
(ii) the recently revised gender strategy; and (iii) specific strategies on very
vulnerable countries, such as small islands (with specific IDA allocation and
programs) and fragile states and conflict areas (with a commitment to increase
IDA financing to fragile and conflict-affected situation countries by 50 per-
cent), which can also contribute to building climate resilience.
   Building people’s resilience to prepare for and respond to climate disasters
is critical to managing climate impacts and eradicating poverty. Between 1994
and 2013, 6,873 natural disasters worldwide were recorded, which claimed
1.35 million lives or almost 68,000 lives on average each year. The cumulative
economic losses from disasters since 2000 are close to $2.5 trillion. Climate
change will increase the frequency and intensity of disasters in many regions.
Making people—especially the most vulnerable—more resilient to climate-­
related shocks is essential to eradicate poverty. The $1.2 billion Pilot Program
for Climate Resilience already assists developing countries in integrating
climate resilience into development planning.
­
   Going forward, the WBG will support universal access to hydromet infor-
mation and early warning with client countries and international partners
(for example, through the Climate Risk Early Warning Systems and the Global
Framework for Climate Services). The WBG increased its contribution to
DRM from 9.4 to 12.0 percent of the portfolio between FY12 and FY15, that
is, from $3.7 billion to $5.7 billion. The Hydromet Program has already sup-
ported modernized weather, climate, and hydrological services in countries
around the world. The WBG will help build the institutions, observation sys-
tems, decision-making processes, and service delivery focus. By 2020, the
goal is that an additional 100 million people in 15 developing countries,
including least developed countries and small island developing states, will
have access to high-quality hydromet data and early warning systems. To
achieve this, the WBG will mobilize resources to support universal access
to climate information and core climate services.
   The WBG will help scale up adaptive social protection, by creating a
multi-GP team and providing solution packages to support this work. The
WBG also supports innovative adaptive social protection systems, including in
Ethiopia and Pakistan. By 2020, the aim is to scale up these services so that an
additional 50 million people will be covered by climate-adaptive social protec-
tion schemes, and be better able to cope with natural disasters and other shocks.

50	                               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
   The WBG will also scale up sovereign disaster risk financing. In 2014 alone,
World Bank projects in more than 12 countries helped improve financial
resilience, with better post-disaster financial response capacity. Significant
programs are already in place in the Pacific and the Caribbean. The aim is to
add five more countries covered by financial protection instruments, includ-
ing insurance, risk pools, and contingent finance, by 2020. Beyond sovereign
schemes, the WBG is currently working with local government units (for
example, in the Philippines) to provide financial cover for natural disasters.
The World Bank will work to expand this, if successful, to other countries.
It  will also develop and expand contingent finance instruments for IDA
countries.
   The WBG will scale up and expand the use of community-driven develop-
ment approaches to strengthen resilience at the local level. By 2020, ex ante
resilience investments will be integrated into seven community-driven devel-
opment country programs.
   Specific interventions will also include programs for the most vulnerable
locations (for example, small islands) and populations (for example, migrants
and refugees). The WBG will scale up the Small Island States Resilience
Initiative to build capacity and for better use of existing, fragmented funds,
and mobilize increased financing for small island states. The WBG will
(i)  facilitate scaled-up and more efficient resource flows, among others, by
increasing absorption capacity and institutional capacity; (ii) strengthen
global knowledge of the specific needs and challenges of small islands; and
(iii) strengthen implementation support (by building capacity for eventual
direct access to global climate funds, etc.). The WBG will also produce a flag-
ship analytical report on climate change and migration/conflict (FY17).
   The WBG will strengthen and reinforce action on climate and health.
Subject to available resources, the WBG will increase its capacity to respond
to the 32 IBRD and 40 IDA-eligible countries that have included health as
a focus area in their NDCs, with expectations that by the end of FY17, two
countries will have vulnerability assessments; by the end of FY18, two coun-
tries will have climate-smart surveillance and early warning systems; and by
the end of FY19, 75 percent of TTLs will be trained in climate change and
health, and 20 percent of new health, nutrition, and population projects will
consider climate in their design.

6. Priority IV: Align Internal
Processes and Work with
Others
To enhance its impact and support its client countries, the WBG will
strengthen its partnerships, internal processes, and organization.


Work in Partnership with Others
The WBG already has a very large set of partnerships in the climate change
domain, with other development actors, the research and academic commu-
nities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and business groups and
associations. Some of these partnerships are broad and highly strategic—such
as the work with other MDBs—while others are targeted (for example, on
some methodological issues).
   To complement its own action, the WBG will work with others to benefit
from what they do best, and ensure synergies across actors in the field.
But partnerships will be more selective and strategic, so that more synergies
can be captured between WBG operations and the actions of other actors.
The WBG will align with other MDBs and international development
finance agencies on mainstreaming principles and reporting, and with
MDBs and bilaterals on strategies and work programs. The WBG will
strengthen collaboration with leading think tanks, research groups, NGOs,
and business alliance groups (for example, World Resources Institute, We
Mean Business, World Business Council for Sustainable Development,
Tropical Forest Alliance, New Climate Economy, Global Green Growth
Institute, and IPCC), including on coordinated analytical work and country
support. The WBG will build on work already started, to increase collabo-
ration with the International Monetary Fund on fossil fuel subsidies, carbon
pricing, and the fiscal implications of climate change, especially for small
island states.
   The IFC will join international initiatives such as the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development, We Mean Business, and other business
initiatives that mobilize the private sector to move the needle on emission
reductions. The IFC is also convening a joint MDB Task Force on private
investment leveraging that will allow the MDBs to report accurately the finan-
cial impact of their climate action.
   The WBG will also further develop strategic relationships with partners
active in climate finance. It will further include climate considerations in the
GFDRR—for instance on urban resilience. The WBG will work to incorpo-
rate climate considerations in the Global Infrastructure Facility, support the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change processes—as
appropriate—and continue and strengthen country-level and regional part-
nerships. The WBG will build and expand on CIF and MDB partnerships to

52	                               World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
catalyze actions where there are gaps and where the CIF is well positioned to
support the WBG in delivering on its ambitious climate targets.
   The GCF could be a significant partner for co-investment, building pipe-
line, and increasing countries’ readiness for direct access. However there are
still uncertainties at this time. The World Bank and IFC are now both accred-
ited as GCF Implementing Agencies. The GCF has received pledges amount-
ing to $10.3 billion, of which $6.9 billion has been paid in. The GCF is still
hoping to approve projects amounting to $2.5 billion in 2016. It has so far
approved $168 million, and more projects will be approved at the next board
meeting in June 2016. The WBG (and MDBs) have the capacity to deploy
resources at scale and in transformational ways on behalf of the GCF, and
MDBs could be an especially important channel for countries with weak
capacity. The World Bank has started to build a pipeline of projects for the
GCF, with initial proposals pending approval for $86 million. The WBG has
engaged with the GCF more strategically, with early discussions on projects
estimated at $600 million. There is an opportunity for the WBG to provide
readiness support for countries to build institutional capability and move
toward accreditation to enable direct access. The WBG will continue to work
closely with the GCF, trying to develop a strategic programmatic partnership,
but strategic and technical issues would need to be resolved. Expectations will
need to be managed in the medium term.



Global Advocacy on Key Issues
The WBG will advance selected climate issues through focused global advo-
cacy, focusing on issues on which the WBG has an established voice and that
can facilitate large-scale climate action. Such priority topics include carbon
pricing—building on momentum from Paris, the CPLC, and the Carbon
Pricing Panel; fossil fuel subsidy reforms; issues related to inclusion and pov-
erty and the imperative to leave no one behind; integration of climate into
finance for development (including advocating well-targeted and well-­     scaled
blended concessional finance); and increasing private sector capacity and
building private sector markets. Moreover, additional issues will be selected
annually for a special advocacy effort, such as issues related to climate change
and water during 2016. The IFC will contribute to the dialogue through blogs
and articles that share lessons learned.
   This advocacy work will also take place through participation and leader-
ship in key external events, such as the Spring and Annual Meetings, regular
global events such as the World Economic Forum, the Climate Week and
UN General Assembly, G20/G7 meetings, the Climate Action 2016 summit,
COP22, and major thematic meetings such as the World Humanitarian
Summit, Habitat III, and the World Cities Summit.
   The WBG will also support COP22 by assisting the host country and push-
ing forward its clients’ agenda. In particular, it will support the Moroccan
government, as the host and to demonstrate the leadership the country has
shown, with WBG help, on the low-carbon agenda. The WBG will continue

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                  53
its leading role in global advocacy on specific topics (including carbon pric-
ing, renewable energy, and the blue economy). COP22 will be implementa-
tion-focused, with objectives that align with the WBG’s agenda for its clients
and advocacy. In particular, COP22 can support the delivery of new financial
tools that are innovative and able to mobilize private sector flows and unlock
public sector resources; facilitate technology transfers and capacity support
of new and emerging technologies; increase and accelerate the financing of
adaptation; and enhance transparency through, for example, setting up met-
rics for the NDCs. In that framework, the WBG can in particular build on the
Lima-Paris Action Agenda, by creating new and implementing existing coali-
tions and partnerships, including on transport, renewables, adaptation, for-
ests, water, agriculture, and climate security.



Build the Knowledge Base and Create New
Solution Packages
The WBG is a leader in analytical work and data collection on climate-related
issues, has produced major influential reports on climate, and has co-­
developed or shared many global best practices. The WBG has a rich history
of developing and implementing overall standards—notably IFC Performance
Standards, which have become global benchmarks—as well as sector-specific
standards, such as IFC’s EDGE standard for green buildings and Climate
Assessment for Financial Intermediary Investment, which enables financial
intermediary clients to monitor climate results. With its development part-
ners, the WBG has invested in monitoring and evaluation and developing
new metrics to measure the impacts and results of climate policies and
projects. The WBG is actively promoting learning—targeting staff and coun-
­
try counterparts, organizing conferences, and investing massively in new
technologies for training, for instance, through the Open Learning Campus.
   The WBG implements and advocates an “open data” approach, a major
component for evidence-based policies. Open data are particularly important
for DRM and climate change adaptation, considering the need to include risk
information and data in planning and design decisions. The 2016 World
Development Report, Digital Dividends, and the recent Shock Waves reports
emphasize the potential development and resilience gains from better access
to environmental and climate data.
   Going forward, the WBG will improve the design and implementation of
household surveys, to ensure it has the data needed to understand the cli-
mate-related challenges countries face and design better solutions. By 2020,
15 developing countries will have introduced climate-related components in
their household data collection.
   The WBG will maintain thought leadership that contributes and dissemi-
nates key pieces of analytical work, and strengthen knowledge sharing
­
activities. At least four flagship reports on climate change will be published
and disseminated by 2020. Suggested topics include helping countries man-
age the fossil fuel transition; the distributional impacts of climate policies;

54	                              World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
resilient infrastructure; metrics for measuring policy outcomes on resilience
and ­ carbon emissions; migration, climate change, and resilience; climate
change and cities; and climate change, gender, and poverty. The WBG will
also ­continue doing regional and country-level analytical work, as needed,
and produce country-level reports.
    The WBG will also build on its strong track record to develop and roll out
decision support tools and metrics for staff and clients, to help them under-
stand the implications of their own development pathways and improve
policies for low-carbon, climate-resilient development—for example, the
­
IFC’s EDGE, ESMAP’s Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy, and
the Climate Policy Team’s Climate Action for Urban Sustainability Tool. The
WBG will continue ongoing work to define resilience indicators at the project
and national levels, and develop methodologies to measure the outcomes of
­emission-reduction policies.
    The WBG will work in partnership to increase the impact of analytical
 work. In particular, it will partner with NGOs, UN technical agencies, think
 tanks, research centers, and key businesses to leverage and share lessons
 learned, and produce co-branded reports and analyses. It will work within
 international standard-setting groups to bring usable, “science-based stan-
 dards,” and new technology innovations to its clients as they seek to set ambi-
 tious climate targets. It will also participate as an observer at the IPCC and
 contribute staff to future IPCC reports.



Organizational Capability and
Collaboration to Deliver
All WBG units have put in place structures to mainstream climate change
into their activities and operations. The country departments, GPs, and global
industry departments have the responsibility for determining and delivering
operational programs. In the World Bank’s regions, the focal points take the
lead on climate change for the regional strategies. The Regional Leadership
Teams have regular review meetings on climate change priorities and ­ progress.
Most of the World Bank’s GPs have a member of the GP’s Leadership Team
serving as the climate change focal point, and some have dedicated teams
focusing on this issue. The IFC has developed a Climate Business Network
that includes one climate anchor from each industry department and from
each region, advisory, and operational unit.  The IFC’s Climate Business
Department, which is part of the CCSA, coordinates the network, develops
strategy, and provides key centralized support.
   The Climate Change CCSA works with all WBG units to provide targeted,
cross-cutting climate support to clients. The CCSA will continue to develop
innovative solutions that have the potential to be scaled up, and support other
WBG units on cross-cutting, climate-related issues. It will step up its techni-
cal support to operations for lending, analytical work, and mobilization of
private sector climate finance. In collaboration with others in the WBG, the
CCSA helps shape the overall WBG climate strategy. The CCSA will oversee

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                 55
and support the implementation and updating, as needed, of the Climate
Change Action Plan; advance further strategic analysis of climate-related
issues, enabling the optimal use of concessional finance; and promote cross-
WBG interventions. The CCSA is also the interlocutor/spokesperson for the
WBG on cross-cutting global dialogue on climate change issues, working
closely with the GPs, which lead externally on sector-specific climate issues.
The CCSA also leads on relevant corporate functions, including the develop-
ment of indicators, leading the climate theme for IDA, and monitoring IDA
commitments to ensure compliance. The CCSA hosts global climate funds,
including the CIFs, the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program, Forest Funds,
and Carbon Funds, and will lead the efforts to streamline and simplify access
to these funds, and reduce the fragmentation of climate finance.



Align Internal Processes and Incentives
The WBG will align internal processes, metrics, and incentives to support
the implementation of the Action Plan. These processes include Systematic
Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs),
which will consider the risks and opportunities created by climate change and
countries’ climate priorities; project design, which will consider climate risks;
and monitoring indicators, which will include new indicators to help the
WBG track its progress in implementing the Action Plan. The World Bank’s
GPs and regions, World Bank’s Treasury, IFC’s global industry departments,
and MIGA will work together—with the support of the Climate Change
CCSA—to create and fulfill demand for climate change action.
   The WBG will take climate change into account in its country strategies.
The WBG will ensure that SCDs consider available climate information and
data to examine the potential impact of climate change on future poverty
reduction, and adaptation and resilience priorities and needs. Where appro-
priate, SCDs will also take into account the implications of a country’s energy
mix and proposed shifts to a lower-carbon economy, as articulated in the
NDC. The WBG will also ensure that the CPFs addresses climate change
issues and risks as appropriate for each country—in line with current guid-
ance—and include, when and where it is appropriate, NDC priorities and the
multiple available sources of financing to increase the climate-related contri-
butions of WBG-financed projects.
   The WBG will also ensure that its operations take climate change risks into
account. It plans to extend risk screening to IBRD operations in early 2017,
after a review of existing tools and the lessons drawn from application to IDA
countries. The IFC will start screening some sectors after testing and validat-
ing its climate impact risk screening tool; this is expected to be done by
September 2016 and to lay the basis for the IFC’s path forward. The World
Bank will also build gender considerations into its climate screening tools
(FY17), and take stock of lessons learned from the incorporation of gender
issues into climate change considerations and adapt those tools as needed
(FY18). The ongoing work on resilience and “decision making under

56	                                World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan
uncertainty” methodologies will help standardize sector approaches and
reduce the cost and help connect TTLs and investment officers with experts.
   To measure its project impacts, the WBG will continue to roll out GHG
accounting and account for carbon emissions, and resulting risk, in its project
evaluations. It will generalize and formalize project-level economic analysis
with and without a social value for carbon in all World Bank projects subject
to GHG accounting, based on a forthcoming discount rate guidance note. The
IFC will also further explore tools to include carbon risks in the best possible
way in its decision-making process. All WBG buildings-related operations
will conduct an economic analysis on a lifecycle basis and account for energy
and resource efficiency. The World Bank will review by June 2018—and
improve if needed—the “social value of carbon” guidance note, based on new
science and application to World Bank operations.
   The WBG will align incentives rewarding WBG collaboration, external
funds mobilization, and cross-sector operations. To do so, it will develop,
implement, and report new mobilization and catalyzing metrics, and explore
moving from measuring inputs of climate finance to measuring impact and
leverage. In particular, it will review and enhance, as needed, mobilization
metrics for corporate scorecards and memorandums of understanding, to
increase incentives for private sector leverage. The WBG will work to use
WBG financing in a way that builds climate investments without distorting
nascent markets. To facilitate cross-sector operation, it will facilitate shared
budgets across GPs for multi-GP projects, and encourage multisector and
cross IFC–World Bank–MIGA teams in selected high-priority areas.
   Finally, the WBG will strengthen, streamline, and harmonize monitoring,
reporting, and evaluation for climate action (resilience indicators, GHG
accounting, and climate co-benefits) to improve results frameworks, build
capacity, and facilitate evidence-based learning. It will develop new indicators
to track progress (for example, resilience indicators) and apply them to sup-
port policy dialogue (for example, the Readiness for Investment in Sustainable
Energy Index). The WBG continues to track the emissions of investment
lending projects to capture the development impact. The World Bank will
join the IFC in tracking gross emissions and will calculate sector-level gross
emissions-based intensity metrics, allowing the World Bank to track perfor-
mance over time. The World Bank will start reporting annually the net emis-
sion impact, and the IFC will continue to report net emission reductions.
The WBG will harmonize as much as possible its methodologies with those of
the other major development partners.
   Over the next 18 months, the WBG will continue to develop and main-
stream metrics and indicators to measure the outcomes of WBG operations,
and move monitoring and evaluation from inputs to outcomes. However,
the  WBG will avoid creating a bias toward actions that have quantifiable
outcomes versus actions that are essential but difficult to monitor in outcome
­
terms. The outcomes of some of the priority actions under this plan (for
example, toward resilience or through institutional building) are notably
difficult to quantify, but should not be put at a disadvantage by the results
­
framework.

World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan	                                 57
   Going forward, the WBG will increase access to knowledge and data by
all staff. By the end of FY16, it will create a one-stop shop to provide TTLs
with climate information (for example, climate risks and NDCs) and help
TTLs blend climate finance (CIF, GEF, GCF, and others) and use carbon
finance instruments. The IFC already has its Blended Climate Finance Unit to
serve as a one-stop shop, and plans to increase internal knowledge manage-
ment through workshops, webinars, and the integration of climate into its
training weeks.
   The WBG will ensure that its staff—and its counterparts as appropriate—are
trained on the challenges created by climate change. It will develop and roll out
training on climate essentials in the context of the Paris Agreement, with a
focus on NDCs, and include climate change in the WBG staff curriculum. The
target is to provide basic climate change training to all WBG staff by FY18. It
will build a climate change practitioners community of practice among the
1,200+ staff working on climate change across the WBG, and strengthen the
knowledge management system, to collate and share the operational knowl-
edge created and collected by the GPs, IFC, and MIGA. And the WBG will
support the development of client and national stakeholders, including private
sector capacity, to identify and implement priority climate actions, enable
multisector engagements, and create new opportunities for the private sector.
The WBG will also scale up climate change knowledge through a new genera-
tion of innovative capacity-building products, including facilitated e-learning,
Massive Open Online Courses, and learning modules through the World
Bank’s Open Learning Campus.
   Because meeting climate objectives requires innovative and ambitious
measures, this Action Plan will require experimentation, learning, monitor-
ing, and regular revisions. It is to be expected that some of the actions under
this plan—especially the ones involving the development and piloting of new
approaches—will meet unexpected obstacles, while others will deliver more
than is expected. The plan’s results framework aims for 75 percent of the listed
actions having a measurable impact by 2020. This Action Plan is based on a
background note from the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group on
lessons drawn from past action plans, and this collaboration will be main-
tained in the future. The WBG will adjust its strategy as it learns from mis-
takes and successes, supported by progress made on the indicators and
monitoring systems that will be developed over time.

Appendix: Regional Plans and
Integrated WBG Priorities
Africa
In the Africa region, resilience, food security, adaptation, and energy access
need to be significantly improved. Climate-related shocks, such as droughts,
floods, and storm surges, are already severely affecting the region. Food
security is already an important issue in many parts of Africa, and climate
impacts through droughts and yield changes will have significant conse-
quences for food security in the future. In addition, indexes consistently
find adaptation needs to be the highest in the Africa region. On the energy
side, the region has the lowest energy access, with access to non-solid fuels
estimated at about 20 percent of the population, much lower than in other
regions (figure A.1). Furthermore, the region has the lowest carbon emis-
sions per capita.
   From FY11 to FY15, the World Bank Group (WBG) portfolio for climate
funding in Africa focused on mitigation, but there is large scope to scale up
adaptation across sectors. The average climate funding in FY11–FY15 was
around $1.7 billion per year, the share of total financing with climate co-­
benefits being around 17 percent across the period (figure A.2). Most of the
climate funding was on mitigation, mainly on energy and green buildings.
Adaptation efforts focused on agriculture and water, but there is a large poten-
tial in other sectors, particularly urban development.
   Most of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in the region pri-
oritize adaptation. For instance, Niger’s NDC includes sustainable land and
forest management and climate-smart agriculture, with a strong emphasis on
food security, farmers, and pastoralist communities. Moreover, the NDCs in
the region also include mitigation actions. For example, Kenya’s NDC lists

 adaptation to climate change, but also renewable energy, low-carbon trans-
 portation systems, and promotion of climate-smart agriculture.
    Funding needs for adaptation are high in the region, and will increase
 with the magnitude of climate change. The World Bank and United Nations
 Environment Programme estimate that the annual funding needs for Africa’s
 adaptation are about $5 billion to $10 billion for a warming of 2°C, but this
 may increase to $20 billion to $100 billion by mid-century, with 2°C to 4°C of
 warming. Indeed, the importance of adaptation financing in the region is
 exemplified by the relatively high percentage of countries that have estimated
 their financing needs for adaptation in NDCs: 63 percent of the countries in
 the region have an estimate, compared with 27 percent in the rest of the world.
    The World Bank’s Africa Climate Business Plan aims to contribute toward
 filling this gap and raise $16 billion of adaptation investment by 2020. The
 plan, announced at COP21 in Paris, aims to strengthen, power, and enable
 resilience in the region. Around $10.4 billion targets strengthening resilience
 (for example, $1 billion for improved natural resource management, irriga-
 tion, watershed management, and flood protection in the Niger Basin;
 resilience-building activities are ongoing in four cities and about to be
 ­
 ­
 initiated in another five cities; and $3 billion is planned for climate-smart
 agriculture). About $5.4 billion targets powering resilience (for example,
 1  gigawatt (GW) of grid-connected solar photovoltaic and 420 megawatts
 (MW) of hydropower in West Africa, and 150 MW of geothermal capacity),

while about $300 million targets enabling resilience (for example, hydromet
modernization in 15 countries and four regional centers, and the Africa
Climate Resilient Investment Facility).
  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) also expects to grow its cli-
mate investments in Africa. The IFC aims to focus on large-scale renewable
energy, green buildings, and off-grid electricity. Moreover, the IFC is examin-
ing ways to increase adaptation investments in agriculture, which will require
new business models and technical assistance.



East Asia and Pacific
In East Asia and Pacific (EAP), climate change is one of the critical mega-trends
and challenges for the region. The region is expected to be a large and growing
consumer of energy over the next few decades. The region’s generation capacity
is expected to double by 2030, and despite a decline in the share of coal, gener-
ation from coal is expected to increase by 455 GW (figure A.3). Several coun-
tries in the region contain dense forest ecosystems, and forests and landscapes
are a key element of the climate challenge and a major component of climate
policies. In terms of emissions, even without accounting for emissions from
land use change and forestry, the region contributes one-third of global carbon
dioxide emissions. This highlights the immense challenge and opportunity the
region faces as countries continue to develop and urbanize further. The region
also includes some of the most vulnerable areas to c   ­ limate impacts, including
many highly vulnerable small islands. This is a particularly large challenge, as
about 300 million people are still vulnerable to falling back into poverty.

    The region has developed a strong program for climate change, mostly for
 mitigation but with a fast-growing focus on adaptation. Average climate funding
 in FY11–FY15 was about $2 billion per year, with the share of total financing
 with climate co-benefits at about 24 percent across the period ­(figure A.4). There
 is a significant increase in FY16, with the expected share of climate co-benefits
 close to 50 percent. Most of the financing has targeted mitigation, although a
 very significant amount targets adaptation in FY16, with large-scale operations.
    The region is well positioned to continue, scale up, and support NDCs, and
 is therefore on track to meet corporate objectives. EAP’s climate change
 engagement is well-aligned with the NDCs, as the key actions identified in
 the NDCs are consistent with the region’s business line for climate (figure A.5).
 Moving forward, the priorities in the EAP region align well with the NDCs
 and include three main priorities.
    The three main priorities of the EAP region are structured under three
 pillars: (i) climate policy development and improvements in climate-smart
 ­
 planning, financing, and execution; (ii) climate adaptation and resilient devel-
 opment; and (iii) support for low-carbon development. Under the first priority,
 EAP will provide support to the implementation and ramping up of the ambi-
 tion of the NDCs and related financing strategies. EAP will also support coun-
 tries in enhancing the scale and effectiveness of financing toward adaptation,
 including through support for better use of climate information for decision
 making, and improved mobilization of costing and domestic and international

                                financing for climate action. The second priority will focus on integrating
                                adaptation and resilience measures into water, agriculture, energy, urban areas,
                                and transport. EAP will also focus on multisector, area-based adaptation and
                                resilience engagements for climate and Disaster Risk Management (DRM).
                                Third, the region will support low-carbon development: EAP will maintain a
                                strong sustainable energy engagement, with the World Bank at the forefront on
                                sustainable transport; undertake significant forest engagements across the
                                region; and scale up coastal zone resilience and climate-smart agriculture.
                                   The IFC also expects to expand its climate business in the region. The IFC
                                aims to focus on urban infrastructure, including green buildings, waste,
                                energy efficiency and renewable energy (with an emerging focus on South-
                                South business), water efficiency, and green banking. Furthermore, the IFC
                                will build its business in climate-smart agriculture, for instance, through
                                projects on sustainable rice in Cambodia and protein in Mongolia, and
                                ­

                                Many countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region are already
                                facing higher temperatures, changing hydrology, and extreme events—
                                droughts, floods, heat waves, windstorms, and forest fires. Central Asia, the
                                South Caucasus, and the Western Balkans are the most vulnerable hotspots in
                                the region and also the least ready to adapt. The Russian Federation’s boreal
                                forest, which accounts for 20 percent of the world’s forests, is increasingly
                                vulnerable to climate change. ECA is home to 25 percent of the world’s

forests, and forestry and land use patterns have a large influence on carbon
stocks and the global climate. ECA is also the second most urbanized region,
with key infrastructure increasingly at risk. The ECA region contributes
10 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions and is the most ener-
gy-intensive region in the world (figure A.6). High  energy intensity forms
a  constraint to development and reducing it is an opportunity to achieve
­low-carbon growth.

    There is a large opportunity to scale up climate operations in ECA, and
 adaptation needs are growing. The average climate funding in FY11–FY15
 was about $1.4 billion per year, with a share of total financing with climate
 co-benefits of about 18 percent across the period, with activities mainly
 focused on mitigation (figure A.7). Clean energy (energy efficiency and
 renewable energy) dominates the portfolio, with increasing contributions
 from sustainable forest management, natural resource management, and
 advisory services on green growth and climate change.
    Most NDCs in the region focus on mitigation (including agriculture,
 forestry, and other land use), with several NDCs also including adaptation
 ­
 considerations. The NDCs identify large needs related to high energy–­
 intensity industries and power generation, green buildings, and energy
 efficiency. Furthermore, there are opportunities for renewable energy and
 ­
 sustainable cities. The NDCs in Central Asia (Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,
 and Turkmenistan), the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia),
 Eastern Europe (Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine), and Southeast Europe
 (FYR Macedonia and Serbia) also include adaptation considerations. The
 World Bank’s regional engagement includes supporting the NDCs as one of
 its main climate actions.
    Priorities in the ECA region include low-carbon development, climate
 policy and multisector planning, climate adaptation and resilient

development, and fostering collaboration and learning across countries.
Looking ­ forward, the first priority for the ECA region is to tackle high energy
intensity and support sustainable forestry. Second, the ECA region aims to
support climate policy development and multisector planning, integrating
climate resilience into agriculture, water and land resource management, and
DRM. Furthermore, the region aims to foster collaboration, learning, and
sharing across countries to benefit longer-term climate action at the national
level, especially in the most vulnerable regions (including Central Asia, South
Caucasus, and Southeast Europe).
   The IFC has identified opportunities for green buildings, urban infra-
structure, sustainable energy finance, and renewable energy. Turkey has
been the key driver for IFC climate business in the region. Going forward,
Russia and Ukraine could offer the next major opportunities. In addition,
there are opportunities for renewable energy and sustainable cities in South
Caucasus and the Western Balkans, as well as Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, and
Romania.



Latin America and the Caribbean
The Latin America and Caribbean (LCR) region is highly vulnerable to natu-
ral disasters and water scarcity, and faces challenges in land use practices
and sustainable urbanization. LCR is exposed to many climate-related phe-
nomena (glacial retreat, droughts, landslides, hurricanes, and El Niño, see
figure  A.8), which tend to have a disproportionate impact on the poor in
­
urban and rural areas, and especially in the Caribbean. Projections suggest
that climate shocks will become more intense and frequent, further support-
ing the imperative for adaptation and resilience. On mitigation, there is
untapped abatement potential across sectors. In particular, land use practices
from deforestation, forest degradation, and agriculture are responsible for
half of the region’s emissions, and increased reliance on fossil fuels in power
and transport risks raising emissions even further. Yet, there are opportuni-
ties to embed sustainability in urban development (integrated land use,
housing, and transport) in the WBG’s most urbanized region.
­
   The LCR region is a first mover on climate action, especially on mitigation.
The region has pioneered economic instruments to reduce emissions (for
example, carbon taxes) and to provide financial protection from natural
disasters (for example, risk insurance). City sustainability has been enhanced
through a pipeline of strategic and high-impact infrastructure projects in
transport, water, waste management, and buildings. In rural areas, the region
is at the forefront of sustainable forest management. For instance, Brazil
reduced deforestation by 70 percent in 10 years during a period of record
economic growth. The region is also a global leader in attracting and leverag-
ing results-based finance (for example, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility,
and the Carbon Fund).
   Most of the WBG financing for climate projects in LCR has been on miti-
gation, but the pipeline of investments includes low-carbon operations and

                     per year, with a share of projects with climate co-benefits of about 19 percent
                     across the period (figure A.9). For FY16, the pipeline of investments include
                     financing in low-carbon development (especially in energy, environment, and
                     transport) and in boosting social and economic resilience. Furthermore, the

 region has the largest share of climate change and DRM development policy
 financing across the WBG. The region’s transformative programmatic
 approaches include the regional Amazon program, climate-smart cities, and
 regional risk insurance facilities. There is cross-WBG support for green
 growth strategies in Colombia and Mexico.
    NDCs in the LCR region mainly include unconditional pledges, with sup-
 plementary higher-ambition pledges conditional on the availability of exter-
 nal resources. In particular, small states in the Caribbean and Central America
 will continue to rely on external climate finance to meet their NDCs.
    LCR countries draw on the full range of WBG advisory and investment
 instruments for support. The region will continue to provide technical and
 financial support through mitigation, adaptation, and leveraging co-benefits.
 On mitigation, the region will capitalize on LCR’s “clean advantage” through
 sector actions in green energy, waste, transport, and agriculture, and promote
 more sustainable land use in urban areas and natural resources. On adapta-
 tion, the priorities will be landscape planning and investment strategies
 to  (i)  enhance resilience and improve disaster preparedness, (ii) protect
 agri-competitiveness from extreme weather and hydrology change, and
 (iii)  introduce new financial products to boost resilience. On leveraging
 co-benefits, the region will capture all climate-relevant outcomes from policy
 and financing operations across the environment and natural resources,
 industrial, and social sectors.

                     port financial instruments. It plans to grow its portfolio in the region on
                     urban infrastructure, such as green buildings, transport, waste management,
                     energy, water and sanitation, telecom, and social infrastructure. Another
                     priority area is agribusiness, especially in Brazil, the Caribbean, and Central
                     ­
                     America. The IFC will also support financial instruments such as green bonds
                     in the Andean region, Brazil, and the Caribbean.



                     Middle East and North Africa
                     In the Middle East and North Africa (MNA) region, there is potential for
                     increased fragility and water scarcity, and some countries exhibit high emis-
                     sions, mostly those with large energy subsidies. In MNA, many client coun-
                     tries are expected to be significantly affected by climate change, because of
                     reduced water availability (MNA is the most water-stressed region in the
                     world) and heat stress, where extreme summers today could become the aver-
                     age summer in the 2070s. The combined effect of rising temperatures, lower
                     rainfall, and increased evaporation will have major implications for agricul-
                     ture, livelihoods, and food security (figure A.10), with the potential for
                     increased fragility and conflict caused by deteriorating environmental
                     conditions. On the energy side, oil-producing countries have the highest per
                     ­
                     capita emissions in the world and, for many countries, hydrocarbons rep-

 subsidies are in MNA, amounting to 8 percent of regional GDP and 22 ­percent
 of government revenues.
    In recent years, MNA has been ramping up its financing for climate
 projects, particularly on mitigation, but the potential exists to grow the port-
 ­
 folio for adaptation. The average climate funding in FY11–FY15 was about
 $400 million per year, with a share of total financing with climate co-benefits
 of about 11 percent across the period, with activities mainly focused on miti-
 gation (figure A.11). In FY15–FY16, MNA ramped up its climate co-benefits
 by 29 percent, primarily via mitigation in energy, finance and markets, and
 transport. There is also potential to grow the climate co-benefits in agricul-
 ture, environment, water, and urban areas (including green buildings and
 wastewater treatment). In terms of NDCs, the plans submitted by MNA coun-
 tries are often less ambitious than the reforms already underway (for example,
 in the Arab Republic of Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan).
    In the longer term, priorities in MNA include a shift toward clean energy,
 competitive cities, successful Development Policy Loans (DPLs), implemen-
 tation of NDCs, and scale-up of pilots for climate adaptation. One of the
 main priorities in the region is to support the shift toward clean energy in
 power, transport, urban development, and water, and the rationalization of
 energy resources (including regional cooperation on issues such as water).
 Furthermore, urban development is also a priority, with a focus on improving

the competitiveness and resilience of cities, while lowering environmental
footprints. In addition, the region aims to replicate successful DPLs, such as
the Inclusive Green Growth DPL in Morocco. In terms of NDCs, the region
aims to support their implementation, and ensure the level of ambition
is  commensurate with national plans. Finally, the region aims to scale up
pilots on desert ecosystems, and on climate adaptation and resilient develop-
ment for the most vulnerable sectors, in particular water, agriculture, and
ecosystems.
   The IFC also aims to continue to build its renewable energy business and
develop new markets in the region. The IFC’s priorities include growing its
portfolio of green buildings (for instance, in Lebanon), wastewater treatment
and re-use, and clean tech innovation (in Egypt and Morocco). There is also
opportunity for increased sustainable energy finance through financial insti-
tutions, depending on resources for technical assistance.



South Asia
In the South Asia region (SAR), extreme vulnerability is evident through
sea level rise, floods, landslides, and agriculture, and the region exhibits low
energy access in rural areas. World Bank estimates suggest that climate change
could bring 62 million people below the extreme poverty line in the SAR by
2030, mostly caused by agricultural impacts. Hotspot areas with an overlap of
extreme poverty and high vulnerability (for example, to soil salinization in
Bangladesh) already exist in the region. More generally, coastal deltas in the
region are vulnerable to climate change impacts, and current trends in sea
level rise could make parts of highly populated coastal areas uninhabitable in
the future. On the energy side, the energy mix in the region relies on coal;
road transport is expensive, inefficient, and insufficient; and rapid urbaniza-
tion continues to offer opportunities for engagement. Energy access remains
a challenge in the region’s rural areas, offering opportunities for decentralized
renewables and clean cooking (figure A.12).
    Most of the WBG portfolio with climate co-benefits in the region targets
­mitigation, and Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have the portfolios with the larg-
 est climate co-benefits. The average climate funding in FY11–FY15 was about
 $2.6 billion per year, and the share with climate co-benefits was about 28 percent
 across the period, with activities mainly focused on mitigation (figure A.13). In
 FY16, the energy sector dominates in India, water and Social, Urban, Rural and
 Resilience in Bangladesh, and energy and water in Pakistan.
    Transformative action on climate change requires partnerships with
 countries to mobilize additional capital for mitigation and adaptation action.
 ­
 The SAR has identified different priority actions in different countries, with
 an indicative range of financing that can be provided until 2020. On mitiga-
 tion, the priority areas include urban (smart cities and mass transit systems),

                      ities on flood management, coastal management and resilience, and  forest
                      management (table A.2). Priority areas also include climate-smart agriculture
                      and water management.
                         Based on FY11–FY15 trends and the 30 percent increase in financing asso-
                      ciated with climate co-benefits, WBG financing with climate co-benefits in
                      South Asia could be in the range of $13 billion to $16 billion in FY16–FY20.
                      Financing needs for the transformative actions on adaptation and mitigation
                      lie in the range of $35 billion to $65 billion until 2020. This would
                      require an increase in International Development Association/International
                      Bank for Reconstruction and Development resources and/or additional
                      resources in the form of international climate finance.
                         The IFC will focus on sustainable urban infrastructure, such as waste, street
                      lighting, and green buildings, and continue to invest in wind and solar, energy
                      efficiency, and advisory services for scale-up. In agriculture, the IFC is

building a pipeline in solar irrigation, among other areas. Furthermore, the
IFC will look toward South Asia for large “pure play energy efficiency,” while
still developing lines of credit to banks in Bangladesh and India. To scale up
large renewable energy investments, to build the pipeline for sustainable
urban infrastructure, and for adaptation (especially in Bangladesh and Nepal),
the IFC will focus on advisory services.
