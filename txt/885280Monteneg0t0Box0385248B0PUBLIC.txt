I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Montenegro perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Montenegro regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Montenegro;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Montenegro;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Montenegro;
               and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Montenegro.
       Use data to help inform Montenegro country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In April-May 2013, 201 stakeholders of the World Bank in Montenegro were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 110 stakeholders participated in the country survey (55% response
rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via mail or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Montenegro; their overall attitudes toward
the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Montenegro; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Montenegro.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Montenegro: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   Montenegro is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most
   important development priorities in the country, which areas would contribute most to
   reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Montenegro, and how “shared
   prosperity” would be best achieved in Montenegro.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Montenegro, Bank staff preparedness to
   help Montenegro solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Montenegro, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts, and to what extent the Bank
   should seek to influence the global development agenda.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Montenegro, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Montenegro’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-two development areas, such as tourism, public
   sector governance/reform, economic growth, domestic private sector development.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and
   activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its
   technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank’s conditions on its lending
   being reasonable, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Montenegro’s institutional capacity,
   and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Montenegro: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Montenegro’s development in the near future and
   to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank is responsive to information requests, that they find the information on the
   Bank’s websites useful, and that they find the Bank’s websites easy to navigate.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Montenegro, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of consultants/contractors working on Bank-
       supported projects/programs were combined with respondents from project managements
       units (PMUs); respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those from
       multilateral agencies; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs, private
       foundations, and trade unions were combined into a “CSO” category; and the few
       respondents from local government offices, independent government institutions, and
       other organizations were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no
       respondents from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Office
       of a Parliamentarian, CBOs, faith-based groups, or judiciary branches.

Familiarity with the World Bank
         Respondents from the Office of Minister, PMUs, and consultants/contractors working
          on Bank-supported projects/programs indicated the highest levels of familiarity with
          the Bank, whereas respondents from CSOs, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and other
          organizations indicated significantly lower levels of familiarity.
         Respondents across geographic locations indicated statistically similar levels of
          familiarity with the World Bank.
         It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
          significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
          effectiveness, their perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development
          results in Montenegro, and the Bank’s relevance to Montenegro’s development.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in many of these twenty-two development areas in Montenegro (See
        Appendix B for full details). For the most part, respondents from the Office of Minister,
        PMUs, and consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported programs/projects tended
        to give the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness, whereas respondents from the
        CSOs, bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to give significantly lower ratings.
       There were significant differences between geographic locations across two of these
        twenty-two areas. In both instances, respondents from Podgorica had significantly higher
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness than respondents from other regions of Montenegro:
             “Public sector governance/reform”; and
             “Financial markets”.

       Responses across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations can be found in the
        Appendix.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Montenegro, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Montenegro. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Environmental sustainability;
                Job creation/employment;
                Economic growth;
                Health; and
                Poverty reduction.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Montenegro, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Economic growth;
                Job creation/employment;
                Education;
                Environmental sustainability; and
                Energy.

                     departments/implementation agencies indicated that they consult the Bank’s
                     knowledge work and activities weekly.
                    Over a quarter of the respondents from the Office of Minister, PMUs, the
                     media, academia/research institutes/think tanks and the
                     consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported programs/projects
                     indicated that they consult the Bank’s knowledge work and activities monthly.
                    Over a half of the respondents from the Office of Minister and
                     bilateral/multilateral agencies indicated that they consult the Bank’s
                     knowledge work and activities a few times a year.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Montenegro
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement
        regarding the following aspects of the Bank’s work in Montenegro: supporting realistic
        programs and strategies in Montenegro and currently playing a relevant role in
        development in Montenegro. For the most part, respondents from the Office of Minister
        and ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies tended to have the
        highest levels of agreement with these statements, whereas respondents from the private
        sector/ financial sector/private banks and CSOs tended to have significantly lower levels
        of agreement.
       Respondents across all geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with all of these statements.

Overall Perceptions
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement that the
        Bank effectively monitors and evaluates the projects and programs it supports; that the
        Bank provides effective implementation support; where country systems are adequate,
        that the Bank makes appropriate use of them; that the Bank’s approvals and review are
        done in a timely fashion; that the Bank ensures consistency and continuity through staff
        changes; and that the Bank’s conditions on its lending are reasonable. For the most part,
        employees of a ministry/ministerial department/implementation agency and respondents
        from the media had the highest levels of agreement, whereas respondents from CSOs and
        bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with all of these aspects of the World Bank’s operations on the ground.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across five of these
        aspects of the World Bank as an effective development partner: collaboration with the
        Government, follow through over time, straightforwardness and honesty, openness, and
        flexibility in terms of the Bank products and services. For the most part, employees of
        ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies and respondents from the
        media tended to give the highest ratings for these aspects whereas respondents from
        CSOs and bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to give significantly lower ratings (see
        Appendix B for full details).
       There were significant differences across geographic locations in their ratings for the
        Bank’s inclusiveness. Respondents in Podgorica gave significantly lower ratings than
        their counterparts in other regions of Montenegro.
