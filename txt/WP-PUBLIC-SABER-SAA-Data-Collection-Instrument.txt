                   Data Collection Instrument for SABER - School Autonomy and Accountability 2.0


Purpose of the SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability


SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability helps countries to identify the depth and scope of their programs and policies
for school-based management. The SABER-SAA assessment result is a quick but comprehensive review of the enabling
conditions for improved teaching and learning. As such, it allows countries to identify where to focus on improving the
programs and policies that can foster autonomy and accountability, drawing on school and student assessment information.
Countries can use the findings of SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability as a benchmark for tracking their progress in
strengthening school autonomy and accountability policies, as well as for comparing with and learning from other countries.

School autonomy and accountability is one of several domains in The World Bank’s SABER initiative. Information on SABER
can be found at
                                         http://go.worldbank.org/NK2EK7MKV0.
All data produced by this initiative will be available to the public for research and analysis. However, country data will be
reviewed by The World Bank SABER team and the country’s government before information is uploaded to the SABER
website.




Instructions for filling out the questionnaire:
1. Answer every question. In order to answer the questions, highlight the answer with gray color.

2. Provide a justification and reference document for each answer in the space provided next to the answer selected. The
justification and reference provide the evidence to generate country report.

3. The reference documents (policy,laws,legislation, decrees, administrative directives, or any official authorization) are
necessary evidences along with the justifications made in the questionnaire.
4. All questions refer to school autonomy and accountability in primary and secondary schools, both public and private. If
the system of school governance for primary school is different than for secondary school, please fill out two separate
questionnaires and label them accordingly.

5. Use the definitions provided in the attached glossary to fill out the questionnaire. This is important to ensure
comparability across countries.

6. Some questions are written such as Q3i. This "i" means that these questions are for information purpose only and not
related to scoring.

The Human Development Network Education Department of the World Bank developed this Data Collection Instrument. For
