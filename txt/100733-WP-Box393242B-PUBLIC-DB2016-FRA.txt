THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the econom y at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      File a request for a company’s registration with the Centre de
      Formalités des Entreprises (CFE)



      The Centre de Formalités des Entreprises (CFE) handles all formalities
      related to the trade register in the court (RCS, Tribunal de Commerce),
      statistics (INSEE), tax authorities (Centre des Impôts), social security
      (URSSAF), labor (Direction Departemental du Travail et de L’emploi),
      health insurance (Caisse regionale D’assurance Maladie),
      unemployment insurance, pension, Employment Pole (Pole Emploi), and
      similar bodies. This includes the registration of the company bylaws
      with the tax administration.

      Company articles of association and bylaws, lease, attestation of receipt
      of funds, documents concerning the manager, ad hoc forms, evidence
      of publication, and so forth, must be filed in a single file. After receiving
      the request, the CFE must process the documents and transfer them to
      the respective offices and authorities. If the request is incomplete, the
      CFE has 15 days to return the documents for completion. The CFE               1 day on average      EUR 49.92

      automatically enters the information in the Registre Nationale des
      Entreprise (Répertoire SIRENE) and obtains identification numbers from
      the RNE: SIRENE number (Systéme Informatique pour le Répertoire des
      Entreprises), SIRET number (Systéme Informatique pour le Répertoire
      des Etablissements), and NAF number (Nomenclature des Activitees
      Francaises). The SIRET is used, among other things, by the tax
      authorities.

      Since the Dutreil Law, the CFE or the Commercial Registry can deliver a
      receipt for company creation (récepissé de creation d’entreprise) as
      soon as they have received the documents, so that the company can
      start operations without having to wait for its RCS number.

      The principle of electronic company registration was enacted by Law
      2003-721 (August 1, 2003) and implemented under Decree No. 2005-77
      (February 1, 2005). However, a hard copy file is still required. As of
      Decree No. 2006-679 of June 9, 2006, the founder has the option to file
      either with the CFE or directly with the Companies Registry (greffe),

        excluded. However, the founder must register the company's bylaws
        with the tax administration in person.

        Though the CFE does not charge the entrepreneurs for this procedure,
        49.92 euros must be paid at the CFE for the register in the Commercial

        secured procedure has not been clearly defined and the commercial
        court certification is more complicated in that case. It is possible for the
        company to acquire the book later, after it starts operation.

        Obtain an urbanism certificate

        There are two types of an urbanism certificate:
        • Form A informative -- The informative form is a request to only
        establish the existing planning state of a building.
        • Form B operational -- The second is an operational planning
        certificate. In addition to information provided by the
        informative planning certificate, this certificate indicates if the
        land can be used for a project and the existing or planned state
        of public utilities (channels and networks) to serve or serve this
        land.

        A planning certificate is valid for 18 months and can be renewed
        2 months prior to its expiration. The request for a planning
        certificate must be submitted at the City Hall where the lot is
        located using a form Cerfa N° 13410*01. The average time to
        process the operational planning certificate is 2 months. If no
        answer is given within these 2 months, the silent-is-consent rule
        applies.

        construction. The Spinetta Act 78-12 of January 4, 1978                    1 day               EUR 4,117

      Obtain building permit

      To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must submit the following:
      • Location plan (orientation, access roads) and overall plan of the
      construction or renovation (dimensions, elevations, connections,
      access), drawn up on grounds of the Land Registry–based map,
      representing the plot
      • Front elevations
      • Views, cross sections, layout
      • Document with a detailed description of the project impact on
      the existing landscape to prove that it is environmentally friendly
      • Survey photographs (both near- and long-range), allowing for
      the easy identification of the site in relation to the surrounding
      areas

      To prepare this documentation, BuildCo must obtain the building
      permit forms from City Hall or on the Internet through the Booth
      for Forms (Guichet des formulaires) of the Equipment, Transport,
      and Housing Ministry (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports
      et du Logement) (www.equipement.gouv.fr/). Four copies of the
      application are filed at City Hall and a receipt is given in person
      or it may be sent by registered mail with acknowledgement of
      receipt. If one document is missing, claims must be made within
      14 days after registration. Where the application is accompanied
      by all the required documents, the contractor will receive
      acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the date and registration
      number and the time needed for title investigation.                   90 days      EUR 70,113
3
      The building permit will be issued within 3 months after
      registration of the application (except where the plot is a
      classified site). The contractor shall deem the permit tacitly
      granted if no reply is received within the 3 month period. The
      building permit is valid for 2 years. The contractor must begin
      work (or apply for an extension) within that time; otherwise, the
      permit expires. Moreover, if the contractor halts work for over a
      year, the validity of the permit expires, even if the 2-year
      statutory period has not yet elapsed. The permit must be
      displayed at the construction site and must include all the
      requisite information: mandatory dimensions, building permit
      number and date of issue, name of permit holder, nature of the
      work, and the address of City Hall where construction documents
      are open to public scrutiny.

      A copy of the building permit must be available in City Hall for 2
      months to enable any aggrieved third parties (i.e., adjacent
      property owners) to challenge it.

      The application form to connect to sewage is also included when
      requesting a building permit. The application is to the addressed
      to the Sanitation department of Ville de Paris.

      receipt, through a letter signed by the contractor’s company, or
      by the firms that worked on the project -- in which the architect

      Upon receipt of the complete file, ERDF then carries out a technical study
      and sends the customer a connection proposal. This document contains:
      - A description of the technical solution selected, detailing the work that
      the applicant must carry out before the intervention of ERDF,
      - A provisional timetable for the execution of the works,
      - The contacts of an ERDF advisor, which will handle the case
      - The connection agreement, which details the technical, legal and
      financial elements for the connection of the electrical installation and the
      operating rules of this facility.
      - The period of validity of the proposal is 3 months.

      * Receive external inspection by ERDF

      After receiving the application, Electricité Réseau Distribution France
      (ERDF) inspects the site to determine the material needed for the
      external works and final connection, and will send the client either an
2     estimate of the connection fees or the requirements for the connection,        1 calendar day        EUR 0
      both technical and financial.

      Agency: Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF)



      Receive external works from ERDF

      For the works to start, the client needs to pay at least 50% of the
      estimate of fees. Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF) then
      generates an identification number that will be used in all its future
      communications with the client, and especially when the client will
      request the final connection (energization) from their electricity supplier.
      ERDF will also indicate an expected date for the end of the external
      works and, a date after which the service can be energized.

      As soon as the client has received this information, they can contact their
      electricity supplier to prepare the supply contract required for the final
3     connection.                                                                 47 calendar days     EUR 13,413.3

      The connection process might also require works to be done in the
      public or private domain. In this case ERDF will obtain all any necessary
      administrative permits.
      These procedures might cause additional delays in the process, but are
      taken into account in the schedule estimates provided by the utility
      along with the connection requirements.

      Once the works are completed, the client’s private electrical installation
      or site is connected to the public distribution network. The client should
      not wait for the external works to end in order to undertake the
      necessary procedures needed to obtain a conformity certificate of

        Agency: Electricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF)



        * Obtain compliance certificate for internal wiring

        The customer can choose any private electrician for the internal wiring.
        At the end of the works, they will need to request a conformity certificate
        from a control body, such as CONSUEL, that may check the entire
        internal installation to make sure it is conforming to the regulation NF C
        15-100. The type of Consuel certificate needed in this case is an
        "Attestation de conformité "VERTE" ("Locaux à réglementations
        particulières").

        In order to obtain a copy of the form to fill out, the client will need to
        write to CONSUEL (http://www.consuel.com/visa.htm#1). The client will         20 calendar days      EUR 43.59
   4
        need to attach the establishing shot (« plan de situation ») to the
        application. .

        CONSUEL may conduct an inspection based on a risk-assessment
        system. In any case, a certificate will be issued which Electricité Réseau
        Distribution France will check when carrying out the final connection




        Agency: CONSUEL



        Sign supply contract and obtain meter installation and final
        connection

        Once the customer has signed a supply contract with an electricity
        supplier, the latter will request the meter installation and the final
        connection from Electricité Réseau Distribution France on the client’s
        behalf.
        In order to obtain final connection all of the following conditions need to
   5    be satisfied:                                                               4 calendar days         EUR 155.3
        • all the fees have been settled
        • the internal installation is conforming with the regulations
        • the client has completed all the works potentially required from them
        and checked they are conforming with the regulations

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The Seller obtains mandatory environmental reports (3 in total)
       mentioning the presence or absence of termites and asbestos. Without
       these reports the seller would remain liable towards the purchaser if
       termites or asbestos were found in the future. Termites Certificate was
       made mandatory by the Law 99-471 du 8 juin 1999, decrét 2000-613 du
       3 juillet 2000, arreté du 10 aout 2000). Asbestos certificate is mandatory

       l'environnement". It has to be presented on Cerfa and completed by the
       seller. In Paris it is obtained online by the seller's notary. As a result of
       the implementation of the Power Performance Diagnostic (“Diagnostic             15 - 30 days

       code de la construction et de l'habitation, the DPE becomes mandatory
       for any property sold after January 1st, 2011. The seller can be held liable
       later if he does not submit these diagnostics. Additionally, for
       companies, notaries will request the Extrait RCS (Kbis) online in Paris at

      The notary writes to the city mayor to obtain the waiver of the city’s
      preemption rights on the property. The notary informs about the
      transaction and the conditions agreed among the parties. It is common
      that many properties are subject to these requirements, since the
      Municipality may have the right to buy the property at the same price
      that it was agreed on the sale agreement. If the city does not answer in            20 days
      2 months, then the preemption rights have been waived. It may be the            (simultaneous

      co-ownership rules have been published at the land registry more than
      10 years ago. Properties when the whole lot and building are sold will

        The notary can send the documents to the Land Registry immediately
        after the signature of the deed, personally or electronically through
        Tele@ctes. Simultaneously, the notary pays to the Land Registry the
        publicity tax and the salary of the registrar on behalf of the purchaser
        (the value added tax is paid by the company directly). The original deed
        of sale (called the “minutes”) remains with the notary for 75 years.
        The Land Registry will verify the transaction (name and date of birth of
        person should coincide with the Conservation’s records; parcel & section
        catastrale). The transfer of property is opposable to third parties after
        publication of the deed by the land registry office.
        On completion the vendor’s creditors if any, must execute a deed of
        discharge or release of the existing mortgages benefiting to them.

        consistently during 2009. This makes the system faster and reduces the
        chances for errors, because the Conservation employees do not have to
        input information manually into the system. Data is inserted
        electronically into the Fiji system automatically from Teleactes. Land
        registries are proactively inviting notaries to participate in the electronic
        system, with a positive response from notaries.
        At this point, First the notary prepares the acte de vente with its own
        software, prints and has it signed by the parties. Then he inputs the
        information again in a separate screen of Teleactes to submit it to the
        Service de Publicite Fonciere for publication.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

 Indicator     Answer                                          Explanation
                               In France, the legislator stresses preventive procedures that can benefit
                           companies that are not yet in insolvent. But, under the case study assumptions,
                            Mirage is already insolvent because it cannot pay the money owed to BizBank.
                            Therefore, there are two possibilities – other than out-of-court procedures-: (i)
                            ask the opening of a judicial reorganization procedure, (ii) request liquidation.
                           Because Mirage’s management want to continue the company operating, it will
                                          request the opening of reorganization proceedings.

                              and impose a moratorium during the observation period (12 months and
                             exceptionally 18). This would enable Mirage to obtain from Mirage, either a
                           return of the outstanding debt, or more time to repay that would not last more
                          than 10 years. But it is likely that the procedure will be converted to liquidation if
                          Mirage cannot respect the engagements fixed in its reorganization plan or if it is
                                                manifestly impossible to agree on a plan.


                                   If Mirage is liquidated, its activity could be provisionally continued to enable
                                     potential buyers to present offers to maintain all or part of the assets and

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
