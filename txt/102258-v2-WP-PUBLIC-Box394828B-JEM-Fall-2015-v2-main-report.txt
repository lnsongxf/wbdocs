                         BOX 1. Jordan’s Continued Drive to Reform its Water and Energy Sectors


 The energy and water sectors have suffered from structural inefficiencies which have resulted in large and
 unsustainable fiscal costs. Jordan’s historic vulnerability to global fuel prices fluctuations, coupled with the frequent
 interruptions in the import of piped natural gas from Egypt from 2011 onwards prompted Jordan to import more
 expensive diesel and fuel oil. The Government’s initial decision not to pass-through the higher fuel costs to final
 consumers resulted in a significant increase in the National Electricity Power Company’s (NEPCO) operating losses.
 As a result, NEPCO has been running deficits equivalent to around 4-5 percent of GDP per year since 2011 and has
 accumulated total operating losses of about JD4.7 billion by end of 2014, for which debt servicing has until recently
 been directly covered by the budget. On the water front, Jordan has historically grappled with water scarcity and
 is the second most water scarce country in the world1. High subsidies in the water sector result in inefficient use
 of resources. Jordan has become more dependent on non-conventional, and often very energy-intensive, water
 infrastructure causing the water sector to add further budgetary losses equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2014.

 To improve these inefficiencies and to create fiscal space, reforms have been undertaken, in part supported
 by the World Bank. These developments from 2011 and onwards encouraged the Government to develop and
 implement programs to gradually reform its electricity and water subsidies and diversify and reduce the cost of
 energy supply. This was planned to be achieved through the development of domestic renewable energy resources
 and alternate natural gas supply options for power generation, and implementation of water sector reforms that aim
 to optimize the allocation of water resources, while reducing the use of energy in the sector. In order to support
 these reform programs in the water and energy sectors, the World Bank approved a US$250 million loan to finance
 the First Programmatic Energy and Water Sector Reforms Development Policy Loan (DPL) on September 18, 2015.

 The focus of the reforms in the energy and water sectors is to improve the financial viability and increase
 efficiency gains in both sectors. Specific policies in the electricity sector supported by the proposed DPL aim to
 restore the electricity sector to full cost recovery in 2017 through a coordinated program of tariff adjustments and
 cost reduction measures including (i) implementation of a five-year (2013-2017) electricity tariff adjustment plan;
 (ii) development of a floating terminal in the port of Aqaba, which started operation in July 2015, to import Liquefied
 Natural Gas and increase its share fuel supply by more than 70 percent instead of more expensive diesel; and (iii)
 scaling up development domestic renewable energy resources which is expected to reach 10 percent of the power
 generation mix by 2017. The implementation of these DPL-supported policies and achievement of their results could
 yield significant increase in revenues and cost savings totaling JD1.7 billion2 in the electricity sector over the 2015-
 2017 period. On the water sector front, the DPL supports (i) the Government’s plan to reform water tariffs to achieve
 operation and maintenance cost recovery in the water sector by 2017, (ii) enacting a series of water sector policies
 that aim to scale up implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the water sector to achieve annual
 energy efficiency savings of 50 GWh in 2017, and (iii) optimizing the allocation of water resources to increase the
 use of surface water by municipalities and the volume of treated wastewater used for non-domestic consumption.

 Such reforms are expected to result in significant fiscal space. The successful implementation of the reform
 programs in the water and energy sectors will decrease their burden on future government budgets. The resulting
 increase in fiscal space will allow the Government to invest in pro poor programs and other more inclusive programs
 that will improve the standard of living of the population in Jordan. Combined with other reforms in improving the
 business climate and in line with Vision 2025 (Box 3), the economy would achieve a higher growth path.

                                                                                       BOX 2. Output Gap Analysis

     Policy makers are interested in how much spare capacity exists in the economy in order to design appropriate
     economic policies. One way is to estimate the difference between potential output (with fully employed factors of
     production) versus actual output.


     As there are significant uncertainties surrounding output gap estimates, alternative estimation techniques are
     employed. The output gap for Jordan is estimated on annual data over the sample period 1975-2017 as well as on
     quarterly data over the sample period Q1-1992 to Q1-2016. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, a de-trending statistical
     method, is employed using three standard smoothing parameters. To minimize the end-point bias that the HP filter
     is normally susceptible to, the annual sample period is extended through 2017 while the quarter sample period is
     extended through Q1-2016 using World Bank staff projections. The annual output gap is also estimated using a Pro-
     duction Function model (as of 1990), which is a structural method incorporating economic theory that relates output
     to total factor productivity and production inputs.


     The alternative estimation methods yield different magnitudes of the output gap in most periods; neverthe-
     less, the trajectories they generate are highly correlated. From the mid-1990s until mid-2000s, the economy was
     running below its potential and the output gap was widening until 2004, when a high growth period ensued and
     lasted until 2009 (Figure 15). The output gap trajectory reverted in 2004 and by 2009 it had reached 5.43 percent of
     potential output (on average across the four estimation methodologies).


     Since 2013 the economy has been below its potential and the output gap has been widening. The magnitudes
     of the quarterly output gap estimates from the different HP filters are very close (Figure 14). However, depending
     on the smoothing parameter adopted, output in 2014 is estimated at above or below potential. The output gap from
     the HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600, the standard parameter used in the literature for quarterly data, is
     negative in all quarters of 2014. This is in line with the annual data. Output gap further widens to reach -1 percent
     of potential output in the first quarter of 2015 which is the lowest gap since the fourth quarter of 2006. The gap nar-
     rows by the second quarter of 2015 but is still negative at -0.42 percent of potential output. All estimation methods
     reveal that, following the sharp and persistent economic slowdown of 2010, the large positive output gap that existed
     in 2009 starts narrowing, turns negative in 2013 and further widens in 2014 (Figure 15). The output gap estimates
     for 2014 from the different methods range from -0.29 percent to -1.36 percent of potential output with an average
     of -1.01 percent.


     Despite the uncertainty in estimating a country’s output gap, the various estimates shown above all indicate
     that Jordan’s economy is currently operating below its full capacity. This is further reinforced by other capacity
     indicators, such as in the labor market.

    unexpected events. Our baseline takes the view         6.8 to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2015. The trade deficit
    that the H1-2015 underperformance is largely           is estimated to narrow from 25.9 pp in 2014 to 20.6

the twin deficits. This pressure, previously a larger
and significant risk factor, is now being mitigated
as Jordan reduces its oil price exposure via energy
diversification efforts and energy sector reforms
such as NEPCO tariff adjustments. The availability of
external financing is a downside risk given uncertain
global capital market conditions. This pertains to
lower grants expected in 2015 compared to 2014
and to the availability of private sector financing
to support an announced non-US guaranteed
Eurobond transaction in October. While the Federal
Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) September
2015 meeting did not raise interest rates, there are
expectations it could still do so before the end of
the year. Should this materialize, however, it is not
expected that the pass through would be significant
for Jordan, at least not in the short-term. Markets
also expect the FOMC to tighten rates very gradually
and in small increments.

18.	     Structural reforms particularly in energy
diversification and improving the business
climate bode well for medium-term growth
provided Jordan can weather the challenges of
a precarious neighboring security situation. As
such, progress on the energy diversification front is
welcome to reduce Jordan’s dependency on more
expensive and polluting diesel and fuel oils which it
has resorted to since disruptions of natural gas from
Egypt as of 2011. The LNG terminal at Aqaba has
been operational since July 2015 and is expected to
yield savings of JD820 million over the 2015-2017
period.9 As part of its energy strategy, Jordan is
projected to increase its share of natural gas supply
for power generation from 7 percent in 2014 to 70
percent by 2017 and is also expected to build up
the share of renewable power in the generation mix
to 10 percent by 2017. On the business climate
front, the Government has been designing different
initiatives to enhance the business environment by
reviewing procedures and related legislation with
expected implementation in Q4-2015.

                           BOX 3. Jordan 2025: An Economic and Social Development Vision for Jordan

     The Jordanian government launched Vision 2025 “Blueprint”, a new ten-year strategy in May 2015. The vision
     and strategy which includes more than 400 policies and procedures was designed in an extensive consultative process
     involving the private sector and citizens. Implementation of the strategy is expected over three executive development
     plans, with the first for 2016-2018 finalized end-September aligned with the 2016-2018 budget. The strategy
     acknowledges the need for strong partnership among key stakeholders and for its effective implementation. Depending
     on progress achieved, it offers two scenarios with the targeted scenario achieving real growth rates of 7.5 percent by
     2025 with the baseline scenario achieving a 4.8 percent growth rate.

     Vision 2025 places citizens at the heart of the development process, defining its main goal as improving the
     welfare of citizens, with society, business and government as the other three main pillars. Relatedly, it stresses
     improving basic services to citizens, creating a balanced society with opportunities available to all, more equal
     development by bridging gaps between governorates and giving citizens more of a voice. The strategy presents current
     social and economic outcomes across a number of macroeconomic and development indicators such as in health,
     education and employment and social outcomes related to the rule of law, citizenship and poverty, and compares these
     across countries for benchmarking purposes. It also highlights the business environment and government performance
     including in the provision of services and management of resources and presents desired outcomes for indicators for
     each pillar (Refer to Figure 16).

     The strategy is guided by seven core principles. These “principles for collective action” stress the rule of law including
     improving the transparency and accessibility of government information, improving meritocracy by moving away from
     favoritism towards equal opportunity, and promoting a more participatory culture, away from entitlement and to active
     citizenship. Excellence is another embedded principle, setting higher standards to achieve global best practice levels
     across the economy and services. The strategy focuses on improved competitiveness to shift from a small, domestic
     economy to a dynamic regional hub. Sustainability features as a key principle as well, with a focus on achieving
     sustainable and inclusive growth as well shifting towards institutionalized rather than personalized decision making.

     Vision 2025 calls for a transformation of Jordan’s model of development to achieve growth and prosperity based
     on competitiveness and providing more employment opportunities. The strategy identifies priority export markets
     beyond the current regional crisis with a target to become a regional hub for the GCC, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and
     Libya and the farther markets of Turkey and Iran. It also identifies priority clusters to drive growth and create jobs both
     building on existing strengths and identifying opportunities in new clusters based on emerging trends. The clusters
     are grouped in construction and engineering and housing, transportation and logistics, tourism, healthcare and health
     tourism, energy and renewable energy, information technology and innovation, agriculture, educational services, and
     financial services.

         The tech startup ecosystem has distinctive terminology and concepts. One way of understanding the tech aspect of
         startups is that if the Internet did not exist, it is unlikely these companies would exist either. There is no official definition
         of a startup. One proposal suggests that a startup is less than three years old, not gone public or been acquired, has
         no more than 80 employees or revenue that exceeds US$20 million.17 Special spaces have sprung up to serve the
         needs of the startup. Co-working offices have open plans and broadband Internet access. An incubator offers office
         space plus training over a fixed period. Like an incubator, an accelerator provides workspace as well as mentoring and
         funding in exchange for equity in the startup. Funding options are split into early and later stages. Early stage includes
         seed money to build and deploy an initial product. The money could come from the startup founder’s own resources
         or friends and family. Another source are angels, typically successful serial entrepreneurs or early stage venture capital
         funds. Later stage funding comes after the startup has demonstrated commercial potential and often flows in several
         rounds termed Series A for the first, Series B for the second and so on. This is usually provided by venture capital funds
         managed by investment specialists that understand the tech sector and the risks involved; they often play an active
         role in the finances of the startup. Another source of investment is crowd funding. This is carried out through special
         Internet platforms allowing the startup to solicit funding from small investors in exchange for equity.

                            BOX 5. Tech Startup Supporting Policy Program in Lebanon - MIEP


     The Mobile Internet Ecosystem Program was designed as a World Bank lending project to support the development
     of the tech startup ecosystem in Lebanon with focus on mobile internet.

     The objective of the program is to: i) increase local entrepreneurship and innovation, ii) enhance employability for the
     youth, and iii) retain talent in Lebanon. The program will be implemented by the Mobile Innovation Hub (MiHub),
     an NGO owned by the ecosystem stakeholders (eg, academia, private sector, financing, civil society) and where the
     government is present.

     The program has three lines of action to support the ecosystem:
     1.	 Creation of the community of entrepreneurs by developing community building events (eg., meet-ups, workshops,
         trainings, and competitions with acceleration)
     2.	 Strengthening of the tech skills pipeline, working with universities through apprentices programs, middle and high
         schools to introduce tech skills and rapid tech skills training programs (eg coding bootcamps)
     3.	 Introducing innovation in local industries by connecting entrepreneurs with established industries through open
         innovation processes and experimentation labs for new technology testing and prototyping in real industry
         environments.

     These lines of action are dynamic and will be modified or additional actions will be added by the MiHub as required
     by the ecosystem needs.

                                            BOX 6. Local Innovation Hub


 Although there is no common definition of an innovation hub, this concept can be applied to define the evolution
 of collaboration spaces into community managers that coordinate or integrate many of the other functions of
 collaboration spaces such as coworking spaces, maker spaces, fablabs, accelerators, living labs, and urban labs
 (see source below for description of these spaces). Innovation hubs’ main function is to coordinate all actors of the
 ecosystem and help manage the community of tech-innovators and entrepreneurs to grow sustainably. Many of
 these innovation hubs enjoy the participation of the most relevant actors of the technology innovation ecosystem,
 including entrepreneurs, universities, private sector, collaboration spaces, accelerators, incubators, other providers
 of seed capital, community managers, and government — particularly city government. Some of these innovation
 hubs have collaboration spaces in their facilities, such as co-working and maker spaces, while others coordinate
 their functions with those spaces. Typically, these hubs will phase out their other functions when there are enough
 offerings for the community provided by third parties. Examples vary from Ruta N, Medellin (which is part of the
 city government), to NUMA in Paris (which is a grass-root hub built with the community of local entrepreneurs),
 with Forum Virium, Helsinki, as a middle point (a PPP model owned 50 percent by the city and 50 percent by the
 ecosystem’s stakeholders). Citilab, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Waag Society, Amsterdam, and Urban Lab, Barcelona,
 are other examples of innovation hubs. The World Bank designed and implemented the innovation hub model in the
 Lebanon: Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project (see Box above).




includes implementing open innovation processes
with existing industry, labs to experiment with new
technology approaches to industry processes (e.g.,
digital manufacturing), and customized accelerator
programs directed at specific industries (e.g., a
“fintech” accelerator for the finance industry).
Similarly, government can leverage the tech startup
ecosystem by introducing open innovation for service
delivery and competitions for startups to address
public challenges. Municipal governments can act as
catalyzers of a government open innovation policy
by presenting urban challenges and providing testing
facilities and spaces for entrepreneurs. By leveraging
open innovation through municipal governments,
Jordan can expand the entrepreneurship ecosystem
beyond Amman, where it is mostly concentrated
(Box 6).

the level of governorates. The Vector Autoregression
(VAR) methodology has been adopted on panel
data that involves a cross-section of governorates
in Jordan, during the time period Q4 2007 to Q3
2013. We find evidence suggesting that the Syrian
refugees are causing a reduction in the national labor
force participation rate of Jordanians. Preliminary
analysis reveals this could be the result of refugees
willing to work for relatively low wages, causing a
large increase in discouraged Jordanian workers (as
these have a reservation wage that they perceive
cannot be satisfied under the current environment
and therefore prefer to drop out of the labor force
altogether; since these discouraged workers are no
longer searching for jobs, they are not counted in the
rank of the unemployed). Given Jordan’s previously
low labor force participation rate prior to the Syrian
conflict, the recent drop in the participation rate is a
source of concern.
