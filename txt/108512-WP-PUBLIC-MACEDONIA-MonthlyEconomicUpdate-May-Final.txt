         In 2013 FYR Macedonia’s economy has performed well compared to other countries in the
          region.
         Despite some recent REER appreciation, FYR Macedonia’s export price competitiveness
          remains favorable among regional competitors.

FYR Macedonia has performed well compared to other countries in the region according to the latest
SEE6 Regional Economic Report. Construction activities combined with FDI-led export growth enabled
FYR Macedonia to reach – at 3.1 percent - the second highest real GDP growth rate among the SEE6,
only surpassed by Montenegro. FYR Macedonia’s export growth was also the second highest in the
region, and coupled with a fall in imports, helped to narrow the current account deficit to the lowest
level in the SEE6 (-1.9 percent of GDP). Meanwhile, FYR Macedonia’s domestic demand remained
anemic, but momentum looks poised to turn soon, supported by improving credit growth, which was
the highest in the SEE region in 2013. Improving labor market conditions should also help spur
household spending: the decline in FYR Macedonia’s unemployment rate in 2013 was the fastest among
the SEE6, although the rate itself remained exceptionally high (28.8 percent of the labor force).

FYR Macedonia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated slightly over the past 6 months,
but has remained broadly stable in recent years, helping to support export competitiveness and
growth. FYR Macedonia’s CPI-based real Macedonia's currency peg has helped keep its real effective exchange rate stable
