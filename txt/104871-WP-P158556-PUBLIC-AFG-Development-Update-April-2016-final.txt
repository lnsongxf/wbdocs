AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
April 2016
Preface

          The Afghanistan Development Update, which is published twice a year, covers recent
          economic developments and the medium-term outlook for Afghanistan. Each edition
          includes a more in-depth analysis on a specific focus topic. While the lack of high-
          frequency data in the country makes detailed analysis challenging, efforts are made to
          use reliable sources of data as comprehensively as possible. The Afghanistan
          Development Update is intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, the
          donor community, the private sector, and the community of analysts and
          professionals engaged in Afghanistan’s economy.

  Executive summary

               The withdrawal of international security forces since 2014 and continuing political
               uncertainties have resulted in a significant deceleration to economic growth, with
               fiscal pressures increasing as security threats mount. However, to a significant extent,
               Afghanistan has successfully managed the immediate challenges resulting from the
               Transition. It has maintained macroeconomic stability and established the conditions
               for a slow recovery of the economy. Risks to the economy remain significant, and it
               is vital that the Government identify new sources of growth to replace the declining
               donor inflows over the longer-term.

               In 2015, Afghanistan recorded an estimated economic growth rate of 1.5 percent, a
               marginal increase from the figure of 1.3 percent recorded in 2014. Overall growth was
               largely driven by growth in the industry (1.4 percent) and services (2.8 percent)
               sectors, offsetting the contraction in the agriculture sector (-2 percent). There was a
               slight recovery in the level of investment after several years of decline, with the
               number of new business registrations increasing slightly over the year. However, the
               number of these registrations is still significantly lower than the figures recorded in
               2012-2013, with security challenges continuing to constrain investment. In 2015,
               consumer price inflation dropped to -1.5 percent, down from the figure of 4.5 percent
               recorded in 2014. This decline was primarily due to a decline in the level of private
               consumption and to low global commodity prices.

               As a result of reforms to both revenue collection and expenditure, the fiscal position
               improved significantly over the year. Domestic revenues increased to 10.4 percent of
               GDP in 2015, significantly higher than the figure of 8.7 percent recorded in 2014.
               This increase was largely the result of improvements in the area of tax policy reforms,
               arrears collection, and administration. The Government has also continued to manage
               expenditures carefully, with total expenditures increasing only marginally over the
               year, from 26.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 27 percent in 2015.

               The Afghani depreciated by 7 percent against the US dollar in 2015. This decline was
               driven by the decline in aid inflows, an increasing preference among consumers to
               retain their savings in US dollar and – possibly – capital outflows associated with out-
               migration.

               With the population growth rate estimated to stand at 3 percent per year, sluggish
               GDP growth and the deteriorating security situation resulted in increases to poverty,
               with the poverty rate increasing from 35.8 percent in 2011-12 to 39.1 percent in 2013-
               14. The increase in poverty also reflects the limited number of employment
               opportunities. The estimated unemployment rate almost tripled in the period from
               2011-12 to 2013-14, reaching a staggering 22.6 percent of the labor force in 2013-14.
               Increasing poverty, a decrease in employment opportunities, and the deteriorating
               security situation have been the main drivers of increased out-migration.

               The medium-term outlook points towards a slow recovery over the next three years.
               The rate of growth is projected to reach 1.9 percent in 2016, assuming adjustments in
               firms and households’ behavior in the context of the deteriorating security

               3.6 percent in 2018, if the political situation stabilizes and planned reforms are
               successfully implemented. On the other hand, any deterioration in the security
               environment could weaken growth prospects, with this risk being the most significant
               faced by the country.

  A. Recent Economic Development

                   1. Background

The political and             During 2015, the new National Unity Government (NUG) advanced an ambitious
security context              reform agenda that focused on combating pervasive corruption, strengthening
continues to shape            political and economic relationships with neighboring countries, and restoring peace.
Afghanistan’s                 However, progress has been impeded by increasingly intense security challenges,
economic and social           including emerging threats from ISIS and an increasing number of attacks by the
development                   Taliban following a change in its leadership.

                              These security challenges pose critical threats to personal safety, the delivery of public
                              services, and private investment. In 2015, the number of civilian casualties reached
                              record levels, with the situation having continued to worsen since 2012. The
                              deterioration in the security situation and the lack of sufficient employment
                              opportunities have driven increased levels of emigration. In particular, in 2015, the
                              number of first-time Afghan asylum seekers in EU-28 member states more than
                              quadrupled, with Afghans now constituting the second largest group of asylum
                              seekers in Europe after Syrians. However, Pakistan and Iran remain the host countries
                              for the majority of Afghan refugees, with the combined total number of refugees in
                              these countries amounting to 2.5 million.

                   2. Real Sector Activity

Insecurity continues          Economic growth has remained slow since the withdrawal of international security
to weigh heavily on           forces. The rate of real GDP growth increased marginally over the year, from 1.3
growth and                    percent in 2014 to an estimated 1.5 percent in 2015. However, this is still dramatically
investment                    lower than the average rate of 6.8 percent recorded in the preceding five years.
                              Domestic demand remains weak, growing by an estimated 1.8 percent in 2015, as
                              compared to the average annual growth rate of 7 percent in the preceding five years.
                              Business and consumer confidence levels remain subdued as a result of the persistent
                              political uncertainty, with no signs of recovery in private consumption or investment.

Agriculture                    In 2015, agricultural production declined by an estimated 2 percent. Preliminary
production declined,           estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) show that
particularly due to            the volume of production of cereals (including wheat) declined by around 14 percent.
lower cereals output           The area of land cultivated for rain-fed wheat declined by around one-third, largely
                               due to the lower levels of rainfall recorded throughout the country. Given that
                               approximately one third of Afghanistan’s overall wheat production is rain fed, output
                               is highly sensitive to weather shocks. The output from horticulture, including fruit
                               production, is estimated to have increased, despite drier conditions.

Opium production               The latest survey by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
declined in 2015               estimates that in 2015, the volume of production of opium stood at 3,300 tons, while
                               the area under poppy cultivation stood at 183,000 hectares. A major change in the
                               survey methodology makes a comparison with previous years difficult. However, it
                               appears that both the area under cultivation and the volume of production declined
                               in 2015. This was partly due to lower yields in the Southern and Western regions and

                         two years of a high level of production.1 The reduction in area under cultivation may
                         also reflect several years of crop failures in desert areas, with farmers relocating
                         production to these areas over recent years to avoid more strongly enforced opium
                         bans in the well-irrigated, central areas.2

                         population growth rate.4 It also reflects the limited number of available employment
                         opportunities, with the unemployment rate estimated to have almost tripled in the
                         period from 2011-12 to 2013-14, to reach the staggering figure of 22.6 percent of the

Inflation slipped into In 2015, the consumer price inflation rate declined to −1.5 percent (period average)
negative territory     from the rate of 4.6 percent recorded in 2014, with this decline driven by the fall in
                       global commodity prices and weak domestic demand. The exchange rate depreciation
                       was insufficient to offset the deflationary impacts of lower world prices for grains and
                       energy, with grains declining by 14 percent and energy by 41 percent over the year.
                       The total value of imports amounts to around 40 percent of GDP, and thus global
                       prices tend to have a significant impact on domestic prices.

Deflationary             Food consumer prices fell by 1.9 percent and non-food consumer prices by 1.2
pressures were           percent (period average). Specifically, the prices of vegetables, which constitute the

                     passing through Afghanistan’s airspace. The implementation of these new measures
                     generated revenues of approximately Af 5 billion. An additional sum of Af 8.8 billion
                     of tax arrears was collected,6 including around 2 billion of tax arrears from state-
                     owned enterprises. After discounting the effects of the depreciation in the exchange
                     rate (Af 2.8 billion); of the nominal growth of the economy, including real economic
                     growth and inflation (Af 1.8 billion); and of tariff increases (Af 1.2 billion), Af 2.5
                     billion (or 11 percent of the total value of the revenue increase) can be attributed to
                     the improvements in tax and customs administration.

Expenditures         As a proportion of GDP, the total value of expenditures increased from 26.2 percent
slightly increased   in 2014 to 27 percent in 2015, with the increase in nominal terms standing at 6
driven by higher     percent. Increases to the recurrent security and discretionary development budget
security and         expenditure accounted for the slight overall increase. While recurrent security
discretionary        expenditure increased from 11.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 12.2 percent in 2015,
development          recurrent civilian expenditure declined slightly from 7.9 percent in 2014 to 7.8
spending             percent in 2015. Lower recurrent civilian spending was partially due to a 2 percent
                     cut in allotments, and partially due to delays in budget execution. Nevertheless, this
                     had a pro-cyclical impact, which weakened domestic demand at a time of a
                     deceleration in economic growth. The operations and maintenance costs for civilian
                     assets are already severely under-budgeted in Afghanistan due to the increasingly
                     tight fiscal space. Any further expenditure cuts have the potential to hinder core
                     service delivery.

                        development budget, which also included payments of arrears of about Af 7 billion.
                        The execution of the non-discretionary development budget did not improve in
                        2015. While there have been significant improvements in the areas of budget
                        preparation and payment processing over the past decade, the limited capacities of
                        line ministries in the areas of financial planning and procurement continued to
                        impede execution.

                        accrual approach, the cash-based accounting system records receivables and
                        expenditures at the time when they are actually received and paid. These can occur
                        with some delays with respect to the time of commitments/obligations. Since there
                        is often a time lag between donor grant commitments and the actual receipt of the
                        associated funds, the budget could show a deficit towards the end of the year before
                        fiscal accounts are closed.

Official exports have    In 2015, the total value of official exports stood at about US$ 550 million, a decline
dropped                  from the figure of US$ 620 million recorded in 2014. In particular, the value of
                         exports of dried fruits, fresh fruits, animal by-products (such as skins and wool) and
                         cotton declined, while that of medicinal plants and carpets increased. The decline in

                         levels of agricultural production in the preceding year, reflects the impact of binding
                         structural constraints. Specifically, these constraints include poor infrastructure,
                         limited access to finance, and, most significantly, the deteriorating security
                         environment.

                                in 2015. As in previous years, the trade deficit has been financed by foreign aid and
                                remittances. The improvement in the balance of trade offset the decline in aid inflows,
                                driving a current account surplus of a value of 5.5 percent of GDP.

The exchange rate               In 2015, the value of the Afghani depreciated by 7 percent against the US dollar
depreciated by                  (period average). A comparison of the end-on-year rates (December 2015 compared
around 7 percent                to December 2014) shows a depreciation of around 15 percent. This depreciation
                                reflects: (i) a decline in foreign exchange inflows associated with the decline in foreign
                                aid (security and civilian); (ii) a decline in foreign direct investment and associated
                                capital inflows; (iii) an increased tendency for households to hold their savings in US
                                dollar; and: (iv) possibly, capital outflows associated with the increased levels of
                                outward migration.

Foreign exchange                                           Gross international reserves declined to US$ 6.9 billion by December 2015, down
reserves declined                                          from US$ 7.4 billion recorded in December 2014. However, this level is still
slightly but remain at                                     comfortable, at around 8 months of import cover. The decline in these reserves is
a comfortable level,                                       mainly the result of currency depreciation over 2015, which resulted in an increase to
equivalent to eight                                        the import bill without triggering any offsetting increase in exports. The decline was

                                                           However, the decline in the value of aid inflows is expected to continue over the

                                                           recorded in the same month in 2014, it remains significantly lower than the double

B. Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
Growth in 2016 will            In 2016, real GDP growth is projected to reach 1.9 percent. At this level, it would
remain sluggish                mark the third consecutive year for which Afghanistan has recorded a rate below 2
                               percent. While business and consumer confidence remain weak, private investment is
                               expected to remain stable as firms adjust to the new economic environment. In 2016,
                               the rate of inflation is expected to rebound to around 3 percent, with the depreciation
                               in the exchange rate over 2015 exerting upward pressure on domestic prices. While
                               the exchange rate is expected to remain roughly stable from this point, the
                               depreciation in the value of the Afghani over the past year has been sufficiently high
                               to result in a depreciation of 11 percent to the period average for 2016.

Fiscal pressures will          If the authorities continue with their efforts to improve the performance of revenue

                               nominal terms to reach 10.7 percent of GDP in 2016. With total expenditures
                               projected to increase by a value of 2 percent of GDP (including carried forward
                               expenditures from the previous year), the overall deficit is expected to narrow to
                               about US$ 130 million, or around 0.7 percent of GDP. On-budget donor grants are
                               expected to increase to 17.9 percent of GDP in 2016, up from the figure of 15.4
                               percent recorded in 2015.

Post-transition                Economic growth is projected to increase to 2.9 percent in 2017 and to 3.6 percent
recovery is expected           in 2018. However, these increases are conditional on improvements to the security

The output gap is               Projections for the output gap in Afghanistan show that as the economy slows down,
widening                        this gap will widen over the next three years. This implies that economic resources
                                will remain underutilized. Security challenges are expected to remain significant in the
                                medium-term, with these challenges likely to act as constraints on the efficient use of
                                resources (capital and labor). Thus, the output gap is projected to increase from -2.1
                                percent in 2015 to -7.1 percent by 2018 (see Box 1).

Box 1: Output gap is projected to increase over the medium-term
     The output gap is a measure of the difference between the actual output of an economy (usually measured in terms
of GDP) and its long-term potential output. The potential output is the maximum amount of goods and services that
could be produced when an economy utilizes its full production capacity. Full capacity is achieved when all resources
(including labor and capital) are fully utilized. While labor and capital are the two principal factors of production,
improvements to technology may also have a positive impact on growth, as they determine how efficiently the labor
and capital are utilized in the production process. Hence, a third element is total factor productivity (TFP) growth, which
captures the portion of economic growth that cannot be explained in terms of improvements to the utilization of
capital and labor.
     The output gap can be positive or negative. If demand increases to a level in excess of potential output, then
demand exceeds supply and the output gap is positive. In these circumstances, capacity constraints begin to bind and
inflationary pressures typically intensify. On the other hand, if the output gap is negative, resources are under-utilized
and inflationary pressures subside. Normally, actual GDP (growth) will fluctuate around its estimated potential (growth)
path.
      The output gap is an important measure for policymaking, as it is not only an indicator for how inflationary
pressures build in the economy, but also for how the unemployment gap evolves. If the economy produces at its maximum
level – with actual output equaling the potential output – all resources will be fully utilized and the economy will move
towards full employment. Nonetheless, some level of unemployment – which economists call non-accelerating inflation
rate of unemployment (NAIRU) – will persist in the economy.

provides a basis for improvements to institutional capital (better governance, enhanced administration, etc.),
technological progress, and/or improvements in economic efficiency to materialize. While TFP’s contribution to
projected potential output in the period from 2016-2018 is expected to be null, the widening output gap over the next
few years primarily points towards the underutilization of labor and capital. Thus, in the absence of an economic
stimulus, such as through tax cuts or a substantial increase in public spending, the unemployment gap is likely to
increase and an increasing number of workers will be under-employed. However, any economic stimulus needs to

The medium-term           The fragile political and security environment has constrained private investment and
growth outlook is         growth to a significant extent. Economic crime and systemic corruption have also
subject to serious        often undermined progress towards the achievement of Afghanistan’s governance
risks, which will         and state-building agenda. Therefore, significant improvements will depend on the
need to be carefully      degree to which Afghanistan achieves peace, stability, and reconciliation. Poor and
managed                   vulnerable households are subject to an increasing degree of risk as a result of a
                          number of factors. Firstly, the sharp decline in growth in the period from 2013 to
                          2015 has exacerbated underemployment and therefore resulted in lower levels of
                          consumption across the board. Secondly, although the agriculture sector recorded
                          excellent performance in 2012 (growing by 18.2 percent), the rate of growth in the
                          sector in 2013–14 remained relatively flat, with unfavorable weather conditions
                          resulting in a decline in output in 2015. In the medium term, Afghanistan faces
                          challenges related to the declining level of aid and a demographic youth bulge. With
                          these challenges, the achievement of significant further poverty reduction will require
                          progress in a number of areas, including accelerated overall growth; an increase in
                          productivity in the agriculture sector; a reduction in underemployment; measures to
                          mitigate the impact of climactic shocks; and measures to address regional disparities.

Agriculture and           The agriculture and services sectors are likely to be significant drivers of economic
mining offer large        growth in the future. Agriculture accounts for about a quarter of GDP and is also
growth potential          closely linked to other economic sectors, including the food and beverages sub-sector
                          (which accounts for almost all of manufacturing) and a range of activities in the
                          transport and retail sectors. At present, exports are heavily dependent on agricultural
                          outputs. Afghanistan has the potential to increase its output of fruits, nuts and
                          vegetables and to develop supply chains for higher value-added products. However,
                          the development of these supply chains will require investments to develop and
                          improve irrigation and extension services and to build downstream agro-processing
                          capacities. In addition, there is also a significant potential to develop extractive
                          industries, which currently contribute to a very small share of GDP. Unlocking this
                          potential will require progress to develop the legislative framework and re-
                          engagement with potential investors.

Budget expenditures       Total budget expenditures are projected to increase from a value of 27 percent of

with higher security      spending previously undertaken directly by international partners being moved on
spending and              budget. Afghanistan also faces considerable public expenditure needs to improve
growing pressures on      service delivery; to build essential infrastructure; and to conduct operations and
O&M needs and             maintenance. The achievement of goals related to improving service delivery will
social transfers          require increased public expenditure in the social sectors. Developing new sources of

development              investment program nor integrated with the annual budget cycle. The capital budget

 Box 2: The National Unity Government has launched a Jobs for Peace initiative to address the jobs crisis
  Jobs for Peace Initiative: Stimulate aggregate demand and job creation through a 24-30 month job focused stimulus
  which will provide short-term labor intensive employment in rural and urban areas.
  Target Group           1. Vulnerable families and the poor
                         2. Job Seekers
                         3. Conflict Affected Groups
                         4. Returnees and IDPs
  Proposal                   1.   Rehabilitating Agriculture Infrastructure: Providing block grants to Community
                                  Development Councils (CDC) to rehabilitate agricultural infrastructure, in particular water
                                  resource management, and field leveling. Estimate cost to cover 15,000 communities is
                                  approximately US$ 350 million.
                             2.   Labor-Intensive Urban Cleanup and Repair: Providing small block grants for urban
                                  committees to provide labor-intensive cleanup, drainage, and re-greening programs in poor
                                  urban neighborhoods. Total costs are approximately US$ 200 million.
                             3.   Fortifying Urban Peripheries: Setting up a civilian conservation corps to plant trees, form
                                  parks and patrol the mountains around all of Afghanistan’s large cities to employ large
                                  numbers of at risk youth. Preliminary estimated cost US$ 80 million.
                             4.   Micro-grants for Female Heads of Households: Female head of households, would be
                                  given employment maintaining community public infrastructure. Market-based purchasing
                                  to increase demand for high labor content products produced will be included. Estimated
                                  cost US$ 50 million.
                             5.   Housing Finance: The program’s overall objective is to produce 200,000 units of
                                  affordable housing for returning refugees, with partial financing coming from non-
                                  traditional donors providing parallel funds. Total cost is US$ 500 million.
                             6.   Cash transfers against stunting and malnutrition: This program would provide a cash
                                  transfer and a health packet or (in urban areas) food vouchers for providing nutrition to
                                  stunted or malnourished children. Costs yet to be estimated .
                             7.   Rebuilding the Civil Service: Under this program, the Government would work with
                                  international specialists to package out poor performers and offer quality entry training to
                                  new recruits. Budget yet to be estimated.
                             8.   Voucher Systems for Refugee Return and Reintegration: Under this program,
                                  returning refugees would be given a voucher that can only be cashed by a host community
                                  development council on the basis of an agreement to absorb the refugee or IDP. Budgets
                                  allocations would be of approximately US$ 200/refugee.
  Implementation             Step One: Scale up existing programs that has job creation potential.
                             Step Two: Address implementation bottlenecks of the on-going projects
                             Step three: Mobilize funds in Trust Fund Programs
                             Step Four: Prioritize 2-3 programs

C. Focus Section: Revenue Potential in Afghanistan
                              Since the end of the conflict in 2001, domestic revenues in Afghanistan have increased
                              fourfold in proportion to GDP. This increase is largely the result of significant
                              improvements in the tax code and of the successful efforts to modernize the revenue
                              and customs administration. However, Afghanistan still collects significantly lower
                              levels of revenue than most South Asian and Central Asian countries and low-income,
                              fragile countries around the world. Domestic revenues are still significantly lower than
                              the Government needs to cover its expenditures and to invest in development.
                              Decreasing the level of dependence on external support will require concerted efforts
                              to mobilize revenue. But how much can the Government expect to collect? What is
                              the potential to achieve higher levels of revenue mobilization by improving tax policy
                              and compliance?

                              Different countries record widely varying levels of performance in the area of revenue
                              collection. These differences are visible both across and within regions and income
                              levels. The empirical literature shows that the level of revenue collection is determined
                              by countries’ economic, demographic and institutional characteristics. For instance,
                              countries in which the agriculture sector contributes to a larger proportion of GDP
                              tend to collect lower levels of revenue, because the taxable income and/or
                              transactions is lower in the agriculture sector than in other sectors. Similarly, import
                              levels, trade openness, industrial development, financial depth, size of the extractives
                              sector, age dependency ratios, and the extent of urbanization are all significant factors
                              in determining how much revenue a country can collect. Finally, the quality of
                              institutions also plays an important role, both in determining the effectiveness of
                              government revenue agencies and in determining levels of compliance, with countries
                              with weaker rule of law and higher levels of corruption facing more significant
                              challenges in the area of revenue collection.

                              A country’s revenue potential can be estimated on the basis of a comparison with
                              other countries, taking into account and controlling for differences in the

 Box 3: Definition and measures of revenue potential
      A country’s revenue performance can be measured in either absolute or relative terms. In absolute terms, the ratio
 of actual revenues to GDP (also called tax/revenue effort) is the single best indicator of revenue performance.
       However, relative revenue performance is measured in relation to the revenue potential. “Revenue potential,” or
 “taxable capacity,” is the amount of revenues that a country should collect given its macroeconomic, demographic and
 institutional characteristics. Hence, the relative tax/revenue effort is defined as the ratio between actual and potential
 revenues.
       The literature also distinguishes between “economic” and “legal” revenue potential. The economic revenue potential
 refers to how much the country can collect given its inherent economic capacity; while the legal revenue potential refers
 to how much revenues can be collected with the prevailing tax regime.
     The difference between economic revenue potential and actual revenues is called revenue space, and the difference
 between legal revenue potential and actual revenues is called revenue gap.

                           stand at about 5 percent of GDP.

                           Afghanistan’s revenue potential has evolved over time in Afghanistan. As shown in
                           Figure 19, as revenues increased in the period from 2003 to 2011, the revenue space
                           narrowed. This means that the Government seized more opportunities for revenue

               collection. However, the revenue gap and revenue space has since widened. A number
               of factors may explain this widening, including a deterioration in levels of compliance,
               potentially linked to a weakening of governance in the context of the security
               transition.
               What would it take to close the revenue space?
               A number of structural deficiencies in Afghanistan’s revenue administration currently
               limit the level of tax mobilization. These include deficiencies related to a narrow tax
               base, low compliance rates, low levels of efficiency in the areas of tax administration
               and management, and the large number of exemptions and deductions. These are
               exacerbated by weak institutional capacities. To improve revenue mobilization, a
               number of measures could be implemented, including the following:
                  The introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) to broaden the tax base:
                     Analysis shows that the introduction of a 10-percent VAT could generate
                     revenues to a value of around US$ 350 million in the first year of roll-out, with
                     this value projected to increase to US$ 1.6 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP, by
                     2030. The VAT was expected to be implemented in 2014, but it has since been
                     delayed.
                  The implementation of tax administration reforms to improve revenue
                     collection: The Afghanistan Revenue Department is working to implement a
                     new set of reforms to improve revenue collection, with these reforms including
                     the introduction of e-filing and e-payment of taxes; enhancing the audit
                     function; improving reporting lines and tax payer services; and modernizing the
                     IT infrastructure and HR management. In the medium term, a number of
                     measures, including integrating the Afghanistan Revenue Department and the
                     Provincial Tax Offices into a single national revenue body; re-organizing tax
                     administration according to a functional model; and granting this administration
                     semi-autonomous powers in the areas of human resource and budgeting, could
                     result in further improvements to the performance of revenue administration.
                  Improvements to the operational performance of the Afghanistan
                     Customs Department (ACD): While substantial gains have been achieved in
                     the area of customs administration over the years, a number of factors, including
                     a limited customs infrastructure; difficult border controls; low capacity at
                     customs; and political economy factors, still inhibit the ACD’s revenue
                     generation potential. Further improvements in the areas of entity management;
                     declaration processing; risk management and inspections could improve this
                     potential. Improvements in the level of operational performance of the ACD
                     could shrink the current compliance and revenue gap by increasing revenue and
                     by generating efficiency gains. In the short term, the ACD could benefit by
                     developing a risk matrix to balance revenue collection, trade facilitation and
                     enforcement.
               Moving beyond potential
               With Afghanistan’s long-term financing needs, a revenue potential of 17 percent of
               GDP seems grossly inadequate. In 2014, total core expenditures amounted to about
               26 percent of GDP, with these projected to increase to 36 percent of GDP by 2020.
               This is more than double the value of the estimated revenue potential. The large gap
               between expenditure and potential revenue reflects both exceptionally high
               expenditures, due to elevated security needs, and also various economic, demographic
               and institutional features of the Afghan economy that constrain revenue potential.
               For instance, Afghanistan remains heavily dependent on agriculture, a sector in which

                                                                                                    19

               taxable transactions are limited and compliance is difficult to enforce, with the
               country yet to develop a more easily taxable manufacturing sector. Similarly,
               Afghanistan is ranked among the top five countries in the world in terms of its age
               dependency ratio, with nearly as many people inactive as active within the Afghanistan
               economy. Age dependency is the ratio of those typically not in the labor force (the
               dependent part) and those typically in the labor force (the productive part), and this
               is used to measure the pressure on productive population of those typically inactive.
               This demographic pattern results in lower levels of economic activity and thus lower
               taxable income. Therefore, concerted efforts are needed to increase revenues beyond
               the current potential of 17 percent of GDP to unleash new sources of growth that
               could yield high revenues.

               Two important structural transformations offer good prospects to improve
               Afghanistan’s revenue potential. Firstly, the development of value chains could be
               expected to increase this potential. Economies with a greater proportion of firms
               operating higher up the value chain benefit from a greater number of taxable
               transactions, higher levels of productivity (generating greater revenues as sales,
               salaries and profits), and typically a larger proportion of firms within the formal sector
               and therefore included in the tax base. In Afghanistan, progress in this direction could
               begin with measures to encourage the development of agriculture-based processing
               industries, such as fruit juice production, food processing industries and carpet
               production. The development of these industries would facilitate the transformation
               of agricultural commodities into higher value-added products. Secondly, given
               Afghanistan’s extensive mining potential, it should implement measures to develop
               the mining and extractives sector. With the right policy and regulatory framework, the
               development of the mining sector could provide a substantial boost to revenues from
               the collection of royalties and taxes and from the indirect impacts of this development
               on other sectors, such as construction and services.

               Nevertheless, while Afghanistan has viable prospects to increase revenue collection
               in the long run, it would be unrealistic to expect that even if this potential is realized
               in all sectors, it will be able to match the current level of public expenditures, which
               are expected to reach 36 percent of GDP by 2020. Therefore, it is vital that the
               Government focuses not just on improving revenues, but also on expenditure
               consolidation, especially in the security sector. The achievement of this goal remains
               a critical challenge for the achievement of fiscal sustainability.

APPENDIX: WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN


1. The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
   FY 2012–FY 2014, which focuses on three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of institutions;
   (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs. The process for preparing the next country
   strategy—the Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistan (CPF)—has been launched, and the
   Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) which informs the CPF by identifying the development challenges
   and opportunities has been completed.
2. Since 2002, the International Development Association (IDA) has committed a total of US$ 3.60 billion in
   grants (86 percent) and credits (14 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty seven development and emergency-
   reconstruction projects and a budget support operation have been committed as of March 2016. In
   addition, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$ 8.94 billion of funding
   from 34 donors, and committed US$ 3.93 billion for the Government’s recurrent costs and US$ 4.15 billion
   for government investment programs. As of end February 2016, the active IDA portfolio was worth US$
   1.27 billion and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth US$ 2.8 billion.
3. The Bank also administers the ARTF—the World Bank Group’s largest single-country multi-donor trust
   fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling financing strategy.
   Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$ 1 billion per year in grant resources (about US$
   150 million from IDA and about US$ 800–US$ 900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle
   for providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing and provides a
   platform for policy dialogue between Government and donors.
4.   In FY 2016, the World Bank Board approved the Trans-Hindukush Road Connectivity Project in the
     amount of US$ 250 million, as well as additional financing for an existing project—the Second Customs
     Reform and Trade Facilitation Project—in the amount of US$ 21.5 million. Under the ARTF, three new
     projects were approved including US$ 83 million for Naghlu Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, US$ 6
     million for DABS TA, and US$ 50 million for Higher Education Development Project. Additional
     financing for existing projects included US$ 41 million for the Second Public Financial Management Project
     and US$ 45 million for the On-farm Water Management Project. As of March 27, 2016, US$ 368 million
     has disbursed under the Recurrent Cost Window for the FY 2016.
5. The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and places large emphasis on policy
   dialogue. These non-lending activities have been supportive of the Bank’s lending program and have played
   a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and advancing dialogue between the
   Government of Afghanistan and its international development partners. In the last fiscal year, the ARTF
   Steering Committee endorsed the Research and Analysis Program (RAP) which aims to support
   government policy reform agenda and decision-making. The program provides an opportunity to introduce
   innovative ways of working with the Government, universities and local research institutions to introduce
   analysis and generate knowledge. As part of the RAP, the Bank is currently engaged in a series of analytical
   work to enhance understanding of Afghanistan’s growth and fragility challenges and to inform
   development response by Government and international development partners. The initial results of this
   work will be presented at the 2016 Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan in Brussels.
6. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Afghanistan has more than doubled between FY08 and FY14 --
   from around US$ 58 million to about US$ 135 million in FY14. Currently, IFC’s portfolio stands at about
   US$ 54 million and includes one investment in the telecommunication (Roshan), one investment in the
   hotel sector (TPS), and two operations in financial markets (First Microfinance Bank, Afghanistan
   International Bank -- trade facility). IFC’s investments have had a transformational impact (in terms of
   access to finance and outreach), particularly in the microfinance and telecommunication sectors. IFC’s
   Advisory Services program has been supporting the investment program in the areas of access to finance,
   small and medium enterprises (SMEs) capacity development, horticulture/agribusiness and investment

    climate. At present, the focus of IFC’s advisory work is on improving the investment climate through
    reforms in licensing, construction permit and other areas that result into improvements in Doing Business
    Indicators. IFC has also launched the pre-implementation phase of the Lighting Afghanistan Program
    which aims to expand the off gird market and facilitate access of 180,000 households to affordable and
    sage solar lighting solutions. Furthermore IFC is increasing the supply of fresh and processed fruits,
    through improved compliance with market standards and integration of farmers into the value chain of
    leading agribusinesses, giving them access to wider market opportunities. IFC will continue to seek new
    investment opportunities and engage with local players in order to support the development of
    Afghanistan’s private sector, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, finance and microfinance,
    manufacturing, agribusiness, and services.
7. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$ 154 million of gross exposure in
   Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business projects. In 2013, MIGA launched its Conflict
   Affected and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supporting the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan. MIGA
   is currently supporting three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the telecoms
   sector (supporting telecom operator MTN). The other two operations are MIGA-only dairy and cashmere
   production projects.
