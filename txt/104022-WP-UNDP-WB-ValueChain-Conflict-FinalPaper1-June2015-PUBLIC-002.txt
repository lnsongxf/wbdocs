extractives, conflict Prevention and the value chain
introduction
Over the past two and a half decades, extractive resources
(oil, gas, and mining) have played a direct role in more than
a dozen intra-state violent conflicts.3 These conflicts may
centre around control over the natural resource and the rev-
enues it generates; various social groups may use the
resource as a source of funding for generating other types
of conflicts (i.e. social, political, ethnic, etc.); or these
conflicts may be a manifestation of a larger political struggle

6 EI conflicts do not necessarily share the same characteristics of other drivers of violent conflict, such as ethnic tensions, economic
  marginalization, social change, secular divisions, disputes over control of territory, political competition, or other historical grievances.
  But an extractive project on top of any of these other drivers can act as a catalyst, leading to violent conflict.
