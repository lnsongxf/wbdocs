Abstract: The aim of the study is to understand the sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
behavior and determinants among adolescents in El Salvador using data from a survey of 1,258
adolescents’ aged 10-19 and 12 interviews with representatives from the Ministry of Health (MOH),
Ministry of Education (MOE), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. The
study found that adolescents were not educated enough on their sexual and reproductive health
rights (SRHR), and have limited use of and access to contraceptives. Alcohol and violence were
found to be associated with risky sexual behavior, requiring a multisectoral response from the
government and civil society. Adolescents need to receive earlier and more accurate information
on their sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR); and this information should be
disseminated in a way that empowers adolescents to make responsible decisions about their
sexual reproductive health. The MOE could play a vital role in informing adolescents in this area,
and adjust these programs when necessary. Further, the role of parents is critical, as the study
found that adolescents are not receiving adequate and enough SRHR information from their
parents. In addition, the MOH needs to offer adolescent-friendly health services, which includes
trained health personnel. Although adolescents stated that the maternal and child health programs
offered were satisfactory and the government has made an effort at educating adolescents on
HIV/AIDS, both the promotion of contraceptive methods and monitoring adolescent SRHR remain
as key challenges to be addressed by multisectoral interventions.

reproductive rights, human rights-based approach.

Adolescents and youth play an important role in society and represent the largest cohort in the
history of El Salvador. As with many countries in the Region, El Salvador is currently experiencing
a demographic window of opportunity, creating a situation that is conducive for economic
development and poverty reduction. However, these young people – particularly adolescent girls
and young women – continue to face challenges to meeting their sexual and reproductive health
(SRH) needs, challenging their ability to contribute to the country’s development. Indeed,
inadequate access to health information and services, as well as inequitable gender norms,
contributes to a lack of knowledge and awareness about puberty, sexuality, and basic human
rights. These underlying factors lead to poor SRH outcomes, such as high rates of adolescent
pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Although it has been twenty years since the International Conference on Population and
Development (ICPD) first put adolescent sexual and reproductive rights (SRHR) on the political
and public agenda, support and protection for adolescent SRH programs and SRHR policies have
developed at a slower pace in El Salvador. Furthermore, adolescents and youth lack knowledge
about their SRHR. These young people are the next generation of adults and will greatly influence
the achievement of the post-2015 agenda; therefore, investments in SRH education, SRHR, and
human capital are critical.

Acknowledging this importance, the World Bank with support from the Nordic Trust Fund, is
pleased to present Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health in El Salvador. This report is
based on data collected through a quantitative survey and presents the challenges and
opportunities that adolescents in El Salvador face in meeting their SRH needs. It also provides
multisectoral and integrated policy and program recommendations to improve adolescent SRH.
The overarching goal of this report is to contribute to improving the health and wellbeing of young
people through development.

Protecting the health and wellbeing of adolescents and youth is a priority for the World Bank. This
report is intended for visionary leaders responsible for shaping social policies and for decision
makers concerned with the comprehensive health and development of adolescents and youth. It
is our hope that, by disseminating more evidence in adolescent SRH status and policies at country
level, countries will make advances in improving the SRH of young people and thereby secure the
health and well-being of future generations.

The adolescent and youth population 1 is the largest cohort in the history of the world,
representing approximately 26 percent of the global population (United Nations Population
Division, 2012). These young people face health challenges that are closely linked with poverty,
marginalization, and discrimination. Indeed, this key stage of life between childhood and adulthood
is defined by physical, mental, social, and emotional changes. With the onset of puberty, it is at
this time that adolescents and youth begin to define their gender and sexual identities and roles.
These changes are shaped by social determinants, as well as sexual and reproductive health
(SRH) risk and protective factors. Meeting the SRH needs of these young people is, therefore,
important as it affects their health, development, and opportunities for the rest of their lives.

Today’s adolescents and youth face substantial physical, social, and economic barriers to
meeting their SRH potential. Implicit to meeting these needs are human rights; gender
equity and equality; and the provision of healthcare, among others. SRH is a right for
everyone, including young people. When adolescents and youth exercise these rights, they are
better able to protect themselves against STIs, unplanned pregnancies, and take advantage of
educational and other opportunities. In fact, international support for adolescent and youth SRH
and rights has been on the political and public agenda for over 20 years. Indeed, in 1994, the
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) specifically addressed the right
of adolescents to reproductive health education, information, and care (UNFPA, 1994).

Despite this support, however, young people – especially adolescent girls –continue to
consistently face high levels of unmet need for contraception, unplanned pregnancies;
unsafe abortions; sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV; violence;
exploitation; discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; and
maternal mortality and morbidity (UNFPA, 2010). At the global level, for example, adolescent
females 10 to 14 years of age are twice as likely to die in childbirth as adult women, and half of all
new HIV infections occur in young people between 15 and 24 years of age (Pathfinder
International, 2011).

Many countries are currently experiencing a demographic “window of opportunity” in
which there are a larger proportion of working-age persons relative to the dependent
population (World Bank, 2006). This creates a situation that is conducive for development as it
increases the possibility of saving and investing in the economy. Investment in the health,
education, and the rights of young people and the alignment of policies is, therefore, important as
it enables productivity and economic growth. Empowering young people in their health
development, including SRH practices and rights, furthermore, provides them the opportunity to
enter adulthood with strong capabilities. They’ll also be better equipped to make informed
decisions for themselves and their community (World Bank, 2011).

Acknowledging this importance, and in order to understand how countries are addressing
adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), the World Bank conducted
a quantitative study among 1,258 adolescents 10 to 19 years of age as well as 12 semi-

structured stakeholder interviews in El Salvador, using resources provided by the Nordic
Trust Fund (NTF).

The specific objectives of the study included:

        •   Evaluating associations between adolescent sexual and reproductive health, human
            rights, and economic development among adolescents and youth;
        •   Assessing the operational implications of integrating human rights instruments into
            SRH services, within the context of limited fiscal resources;
        •   Systematizing and disseminating the results of these activities in order to support a
            regional and multi-sectorial dialogue on SRHR.

The goals of the study were to promote adolescent-friendly health services; develop pro-
adolescent social programs; develop and implement activities that prevent and respond to
adolescent fertility; and raise awareness among adolescents and youth about the importance of
their rights.

The findings from this study were presented to MOH officials and stakeholders at an
international seminar and workshop on Adolescent and Youth Sexual and Reproductive
Health in Latin America: Incorporating the Human Rights Perspective in Public Health
Investments. The meeting was organized in collaboration with the World Bank and the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) and held in August of 2012 in San Salvador, El Salvador
(Annex I and II).

                                  2.       BACKGROUND

El Salvador is a lower-middle income country with a gross national income (GNI) per capita
of US $3,720 (World Bank, 2013). Young people represent approximately 34 percent of the total
population in El Salvador (World Bank, 2013). These adolescents and youth face several
interrelated-health challenges to meeting their SRH needs and potential. For example, there are
more 15-19 year olds living in poverty than older age groups. Poverty rates also tend to be higher
in rural areas and among females (CEPAL, 2012).

The average number of years of schooling in El Salvador is six, however, education is
compulsory for 9 years (between 7 and 15 years of age), indicating that the average
adolescent drops out of school before this is fulfilled. As is the case with many countries,
adolescent girls are less likely to be enrolled than boys (PAHO, 2012). Education plays an
important role in the life of an adolescent girl in El Salvador as the likelihood of having sex or
getting pregnant decreases with higher educational attainment (FESAL, 2008; Samandari, 2010;
Vala-Haynes, 2013). For example, research has found that 1 out of every 2 adolescent girls without
an education will become a mother before turning 18 years of age; this ratio decreases to 1 in 10
with at least 10 years of education (UNFPA, 2013).

Most adolescents in El Salvador have learned about SRH. One study found that 4 out of every
5 female adolescents had received information on menstruation; STIs, including HIV;
contraception; pregnancy; and sex. Further, approximately 3 out of 4 adolescent girls had received
information on body development during puberty and the human reproductive system. These
adolescents were most likely to learn about SRH through school. In fact, two thirds of adolescent
girls stated that schools were the most common source for disseminating SRH information.
However, although 87 percent of girls learned about HIV/AIDs, only 25 percent were able to
correctly answer all five questions about HIV transmission. Similar results were found for
contraception (FESAL, 2008), raising an issue about the quality of SRH information provided
through schools (Ruiz-Canela, 2012).

Age at sexual debut is young in El Salvador. According to the most recent data available,
approximately 26.8 percent of youth have had sex before the age of fifteen (UNAIDS, 2012).
Indeed, the average age of sexual debut among adolescent girls is 16.3 years with boys initiating
sex at an earlier age (FESAL, 2008). When comparing age at sexual debut to other Central
American countries, Nicaragua has the youngest age at initiation, followed by El Salvador,
Honduras, and Guatemala (UNAIDS, 2012).

Several factors are associated with age at sexual debut including area of residence, social
network, and socioeconomic level. Studies have found that adolescents in urban areas are
more likely to have ever had sex than their rural counterparts (Samandari, 2010; FESAL 2008;
Ruiz-Canela, 2012; Springer AE, 2006). Furthermore, family and friends influence adolescent age
at sexual debut. In fact, siblings and friends that encourage sex are a significant risk factor for
earlier age at sexual debut; other risk factors include a lack of parental monitoring or social support
(Ruiz-Canela, 2012; Springer AE, 2006). For example, female adolescents who perceive low
parental social support are significantly more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours than those
who perceive higher parental social support (Springer A, 2006). In addition, some evidence has
found that sexual activity is higher among the poorest adolescents. One study found that
adolescents in the highest socioeconomic bracket were less likely to have sex than their less



                                                  3
wealthy counterparts (Samandari, 2010), while another found that premarital sexual activity
tended to be higher among the third and fourth wealth quintile in comparison to those in the lowest
two quintiles (FESAL, 2008), indicating that further research is needed in this area to elucidate
whether an association exists.

Research has also found that sexual activity increases with age (Ruiz-Canela, 2012;
Springer AE, 2006; Osorio, 2012). For example, among women, 90 percent have had sex by
twenty years of age in El Salvador. Of these, 21 percent had sex before turning 15 and 69 percent
by late adolescence (FESAL, 2008). Furthermore, 34 percent of adolescent girls 15-19 years of
age report being sexually experienced. These numbers were higher among unmarried women
than married women (26 percent and 7.5 percent respectively), and have increased since the
previous National Household Survey (FESAL 2002-2003) (FESAL, 2008).

Despite a reported high level of contraceptive knowledge, contraceptive use among young
people is low in El Salvador (FESAL, 2008). In 2012, the Salvadorian Ministry of Health
(MINSAL) reported that 18 percent of sexually active females and 28 percent of males used
contraceptives at first sex (MINSAL, 2012). This varied with age, area of residence, and marital
status. Older adolescents and adolescent girls in urban areas were more likely to use
contraception at sexual debut than their younger and rural counterparts, while unmarried
adolescents were less likely to use contraception than their married counterparts (31 percent and
20.5 percent respectively) (FESAL, 2008). Notwithstanding, the literature has found that use of
contraception increases with age at first sex. Twenty-three percent of adolescent girls who initiated
sexual activity before the age of 15 had used contraception at first sexual encounter, while 31
percent used contraception in later adolescence. Studies have also found that use increases with
socioeconomic level and education (FESAL, 2008).

Adolescent fertility is a significant concern in El Salvador with 76 births per 1,000
adolescent females 15-19 years of age, well above the regional average of 69.1 (per 1,000
adolescent women 15-19 years of age) (World Bank, 2013). In 2011, El Salvador was ranked
among the 50 countries with the highest adolescent fertility rates in the world. In fact, seven out of
ten sexually active adolescents 15-19 years of age become pregnant each year, of which
approximately 47 percent are unplanned and 8.9 percent are repeat pregnancies (PAHO, 2012).
Further, approximately 24 percent of adolescents have given birth by their eighteenth birthday
(UNFPA, 2013). In 2008, the MOH found that of these adolescent pregnancies, 10.8 percent were
among unmarried adolescents and 12.7 percent among married adolescents (FESAL, 2008). In
2012, approximately 25,000 adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age gave birth in a health
center, accounting for 23.8 percent of all institutionalized births that year (MINSAL, 2012-2013).

Despite these statistics, however, the adolescent fertility rate in El Salvador has decreased
by 19.3 percent over the last decade. Further, births to adolescents, as a share of all births in
El Salvador, have declined from 30.2 percent in 2005 to 23.8 percent in 2012 (World Bank, 2012).
This is an achievement given that adolescent fertility in the Latin American and Caribbean region
has been decreasing at a slower rate than total fertility since the 1970s (UNICEF, 2007).

Adolescent pregnancy does not occur independently but rather as a result of the
interaction between reinforcing social and economic factors. Age at sexual debut has been
associated with not only sexual behaviours, such as multiple sexual partners and decreased
contraceptive use, but also health and economic outcomes, including an increased risk for STIs;
unplanned pregnancies; lower socioeconomic status; intimate partner violence; and school


                                                  4
abandonment (Wellings, 2006). It also alters the odds of young age at first pregnancy, as older
age at sexual debut lowers the likelihood of getting pregnant during adolescence (Samandari,
2010; Azevedo, 2013). In addition, the lower the socioeconomic level the greater the likelihood of
experiencing an adolescent pregnancy in El Salvador (FESAL, 2008). Other factors that are
associated with adolescent pregnancy include lack of adequate SRH knowledge and information,
a lack of contraceptive use, and a lack of power to exercise SRH rights.

Interestingly, studies have found that adolescent mothers who are more educated when
they found out they were pregnant were less likely to interrupt their education and more
likely to go back to school than less educated mothers. This indicates that education is not
only a protective factor against early pregnancy but also a protective factor against dropping out
of school permanently (FESAL, 2008).

Importantly, adolescent pregnancy entails high medical, social, and economic costs for
society while contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Young age at
first pregnancy impacts a teenager’s education and life prospects. It also is associated with female
disempowerment; poor prenatal, labour and delivery; and postnatal services (IDB, 2011).
Furthermore, it can also lead to maternal morbidity and mortality.

In 2011, MINSAL reported that 11 percent of all maternal deaths were among adolescents,
while PAHO has estimated that as many as 25 to 30 percent of all maternal deaths in El
Salvador were among adolescents 15-19 years of age (MINSAL, World Bank, and PAHO
2012). Overall, adolescents have worse pregnancy outcomes than adult women. Moreover,
adolescent mothers under the age of 16 are at a substantially higher risk of maternal morbidity
and mortality compared to older adolescents (16-19 years of age) (Conde-Agudelo, 2005).

Not only does pregnancy put adolescent lives at risk but an attempt to terminate the
pregnancy does so as well. El Salvador is one of five countries with the strictest abortion laws
in the Region. In El Salvador, abortion is prohibited under any circumstance, even if a woman’s
life is at stake. This violates universal human rights laws by limiting a woman’s right to life and
health, and compromises their life and health even further by making them seek illegal abortions,
which are typically unsafe (Lakhani N, 2013). In 2012, MINSAL reported that approximately 26
percent of women hospitalized due to an abortion were adolescents (MINSAL, 2012).

Furthermore, suicide is one of the main causes of death among pregnant adolescents.
According to MINSAL, suicide is the second cause of death among adolescents between 10 and
19 years of age and is particularly high among pregnant adolescents. It is estimated that it
accounts for half of all pregnant adolescent deaths (Azevedo, 2013).

Within this framework of adolescent and youth SRH, many of the social norms and
expectations related to gender roles, marriage, and fertility have remained the same. These
have dictated adolescent male and female behaviour, exposing them to a different set of risks,
with a particularly negative impact on adolescent girls and young women. For example, machismo
(masculinity) and marianismo (feminity) impact adolescent boys and girls sexual behaviour, sexual
responsibilities, sex education, and access to SRH information and services (PAHO, 2012; Rani,
2003; Remez 2008). One study found that adolescent males were more likely than females to feel
pressured to have sex (32 percent of adolescent males in comparison to 20 percent of females)
(Osorio, 2012). Adolescent females, on the other hand, were encouraged to have sex with older
men for financial benefits. In fact, 13.4 percent of women aged 15-24 who initiated sex between


                                                 5
15 and 19 years of age stated that their partner was their age or younger, in comparison to 30
percent who stated that their first partner was 3-5 years older (Boston University School of Public
Health, 2011). This was even higher among those who initiated sex before 15 years of age, with
37 percent reporting that their first partner was 3-5 years older and 23 percent reporting that he
was 6 to 9 years older (FESAL, 2008).

Gender norms and gender inequality also play a role in sexual abuse and violence.
Approximately 20 percent of sexually active adolescent girls reported experiencing forced
sex. In fact, they were 4 times more likely to report forced sex than their male counterparts
(Springer AE, 2006). According to the Observatory of Gender Violence, adolescent girls between
12 and 18 years of age are also most likely to be victims of sexual violence, followed by women
18-25 years of age (CIDH, 2011). Further, the Salvadorian Institute for the Development of Women
(ISDEMU) reported that between 2008 and 2009, those between 10 and 14 years of age were the
most likely to be raped (IDESMU, 2010).

Another consequence of gender inequality is that adolescent fertility is higher among
females compared to males. For example, 24.4 percent of females in El Salvador have given
birth while 7 percent of sexually experienced adolescent males have impregnated someone
(Springer AE, 2006). In fact, most children of adolescent mothers have adult fathers. In many
cases, the father (especially an adolescent father) refuses to accept responsibility. This gender
inequality leads to several problems. Firstly, the responsibility falls on the adolescent mother and
maternal grandmother. Secondly, the father figure is absent from the household. A father’s
absence in the household can have serious consequences on the child’s development, especially
on girls who are more likely to become pregnant at a younger age, thus, continuing the cycle of
adolescent motherhood.

The provision of adolescent-friendly SRH services in El Salvador is needed, as there is a
high unmet need. Indeed, most services are intended for adults, and many doctors and nurses
are not trained for sharing information and providing services to youth in a sensitive and engaging
way (Rodriguez, 2008). Adolescents and youth in El Salvador, therefore, face several challenges
when accessing SRH services, including, among others, a lack of awareness about their SRH
rights; a lack of SRH knowledge and information; and a lack of confidentiality and negative
attitudes from healthcare providers (Ehrle, 2011).

          3       METHODOLOGY AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

3.1           Methodology

Researchers gathered information through a questionnaire developed by the World Bank
and Health Focus GmbH to understand adolescent SRHR in El Salvador. In addition to
collecting demographic information, the questionnaire explored the following topics:

      •       Adolescent access to SRH information
      •       Knowledge about SRHR and the exercise of these rights
      •       Gender and sexuality
      •       SRH knowledge, attitudes, and practices
      •       Violence, depression, and discrimination
      •       SRH services

A human rights based conceptual framework was developed and guided the content of the
questionnaire. It was built upon a human rights based approach to programing and the goals of
the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994; the ICPD+5 1999; the
ICPD+10 2004; and the 2005 23rd Special Session of the General for the Review and Appraisal
of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Outcome Document (Beijing+10). It also
utilized various conventions and human rights principles that have been ratified by El Salvador.

A representative sample of adolescents (both sexes) was recruited through a nationwide
randomly selected process at the household level from the 14 districts in El Salvador. The
sample size was based on 2008 census estimates with a confidence interval of 95 percent and an
error margin of +/- 4 percent. The statistically significant sample was estimated according to the
population share in each of the districts, separated by rural and urban areas, gender, and age. An
additional 5 percent of the population was added to the sample to anticipate the possibility of
invalidity of some questionnaires.

A pilot study was conducted in order to test the questionnaire and to standardize
procedures. It was conducted in a randomly selected district in which the field team surveyed 30
participants (20 in an urban area and 10 in a rural area). The final version of the questionnaire
was adjusted accordingly.

Participants were approached in their homes by interviewers who had been trained prior
to the start of the study. Interviewers established initial contact with the participants, describing
the questionnaire and the purpose of the study while providing them with informed consent. Each
participant’s consent was obtained prior to the start of the study. They understood that the survey
would be anonymous and confidential. They then set a time to come back and conduct the survey.
In households that had more than one eligible participant, only one was interviewed. Further,
participants were informed that the SRH tools used have already proven valid (e.g.. UNFPA,
PAHO).

The data was analyzed using SPSS for Windows, version 14.0. A Likert Scale of 1 to 5 was
used for questions that addressed attitudes (for example, strongly agree; agree; neither agree nor
disagree; disagree; strongly disagree). Quantitative methods (for example, frequency,



                                                  7
percentages, average) as well as bi- and multi-variable regression analyses were used to analyse
closed questions. In order to assess knowledge regarding human rights, sexual rights,
reproductive rights, social determinants of SRH, and social interaction, a scale was constructed
corresponding to these categories. For the open-ended questions, two analytical techniques were
used: content analyses for the system of categories and ethnographic analyses.

A total of 1,258 participants 10-19 years of age participated in the survey. There were a total
of 630 females and 628 males. Of these, approximately one third (n=439) were 10-14 years of
age and two-thirds (n=819) 15-19 years of age. Over half of the participants (56.5 percent) lived
in urban areas while 43.5 percent lived in rural areas.

Stakeholder interviews were also conducted in order to understand the government’s
efforts at guaranteeing adolescent SRHR. These interviews were conducted among a randomly
selected group of representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), United Nations
organizations, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health. Inclusion criteria for the
stakeholder interviews included a minimum of one year of service as well as voluntary participation
in the interview. Coordinators and heads of service, as well as SRH health workers were
interviewed.

A total of 12 interviews were conducted. Two interviews were conducted among
representatives from NGOs, 1 from an United Nations organization, 3 from the Ministry of
Education, and 6 from the Ministry of Health.


3.2     Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework that was used in the study was developed to provide overall guidance
in the development of the questionnaire and implementing ASRHR in El Salvador. The framework
builds on the following: a human rights-based approach (HRBA) to programming; several
international conferences on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); and El Salvador’s
legal obligations to SRH.

Human Rights-Based Approach

When using an HRBA to develop and implement adolescent SRH programs, it is important
to recognize and address the diversity of needs. Each young person has a unique set of life
circumstances and develops at their own pace. For example, sexually and non-sexually active
adolescents, young mothers, adolescents with disabilities, young married couples, abused
adolescents, adolescents with HIV/AIDS, and poor and marginalized adolescents and youth all
have different needs. These needs must, therefore, be approached and addressed in different
ways (UNFPA, 1994).

It also requires viewing adolescents and youth as “right holders”, or individuals who are
aware of and able to exercise their rights. This necessitates that governments be accountable
for their actions to prevent and reduce barriers that lead to human rights violations (BMZ, 2008).
It also entails employing a holistic approach to adolescents and youth when examining their civil,
political, social, economic, and cultural rights (Boesen, 2007). For example, for adolescent SRH,
comprehensive gender and socio-culturally sensitive approaches to information and educational




                                                8
activities and services should be provided in order to encourage healthy and responsible
behaviours (UNAIDS, 2012).

Furthermore, certain principles must be incorporated into adolescent SRH policies and
programs, including non-discrimination and equality; participation and empowerment; and
transparency and accountability.

Non-discrimination and Equality
One of the most important components to realizing a young person’s right to health is non-
discrimination and equality. This requires that governments respect, protect, and fulfil all human
rights (for example, civil, political, social, economic, and cultural) regardless of age, sex, sexual
orientation, mental or physical health, ethnic or religious affiliation, and other status 2 (OHCHR,
1976). This also entails analysing the structural and indirect forms of discrimination in terms of
public policies (or lack thereof), local power structures, and cultural practices. For example, this
includes policies that deny adolescents’ access to SRH information and education, or cultural
practices that put the parental responsibility on the mother instead of the father (Boesen, 2007).

With equality, governments must prioritize access to quality health services, focusing on the most
marginalized and vulnerable groups and the proper allocation of health resources (OHCHR, 1976).

Participation and Empowerment
Participation and empowerment signify that even the most marginalized and vulnerable groups
are able to exercise their rights and participate in the decision-making processes that affect them.
This requires governments to implement recommendations from international human rights
bodies, suggesting that participation is not only a development tool but also a goal within itself
(Boesen, 2007).

Transparency and Accountability
Transparency and accountability are two critical components of young people’s right to health. It
is the ability of citizens to monitor policies, and requires governments to analyse the causes of
poverty, deprivation, and human rights violations in order to set priorities. These priorities should
include expanding young people’s choice and increasing their ability to exercise rights, as well as
target economic improvement (GTZ, 2009).

Accountability mechanisms can include judicial (for example, public interest litigation); quasi-
judicial (for example, reviews by national human rights institutions); administrative (for example,
complaint desks at public service offices); political (for example, elected health or education
councils); or social (for example, the involvement of civil society in monitoring policies and
budgets) (GTZ, 2009).

International Conferences on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights

Several conferences over the last twenty years have been held that have put SRHR on the political
and public agenda. Four of these conferences are highlighted below. The documents that have
resulted from these conferences are important tools for SRHR advocates and women’s rights.

expansion.

The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994
Twenty years ago, ICPD 1994 was held in Cairo (UNFPA, 1994). It was at this Conference that
delegates from 179 countries made significant advances in putting SRH, including adolescent
SRHR, on the political and public agenda. These countries agreed that:


 Reproductive rights are a set of human rights described in international treaties,
 including the right of individuals and couples to decide on the timing and spacing
 of pregnancies, health
 Reproductive     to have is a state
                           the       of complete
                               information         physical,
                                             and means       mental
                                                          to do      and
                                                                so, and tosocial wellbeing
                                                                           be free from
 and  not merely  the absence   of disease or infirmity,
 coercion, discrimination, and violence. (UNFPA, 1995)   in all matters relating  to the
 reproductive system, and to its functions and processes. Reproductive health
 therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe life and that
 they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how
 often to do so. (UNFPA, 1995)
 People have the right to family planning and SRH information as stated that:
 all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the
 number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and
 means to do so. (UNFPA, 1995)


The Conference also recognized adolescent vulnerability and the need for reproductive
health (RH) education and services, urging governments to provide private and confidential
family planning (FP) information and services to sexually active adolescents, including services
for STIs and sexual abuse, as well as information on how to prevent adolescent pregnancies and
avoid poor reproductive health outcomes (UNFPA, 1994).

In the years since ICPD 1994, various meetings and pronouncements have reaffirmed the
role of reproductive rights and reproductive health in achieving human rights, reducing
poverty, attaining gender equality, building a world free of violence against women and
girls, preventing HIV/AIDS, and attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
(UNFPA, 2008). At the ICPD+5, delegates reviewed the Plan of Action (POA) and set specific
benchmarks for youth obtaining SRH services, including access to male and female condoms
(UN, 1999b). However, post-ICPD+5 agreements have omitted any mention of youth access to
condoms. At the ICPD+10, delegates from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Asia-
Pacific asked governments to address unsafe abortion through appropriate strategies, as it was
and continues to be a major public health concern (Reichenbach and Roseman, 2009). The
Beijing+10 went one step further and mentioned sexual rights. This was a major milestone for
sexual health and rights given that since 1999 no agreement had been made that unconditionally
recognized governments’ obligation to provide universal access to confidential SRH services to
young people, regardless of age, parental consent, or marital status (Reichenbach and Roseman,
2009).

El Salvador’s Ratification of International Treaties and Human Rights Principles
The observations and recommendations from the present study were compared to various
conventions ratified by El Salvador, including among others, the 1948 Universal
Declaration (UN General Assembly, 1948); the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination (UN General Assembly, 1979); and the 1989 Convention on the



                                              10
Rights of the Child (CRC) (UN General Assembly, 1989). Further, the study reviewed and
utilized human rights principles relevant to adolescent SRHR. Table 1 illustrates examples of El
Salvador trying to meet these human rights principles.

4.1     Socio-Demographic Profile

This section presents information on the demographic background within which Salvadorian
adolescents live. Importantly, their background and the social, economic, and cultural environment
in which they are raised and develop impact their SRH choices. These basic characteristics
provide the background for interpreting findings on SRH presented later in the report.

Education

According to the study, approximately 81.4 percent of adolescents interviewed were in
school at the time of the study, with girls significantly less likely to be enrolled than boys
(figure 1). Further, 39.7 percent of adolescents reported that they had completed 7th – 9th grade;
20.5 percent of adolescents had received a diploma from a technical/trade school; and 1.6 percent
were university students. In addition, approximately 40 percent of adolescents stated that they
had not completed 6th grade.

Family and Household Arrangements

Most adolescents were dependent on their parents or another adult in their life. Households
ranged from living with parents (both or either), grandparents, siblings, partners, stepparents,
godparents, or in-laws. Few lived alone. Most adolescents lived in large families with their parents
and relatives. In fact, 58.2 percent of adolescents lived in households with 5 to 9 family members;
36.7 percent lived with 1 to 4 relatives; and 5.1 percent lived with 10 or more relatives.

More adolescent boys reported living with their fathers than adolescent girls (46.2 percent
and 39.5 percent respectively). Participants were less likely to live with their mothers (30.9



                                                12
percent of boys and 33 percent of girls), and even fewer with their grandparents (10.8 percent).
More than half of participants’ parents lived together (54.1 percent) or were married (boys were
more likely to report this than girls at 57.4 percent and 50.5 percent respectively). Approximately
32.6 percent reported that their parents were divorced or separated, with 4.1 percent having a
deceased parent.

Most of the participants were financially supported by their fathers (47.2 percent), while
28.7 percent were supported by their mothers. Further, approximately 28 percent reported
that both parents worked, while 32.6 percent stated that their father was employed and 16.8
percent reported that their mother was employed.

Employment

A total of 17.5 percent of participants reported that they worked. Adolescent boys were more
likely to work outside of their homes than girls (25.6 percent and 9.3 percent respectively) (p =
0.000). 3 Among girls who worked, 70 percent worked more than 20 hours a week, 16 percent
worked 10-20 hours, and 14 percent worked less than 9 hours. Among the boys who worked, 63
percent worked more than 20 hours a week, 22.9 percent worked between 10 and 20 hours, and
14.9 percent worked less than nine hours (figure 2). On average girls made approximately USD
$47.50 per month while boys made USD $50.80 per month.

Remittances and Household Expenses

Remittances are an important source of Salvadorian family income, with 30.3 percent of
adolescents reporting that they have lived in households that receive them. Only 3.5 percent
of adolescents, however, reported directly receiving remittances. The average amount of each
household remittance was approximately USD $173.20, with an average household receiving

                                               13
approximately USD $2,279.60 per year in remittances. There was no significant difference by area
of residence (p=0.28) 4.

On average, households spent approximately USD $160.20 on monthly food purchases (for
example, food, drinks, and tobacco). Urban areas spent significantly more on monthly food
purchases than rural areas (USD $176.20 and $138.90 respectively) (p=0.000). 5 Further, the
average total monthly expense per household was approximately USD $312.10 and significantly
differed based on area of residence (p=0.000). 6 Urban households on average spent USD
$342.50 per month while rural households spent approximately USD $273.10 per month.

Area of Residence

When looking at household differences by geographic location, the study found that
adolescents in rural areas were less likely to have a television, fixed telephone line,
refrigerator, and vehicle in comparison to adolescents in urban areas (figure 3).

of age) (percent).

Social Benefits and Group Membership

Sixty percent of Salvadorian households benefitted from educational programs provided
through the Ministry of Education (MOE). These included such programs as the “healthy school
program” (25.8 percent), school meals (78.5 percent), and uniforms (95.8 percent). This differed
by geographic location in that households in rural areas received more social benefits than urban
areas (67.9 percent and 55.3 percent respectively).

Approximately a third of the adolescents (35.2 percent) reported belonging to a youth
group, with more boys than girls participating in these groups (39.8 percent and 30.5

were generally organized through schools; 37.2 percent stated they were organized through
churches; and 15.6 percent stated that they were organized around community associations and
NGOs. Typical activities included sports, cultural and religious events, and social work. Boys were
more likely to partake in sports (60 percent and 31.8 percent respectively), while girls were more
likely to participate in religious activities (44.6 percent and 29.2 percent respectively).

4.2     Sexual and Reproductive Health

This section presents information collected through the survey on adolescent SRH in El Salvador.
There are multiple factors that influence adolescent SRH including education and career
aspirations; access to healthcare; attitudes towards contraception; community, cultural, and
familial expectations; among others. These findings provide evidence for the importance of
developing adolescent SRH programs and guaranteeing and enforcing adolescent SRHR policies
in El Salvador.

Access to SRH Information

The study found that although 85 percent of Salvadorian adolescents reported learning
about SRH, the information was often insufficient. For example, only 10 percent of
adolescents knew at which stage in the menstrual cycle they were most likely to become pregnant.
This varied by age, sex, and residence. Adolescents 15-19 years of age were significantly more
likely to know more about SRH than those 10-14 years of age (57 percent and 36.9 percent
respectively); adolescent girls had greater knowledge than boys; and urban residents were likely
to receive more information on SRH than rural residents. Furthermore, the information varied by
topic and sex. Adolescent girls were more likely to learn about the female reproductive system,
FP, and violence; while adolescent boys were more likely to learn about the male reproductive
system, sexual rights, and making informed decisions.

When asked to provide the most common sources for learning about SRH, 67 percent of
adolescents ranked school as the most common source (figure 4). Adolescents stated that –
at school – they were most likely to learn about the human reproductive system and HIV/AIDS,
followed by FP, gender equality, and responsible decision-making (figure 5).

The second most common source for learning about SRH was mothers, followed by
fathers. Adolescent girls were more likely to speak with their mothers about SRH while adolescent
boys were more likely to speak with their fathers. At home, adolescents reported that they were
most likely to learn about responsible decision-making and life- plans from their parents. Similar
results were found in both urban and rural areas (52.9 percent and 46.2 percent respectively). In
addition, 8.8 percent of adolescents stated that they talked to their parents about their sexual
health rights, while 8.4 percent reported that they spoke about their reproductive health rights.
Further, adolescent females were more likely to state that family was the most important source
for learning about sexuality than adolescent males (54.7 percent and 45.5 percent respectively).

health and rights Survey: El Salvador. Survey commissioned by the World Bank.

Another common source of information about SRH was health personnel. Adolescents
reported that they were most likely to learn about health-related issues, such as sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), contraception and FP methods, and sexuality. In fact, 4.4 percent of
rural adolescents reported that they received SRH information from health centers as opposed to
2 percent of urban adolescents. Friends were another importance source of providing information
on SRH. In contrast, the study found that the media (for example, radio, television, the internet,
and newspapers) was not an educational source for SRH information. In fact, adolescents found
that the media increased their interest in pornography, glorified risky sexual behaviors, and
sexually stimulated them.




                                               16
SRHR Knowledge and the Exercise of these Rights

Approximately 50.6 percent of adolescent males and 49.4 percent of females reported that
they knew about SRHR, with adolescents 15-19 years of age more likely to know about
these rights than those 10-14 years of age (57 percent and 36.9 percent respectively). Of
those aware of their rights, 92.1 percent reported that they understood them and 93.7 percent said
that the knowledge was valuable. Regression analyses conducted found that knowing about
SRHR reduced the risk of becoming a parent by 66 percent, while it also reduced the risk of being
mistreated by 46 percent. The figure below indicates that adolescents were most aware of the
right to marry or enter into a common law union, followed by the ability to choose a sexual partner,
and the right to information on sexuality. Adolescents were least aware about rights concerning
sexual pleasure and therapeutic abortion. Adolescents 15-19 years of age and adolescent boys
were more likely to think that these rights were guaranteed and should be respected in comparison
to their counterparts.

(10-19 years of age) (percent).

health and rights Survey: El Salvador. Survey commissioned by the World Bank.


Adolescents did state, however, that they believed that their SRHR were not fully
guaranteed in El Salvador. This was due to a lack of adequate and available SRHR information,
as well as a perception of having limited control over their lives and relationships due to societal
and familial restrictions. For example, the right to decide when to marry or enter a common law
union could not be exercised because parents and friends influenced their relationship, as well as
their right to choose a sexual partner, as sex was not permitted in their household.

Further, adolescents stated that there was a lack of information on: contraceptive use, the
right to decide when to initiate one’s sex life, and the right to sexual pleasure. Of great
concern to adolescents was that the right to report sexual abuse was not guaranteed and
enforced.




                                                17
When asked where they had learned about these rights, adolescents stated that they heard
about them through schools and at home. Other sources included health centers, NGOs, the
Attorney General’s office, and television.

Importantly, adolescents questioned the validity of some SRHR principles recognized by
the international community. They stated that they thought that the right to sexual pleasure did
not exist and that sexual pleasure should not be promoted given that it represents promiscuity and
the spread of STIs. Further, due to social norms and discrimination, adolescents questioned the
right to sexual diversity. In addition, a third of adolescents stated that the right to therapeutic
abortion did not exist, and more than 15 percent of adolescents knew that abortions were illegal
in El Salvador.

Gender and Sexuality

Gender Norms

According to the study, Salvadorian adolescents’ ideas of masculinity and femininity were
based on social, community, and religious beliefs. For example, adolescents reported that
they believed that physical differences exist between men and women and that this defines
societal expectations: the woman’s role is to be a mother, raise children, and take care of the
household, while the man’s role is as the head of the household, responsible for working and
supporting the family. Although they reported that it was also the woman’s role to defer to the
man’s opinion and that young women often felt guilty over expressing their own opinion, the
majority of adolescents felt that women were not respected in their communities.

Adolescent boys were seen as disruptive, associated with gangs, substance abuse, and
crime; while adolescent girls were disrespected for being teenage mothers and not
provided adequate assistance or counseling. According to the study, adolescents reported that
these gender differences were associated with risky sexual behaviors and unplanned
pregnancies.


Sexual Norms

When asked about male and female sexual norms, 30.9 percent of adolescents (33.3
percent of adolescent girls and 28.5 percent of adolescent boys) reported that they thought
all men had an uncontrollable need to have sex while 15.3 percent of adolescents (12.7
percent of adolescent girls and 17.8 percent of adolescent boys) thought that women had
this same need. Forty-four percent of adolescents thought that it was acceptable for men to have
multiple sexual partners, while only four percent thought this was acceptable for women. Further,
30.4 percent of adolescents said men should initiate sexual relations, while 17.6 percent said
women should.

Five percent of adolescents stated that men could have sex with their partner even if his
partner didn’t want to, while eight percent stated that a woman could have sex with her
partner, even if her partner did not want to. Moreover, 7.9 percent of adolescents stated that
women should only have sex to please their partners. In addition, 13.8 percent of adolescents
reported that males could postpone having sex while 11 percent of adolescents said that females




                                               18
could do the same. They also reported that young women were much more likely to be stigmatized
for being unfaithful than young men.

Sexual Orientation

Most adolescents reported that homosexuality was abnormal. They stated that they thought
they would fail as parents if their children were homosexual; in fact, the majority stated that they
would try to seek professional help to change their child’s sexual or gender identity. Although 11.4
percent of adolescents reported that sex among same-sex couples was acceptable and 0.7
percent identified as being attracted to the same sex, the majority used negative terms when
referring to homosexuality stating that it was against religion. In addition, adolescents thought that
homosexuality arose from childhood sexual abuse, as well as the media’s influence on promoting
sexual diversity. Despite their overall negative view of homosexuality, the majority of adolescents
stated that all people should be respected, regardless of their sexual or gender identity.

When asked about where they sought support for their sexuality, 50.1 percent of
adolescents reported that their families supported them, followed by schools, friends, and
health workers (figure 7). Other responses included churches, boyfriends/partners, spiritual
guides, godmothers, books, and the media (for example, internet, radio, and television).

SRH Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices

Sexual Debut

The average age of sexual debut among 10-14 year olds was 13.2 years, while the average
age among 15-19 year olds was 15.4 years. There was a statistically significant difference
between the age at sexual debut for adolescent girls (15.9 years) and adolescent boys (14.8
years). Further, the average age at sexual debut was significantly higher among rural areas in
comparison to urban areas (15.6 years and 15 years respectively). Most adolescents reported
having their first sexual experience with either a boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, or spouse.


                                                 19
Approximately 3 percent of adolescents 10-14 years of age claimed to have had sex in
comparison to 40.8 percent of those 15-19 years of age. More adolescent boys stated that
they had sex than girls (32.1 percent and 23.1 percent respectively), and more adolescents in
rural areas had sex than urban areas (29.2 percent and 26.3 percent respectively).

Over 50 percent of adolescents stated that their first sexual experience was voluntary and
planned. Of these, 77.2 percent of adolescents reported that the decision was made jointly with
their partners, while 6.6 percent stated that the decision was made alone. Of those that made the
decision alone, 2.1 percent were girls and 6.8 percent were boys. Further, 49.6 percent of
adolescents stated that their first sexual experience was voluntary but not planned. This was true
for 61.5 percent of 10-14 year olds and 49.1 percent of 15-19 year olds.

Three adolescents reported that their first experience was the result of sexual abuse and
one reported that it was involuntary due to pressure. Approximately 5.6 percent of adolescents
15-19 years of age reported that they felt pressured the first time they had sex, with adolescent
girls more likely to feel pressure than boys (9.7 percent and 2.5 percent respectively). Of those
who felt pressured, 6 became pregnant and 2 thought about having an abortion.

Of those who were sexually active, 88.5 percent of adolescents reported that their first
sexual experience was enjoyable, while 11.5 percent stated that they did not enjoy it. Of
those who did not enjoy it, approximately 18.5 percent were adolescent girls and 6.4 percent were
boys.

Adolescents 15-19 years of age were more likely to report that alcohol consumption was a
factor during their first sexual experience (8 percent in urban areas and 5.1 percent in rural
areas). This varied by sex with adolescent boys more likely to report alcohol consumption than
girls (8.2 percent and 4.4 percent respectively).

When asked about their greatest fear in having sex, 84.7 percent of adolescents reported
that they were most afraid of getting pregnant (91.7 percent of 10-14 year olds and 84.4
percent of 15-19 year olds), with girls more afraid of getting pregnant than boys



                                               20
impregnating someone (86.2 percent of girls and 83.6 percent of boys). Other reported fears
included parents finding out (4.6 percent of girls and 4.2 percent of boys); an inability to satisfy a
sexual partner; or an inability to fulfill the act.

Of those who were not sexually active, reasons as to why they have not had sex yet
included that they were not emotionally mature; they wanted to wait; they were worried
about getting pregnant; they were afraid to impregnate someone; they were following
parental advice; and religion (table 2). Other reasons included not being old enough and the
negative consequences associated with sex.

In addition, more adolescents thought that pleasure was part of having sex and was not just
for reproduction (figure 8); while 41.4 percent thought it was bad to masturbate.

Contraceptive Use

Approximately 54 percent of sexually active adolescents reported using a contraceptive
method the first time they had sex. This varied by age and geographic location. At first sex, the
study found that adolescent boys (64.8 percent of boys and 38.2 percent of girls) and urban areas
were more likely to use contraception (57.3 percent in urban areas and 49.4 percent in rural areas).
In both sexes, the use of contraception increased substantially from first to last sex: from 38.2
percent to 55.6 percent in adolescent girls and 64.8 percent to 67.3 percent in adolescent males.

When asked about regular use of contraception, adolescent boys were more likely to report
regular use than girls (51 percent and 38 percent respectively) (table 3). Oral contraceptives
were the most common method, followed by condoms and contraception injection (Figure 9).
Other contraceptives and practices adolescents reported using were anal sex, oral sex, intra-
uterine devices (IUDs), the “day-after” pill, skin patches, vaginal rings and implants, abstinence,
coitus interrupts, and the rhythm method. Furthermore, approximately 52.9 percent of sexually
active 15-19 year olds and 20 percent of 10-14 year olds stated that they used the morning after
pill at some point in their life.

Approximately 87.5 percent of adolescents had heard of condoms and knew how to use
them, however only 17.7 percent of adolescents reported using them regularly. Further, 12.5
percent of adolescents did not know about condoms (30 percent of which were 10-14 years of age
and 3.1 percent were 15-19 years of age), while 2.7 percent of adolescents stated that individuals
should always use a condom. Access to and preference for condoms was limited among
adolescents. For example, 11.4 percent of adolescents 10-14 years of age and 9.9 percent of 15-
19 year olds stated that condoms were not sold to minors.

Among those who were sexually active but did not use contraception, when asked why
they did not use contraception, adolescents responded that: they did not think about it; they
were too embarrassed to buy them; they didn’t think they were sold to minors; they weren’t
prepared; they lacked contraceptive knowledge; they weren’t sexually active; they thought it
caused health problems; they thought it was too much work and didn’t know how to use them;
their partners might think them unfaithful; they didn’t think it was one hundred percent effective;
and they thought it reduced sexual pleasure.

Approximately 10.8 percent of adolescents did not know how to prevent pregnancy, with
adolescent boys less likely to know than girls (12.5 percent and 8.7 percent respectively).
This was associated with age and residence. Among adolescents 10-14 years of age, 27.9 percent
did not know how to prevent pregnancies in comparison to 7.9 percent of those 15-19 years of
age; those in rural areas had less knowledge than urban areas (9.1 percent and 11.8 percent
respectively). Further, of those who were sexually active, 7.1 percent reported that they did not
know how to prevent pregnancies.


                                               22
Slightly more than half (53.4 percent) of the adolescents surveyed attended information
sessions on contraception, and approximately 63.8 percent thought both men and women
were responsible for preventing pregnancies. More adolescent girls stated that it was the
woman’s responsibility to prevent unplanned pregnancies (25.5 percent of adolescent girls and
12.9 percent of boys respectively), while more adolescent boys reported that it was the man’s
responsibility (13.8 percent of adolescent boys and 6.4 percent of girls). In addition, more than
half (55.3 percent) thought that abstinence was the best contraceptive method. Further, 39.7
percent thought that adolescent girls should take the pill, while 54.4 percent thought that a
correctly used condom protected against pregnancies in 96 percent of the cases.

Approximately 35.7 percent of adolescents 10-14 years of age and 6.5 percent of
adolescents 15-19 years of age thought they could easily obtain contraceptives from health
centers; while slightly more than half stated that they did not know if this was possible, indicating
that they did not associate or access contraceptives at health centers.

Pregnancy

Among female participants, approximately 12 percent had given birth, while among male
participants approximately 3 percent were fathers. In fact, adolescent girls were significantly
more likely to become a mother than adolescent boys becoming a father. Further, results from the
regression analyses found that an adolescent girl was 8 times more likely to become a parent than
an adolescent boy, even if the boy underreported paternity. Furthermore, the risk of becoming a
parent increased with age (by a factor of three for each year); however the risk of becoming a
parent was reduced by one-fifth if the household benefited from social programs; if the adolescent
participated in a youth group; and it reduced the risk by one third if the household had a telephone
line.

In terms of relationship status, 92.9 percent of adolescent parents were single; 6.2 percent
were cohabitating with their partner; and 1 percent were married (9.7 percent of girls and 2

percent of boys) (figure 10). However, more boys (41.5 percent) claimed to have a lover or
girlfriend than girls (32.6 percent).

Knowledge about pregnancy was limited among both 10-14 year old and 15-19 year old
adolescent girls. For example, although 75 percent of 10-14 year olds had been taught when a
woman becomes pregnant, only 16.6 percent knew at which point in the menstrual cycle this was
most likely to occur. Among 15-19 year olds, although 49.9 percent stated that they learned at
which stage this was most likely to occur, 9.6 percent knew the correct answer.

The study also found that adolescent knowledge about pregnancy-related health issues
was limited. According to the surveyed adolescents, the most common diseases for pregnant
women were HIV (52.5 percent), heart problems (9.4 percent), and genital herpes (7.9 percent).
Diseases less frequently mentioned were dengue, influenza, systemic lupus erythematous,
chronic heart or kidney diseases, breast and uterine cancer. This varied with age in that
adolescents 10-14 years of age were less likely to identify potential diseases in comparison with
their older counterparts.

Woman to Become Pregnant by Sex and Stage of Life (percent).

health and rights Survey: El Salvador. Survey commissioned by the World Bank.

The study also found that adolescents had a negative view of pregnancy, with adolescents
stating that a woman should become pregnant when she is economically independent from
her parents (figure 11). They also stated that becoming pregnant signified the end of
adolescence and the beginning of adulthood (39.2 percent of adolescent girls and 28.7 percent of
boys); and 54.9 percent stated that it signified school abandonment. Approximately 31 percent
stated that it meant entering the workforce in order to financially provide for the child. Further, 6.1
percent of adolescent boys and 3.1 percent of girls stated that pregnant girls had fewer work
opportunities, while 1.4 percent of boys and 0.3 percent of girls reported that they could become
criminals or commit suicide.

Fifty-three percent of adolescents thought that adolescent mothers’ responsibilities
involved taking care of the child (39.4 percent of adolescent girls and 32.6 percent of boys)
and fighting for their rights (9.4 percent of adolescent girls and 6.2 percent of boys). Other



                                                 24
responsibilities included helping their partner and sharing responsibilities (25.5 percent); self-care
during pregnancy (16.5 percent); accepting the pregnancy even if it was unplanned (10.7 percent);
and taking steps to prevent future pregnancies (3.6 percent). More adolescent boys and
adolescents 10-14 years of age reported that they did not know what a pregnant adolescent’s
responsibilities were.

For an adolescent father, 35.6 percent of adolescent girls and 31.8 percent of boys stated
that it implied the beginning of adulthood; it also signified the end of life plans, as they had
to work to provide for their family (31.8 percent of adolescent girls and 29.1 percent of
boys). Sixty percent of adolescents reported that it also connotes school abandonment and limited
career opportunities (5.9 percent of adolescent girls and 3.3 percent of boys), while approximately
8 percent of adolescents stated it that it implied marriage or a common law union with the mother
of the child.

According to the figure below, participants stated that they thought adolescent fathers had
to assume more parental responsibilities in terms of physical, emotional, and financial
support for both their partner and child. Adolescents 15-19 years of age were more likely to
think that adolescent fathers had to assume more responsibilities than their younger counterparts.
They also thought that adolescent fathers should live in a common law union with the mother of
their child; establish a household; and not have other girlfriends.

Responsibilities by Age (percent).

health and rights Survey: El Salvador. Survey commissioned by the World Bank.

Among adolescent girls who reported having been pregnant, 86.1 percent had been
pregnant once and 13.9 percent had been pregnant twice. This varied by area of residence
with adolescents in rural areas significantly more likely to get pregnant than adolescents in urban
areas (16.7 percent and 10 percent respectively). Approximately 43.8 percent were planned



                                                 25
pregnancies and 56.2 percent were unplanned. Reasons for keeping the child included wanting
to be a mother; not wanting to be alone; and stating that it was morally and legally unacceptable
(figure 13).

Of the 56 percent who thought that not keeping their baby was morally and legally
unacceptable, they gave the following reasons: 16.4 percent stated that abortion was a sin;
11.5 percent stated that the child was a gift from God; 8.2 percent stated that they had no other
alternative; 6.6 percent had to accept the consequences of their behaviour; 4.9 percent thought
the child was part of them; 4.9 percent stated that the child was innocent; and 3.3 percent thought
that the child meant life. Despite these figures, adolescent girls were significantly more likely to
have a negative view about parenthood than boys.

Complementing the results of the Adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights
Survey, the focus group discussions with the participation of 18 adolescent fathers (15-19
years old) provided valuable information about their perception about fatherhood. When
asked about fatherhood, 5 fathers saw it as a way to gain social respect and status; 2 reported
that it was experience; 2 stated that it was responsibility; and 1 thought it was joy. Five adolescent
fathers said they gained nothing and one said he did not know what to think. In addition, 5 stated
that they lost their freedom; 3 their childhood and adolescence; 2 reported that they lost their
academic opportunities; 1 stated that he lost financial and emotional support from his family; and
2 stated that they had lost nothing.

Of the 18 adolescent fathers participating in the focus group discussions, 13 (72 percent)
reported that they financially supported their children while 1 stated that he did not; 4 did
not respond. When asked what activities they engaged in with their children, adolescent fathers
stated that they played with them; took care of them; fed them; clothed them; bathed them; and
took them to school.




                                                 26
Further, adolescent fathers reported that their partner’s pregnancy changed their lives. In
fact, 8 started to work; 4 left school; and 3 had to leave their parents’ home. They stated that they
were more responsible; that they would be more careful in the future; that they learned that there
were consequences to sex; that life was more difficult; that they had to do an apprenticeship to
work; that they were working more than normal; and that they did not go out with their friends
anymore.

Sexually Transmitted Infections

The study found that adolescent knowledge about STI transmission was limited, with
adolescents 15-19 years of age knowing more about transmission than those 10-14 years
of age. For example, approximately 50.7 percent believed that they could get an STI if they did
not use a condom; 36.8 percent if they had multiple sexual partners; 13.3 percent if they did not
know that their partner was infected; 6.4 percent if they did not practice abstinence; and 5.1
percent if they had unplanned sex. Less frequently mentioned sources for STIs included infected
needles and blood transfusions (2.2 percent). Eleven percent of adolescents reported that they
did not know how people contracted an STI. This varied by area of residence with rural areas
knowing significantly less about STIs than their urban counterparts.

Approximately 6.7 percent denied that STIs existed, while 68.4 percent of adolescents 10-
14 years of age and 93.7 percent of adolescents 15-19 years of age stated that STIs did
exist, with urban areas more likely to report this than rural areas (87.1 percent and 82.1 percent
respectively).

Thirty-five percent of adolescents (17.6 percent of 10-14 year olds and 44.8 percent of 15-
19 year olds) stated that they received information from health centers about STI
prevention, while 57.6 percent of adolescents stated that they did not receive any
information from health centers. Of those who received information, they all agreed that the
information was useful. More adolescents from rural areas received information from health
centers on STIs than their urban counterparts (39.7 percent and 32.1 percent respectively). In
terms of knowledge about STIs, adolescents knew most about HIV, followed by syphilis,
gonorrhea, HPV, genital herpes, and hepatitis B (figure 14).

A total of 6 adolescents 15-19 years of age stated that they were diagnosed with an STI (4
girls and 2 boys; 4 lived in urban areas and 2 lived in rural areas). All stated that health
providers respected their right to confidentiality. Further, they reported that they received medical
care from one of the following: the MOH, a private clinic, university physician, or pharmacy. All
stated that they had not used condoms during their most recent sexual encounter, although they
said that they had received information on STIs and contraception.

SRH Services

Almost two thirds (62.7 percent) of adolescents reported that they used general health care
services, with similar rates found in rural and urban areas. However, it was significantly higher
among adolescent girls than boys (66.6 percent and 58.9 percent respectively). Among those who
did not use health services, reasons they gave for not using these services included, among
others, not needing to; fear; not believing in western medicine; and not feeling comfortable.

In comparison, 12.3 percent (17.2 percent of 15-19 year olds and 3.3 percent of 10-14 year
olds) ever used an SRH service such as FP, STI counseling, and pre-natal care. Adolescent
girls and rural areas were more likely to report using SRH services than their counterparts, while
adolescents 15-19 years of age were significantly more likely to use these services than younger
adolescents.

Of those who used SRH services, most sought services through the public health system, followed
by the private sector and the Salvadorian Institute for Social Security (ISSS) (figure 15).

Further, adolescents in rural areas were more likely to use public services than urban areas
(91.7 percent and 77.5 percent respectively). Figure 16 provides the type of SRH service
adolescents used, with medical consultations and immunizations used most often. Adolescents
15-19 years of age were more likely to use these services than those 10-14 years of age. Further,
there was a difference in use of these services based on residence. Adolescents from urban areas
were more likely to use standard medical visits in comparison to rural areas, while adolescents
from rural areas were more likely to use preventative services (figure 17).

When asked if they were satisfied with the services they received, 92.6 percent of
adolescents reported that they received the information that they needed and 66.4 percent
stated that the health care providers listened attentively when they explained their health
problems. However, 11.2 percent stated that health care providers were disrespectful; and 8.4
percent stated that providers divulged their confidential information to a third party. In addition, 48
percent of adolescents stated that health care providers asked for parental authorization, with
adolescents 10-14 years of age experiencing this more than those 15-19 years of age (76.6
percent and 33.6 percent respectively).

Of the thirteen adolescents who reported that they were sexually abused, only three (2
adolescent girls and 1 boy) stated that they received medical attention (for example,
treatment and psychological support) in a health center. Of those who did not receive health
care attention, they stated that they did not know about these services or did not want to go to the
health centers.

Among those who did not use SRH services, when asked why they did not use these
services, reasons included age (for example, they were too young); sexual inactivity; a lack of
time; not comfortable; length of waiting time; and negative attitudes from health providers; among
others.

Approximately 86 percent of girls who had given birth were satisfied with the health
services offered, while 14 percent were dissatisfied. Of those dissatisfied, 21.6 percent were
from rural areas and 3.7 percent were from urban areas. Reasons for dissatisfaction included:
poor bed-side manner, long wait times, a lack of privacy, an inability to understand the language
used by the healthcare worker, non-availability of toilets, and health complications due to medical
errors. Further, adolescents stated that administrative personnel, guards, and nurses treated them
disrespectfully.

Violence, Depression, and Discrimination

Sexual Abuse

All adolescents stated that they were against gender-based violence. When asked how to
prevent and respond to sexual violence, 94.7 percent of adolescent girls and 97.7 percent of
adolescent boys thought the best way was to report the perpetrator, while 87.4 percent of
adolescent girls and 84.3 percent of boys thought that the victim should inform someone they
know and trust. When asked what they would do if they were sexually abused, 92.7 percent of
adolescent girls and 91.1 percent of boys said that they would report the person. These opinions
were slightly more prevalent in urban areas.

(percent).

health and rights Survey: El Salvador. Survey commissioned by the World Bank.


Violence

Adolescents identified alcohol and drugs, “machismo’, and family conflict, among others,
as causative factors for violent behavior (figure 18). Adolescent girls were significantly more
likely to experience abuse than boys (13.2 percent compared to 9.3 percent respectively) and
more frequently (11.1 percent compared to 5.4 percent respectively).

Approximately 11.3 percent of adolescents stated that they were victims of abuse
(including sexual, mistreatment, and violence), of which 74 percent were 15-19 year olds
and 26 percent were 10-14 year olds. In fact, age modified being mistreated slightly, with
adolescents 15-19 years of age at a 20 percent increased risk for abuse than their younger
counterparts. They were also more likely to live in urban than rural areas. Victims stated that the
abuse included name-calling, threats, intimidation, physical violence, and being treated poorly by
the police. Regression analyses indicate that having a telephone line in the house reduced the
risk of mistreatment by 50 percent.

(percent).

Salvador. Health Focus GmbH. 2012. Data collection commissioned by the World Bank.

Adolescents reported that abusers tended to be family members; the main perpetrators of
which were fathers, followed by mothers, other family members, and stepfathers (figure
19). Furthermore, adolescents reported that pregnancy was associated with familial sexual abuse
and could lead to suicide among pregnant adolescent girls. In addition, results from the regression
analyses found that living in a household where a member was a victim of a crime in the past 6
months increased the risk of adolescent mistreatment by 64 percent.

65.5 percent stated that they told someone about the abuse, with adolescent girls more
likely to tell someone than boys (72 percent and 56.1 percent respectively). Further, when
asked whom they told, they were most likely to tell their mothers, teachers, friends, siblings, or
fathers about the abuse.

When asked if they had reported the abuse to law enforcement, 5.7 percent of 10-14 year
olds and 8.8 percent of 15-19 year olds reported that they had, with adolescent girls more
likely to report than boys (11.1 percent and 5.4 percent respectively). Although adolescents
in urban areas were more likely to tell someone that they were abused (69.6 percent and 60
percent respectively), adolescents in rural areas were more likely to report the abuse (13.3 percent
and 5.2 percent respectively). Those who reported the incident did so alone or with a close family
member (for example, mother, aunt, grandmother). They stated that they reported to one of the
following: the public prosecutor, the national civil police, the Institute for the Development of
Women, family court, attorney general’s office, court of peace, and the school director.
Adolescents stated that most often, if the perpetrator was a parent or partner, nothing happened;
for relatives, some were sent to jail while others were sent to therapy; and some complaints were
withdrawn due to parental divorce.

Among those who did not report the abuse, when asked why, most stated that they did not
know how to press charges; did not know if the incident needed to be reported; were
embarrassed; and unsure if the perpetrator would be punished. Others were afraid of the
consequences; wanted to avoid problems, as the aggressor was a family member; felt sorry for



                                                32
the perpetrator; did not want to lose privileges like going to school; said that it was not a big deal;
and preferred to forgive.

Depression

The study found that 44 percent of adolescents displayed at least one symptom of
depression, while 11.2 percent of adolescents displayed five or six symptoms. Symptoms
were significantly more common among adolescent girls and those 15-19 years of age. For
example, 27.6 percent of adolescent females and 19.4 percent of males displayed three or more
symptoms (p=0.003). Similarly, 26.1 percent of 15-19 year olds and 18.7 percent of 10-14 year
olds displayed three or more symptoms (p=0.012). Suicidal thoughts were also higher in 15-19
year olds (11.2 percent among 15-19 year olds and 9.7 percent among 10-14 year olds
respectively) and adolescent girls (14.5 percent among adolescent girls and 6.8 percent among
boys respectively). Figure 20 demonstrates the most reported symptoms.

A significant correlation was found between victims of abuse and displaying symptoms of
depression. For example 33.3 percent of abused adolescents displayed 5 or 6 symptoms of
depression compared to 8.5 percent of those who had not been abused, while 55.3 percent of
abused adolescents displayed three or more symptoms compared to 19.5 percent of those who
had not been abused.

Discrimination

The study found that adolescent girls were at a 66 percent higher risk of being
discriminated against for their sexual behaviour and identity than boys. Similarly,
adolescents in rural areas were at a 35 percent higher risk of being discriminated against than
their urban counterparts. Interestingly, living in a household where a family member was the victim
of a crime in the past 6 months doubled the risk of being discriminated against for both adolescent
boys and girls.



                                                 33
Adolescents acknowledged that discrimination existed in various forms in their
communities. In fact, groups most targeted for discrimination included homosexuals, pregnant
teenagers, persons living with HIV, single mothers, people with disabilities, senior citizens,
adolescents, and women (figure 21).

Over half of the surveyed adolescents (56.6 percent) did not discriminate against and had
positive attitudes towards homosexuals. In fact, 66.1 percent of adolescents stated that they
were comfortable around them; 64.9 percent stated that they would work with them; 18.6 percent
stated that they would defend their rights; and 12.7 percent said that they would be happy to have
a homosexual friend. These attitudes were more frequent among 10-14 year olds, adolescent
boys, and rural areas. However, 5 percent thought that homosexuals should be expelled from
school because they negatively influenced others, while 3.2 percent stated that they would not
defend them if they were bullied.

Results from the regression analyses found that knowledge about SRHR, participating in
a youth group, and households that benefitted from social programs protected adolescents
against discrimination. Interestingly, education level had no effect on risk for discrimination.

There was a statistically significant correlation between having experienced discrimination
and symptoms of depression 7 . Among the discriminated, 52.7 percent had three or more
symptoms of depression compared to 17.2 percent among those who were not victimized.

4.3.       The Government’s Efforts at Guaranteeing Adolescent SRHR

The section below describes the extent to which the government has been responsible for
guaranteeing adolescent SRH in El Salvador. It is divided by three human rights principles (as
described in the conceptual framework) including equality and non-discrimination; participation
and empowerment; and transparency and accountability. The information provided below was
collected through interviews with key stakeholders.

The study also found that LGBT individuals were exposed to high level of discrimination,
despite the government’s efforts to protect and guarantee their rights in recent years. For
example the Secretary of Social Inclusion created a unit on Sexual Diversity and passed various
policies and mandates prohibiting discrimination against these individuals. In addition, in 2009
the MOH passed a mandate to eradicate discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although the
study found that most Salvadorian adolescents show negative opinion on homosexual sexual
orientation, they did state that they were starting to understand that LGBT individuals deserved
equal rights and respect. Additionally, the study found that adolescent girls were a vulnerable
population. Salvadorian adolescents still hold traditional beliefs about gender roles. Adolescents
accept that men cannot control their sexual desire and some of them justified sexual violence
against women, if they refuse sex. Further, the government has not passed many laws that change
gender stereotypes, despite the National Policy on Women, which requires that the government
guarantee gender equality.

Participation and Empowerment

Stakeholders stated that they could not think of any programs that were developed with
adolescent participation, indicating that these programs did not empower adolescents or
reflect adolescents’ needs and desires. In fact, the government’s policies reflect, instead, what
authorities believe to be best for adolescents, which often does not coincide with adolescent needs
and desires.

Despite this setback, the government is making progress towards increasing adolescent and youth
participation in designing programs. For example, the MOE recently started a program in primary
school that teaches children about empowerment and decision making. This program includes
peer education, preventing adolescent pregnancies, and strong families. Such programs are not
the norm, however their primary role is preparing high school students for parenthood. One
program called City Woman, recommends a multi-sectorial approach to SRH activities given that
the information sessions that the MOH provides on SRH are not sufficient. Stakeholders
recommended that this approach needs to involve law enforcement, the judicial sector, women’s
groups, nongovernmental agencies, among others.

Transparency and Accountability

El Salvador has passed the following policies that provide protection for adolescent SRH,
including:

       •   The National Policy on Women, which states that the prevention of adolescent
           pregnancies requires an integrated approach using gender and human rights. This is
           headed by ISDEMU.




                                               35
    •   The National Policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights was passed in July of
        2012. It focuses on inclusion, gender, and rights and includes eight specific objectives to
        increase access to SRH though health promotion, prevention, care, and rehabilitation with
        a comprehensive primary healthcare framework.
    •   The National Policy on Youth 2011-2014 promotes an integrated approach to adolescent
        health and as a result, the Institute for Youth was created. Programs and projects with
        specified budgets that focus on adolescent SRHR have not been developed yet.

Despite these efforts, the government’s challenge is to fully operationalize all these policies. In
fact, the National Policy on Health’s Building Hope proposal recommended several SRH strategies
to the MOH including the promotion of sex and peer education programs, adolescent pregnancy
prevention, and guaranteeing adolescent SRHR, among others. Further, the government should
develop campaigns to raise awareness on challenging traditional gender stereotypes.

Through the law on Transparency, the MOH established an office on the right to health. This office
was developed to provide information to the public on the MOH’s work and file complaints if
necessary. Also, the Minister attends meetings in which the public can pose questions. The aim
of the office is to foster a culture of transparency and accountability. However, all stakeholders
stated that adolescent SRHR has hardly been discussed at meetings. In addition, all stakeholders
agreed that they did not know how the government monitored SRHR enforcement or evaluated
the impact of these laws and policies. The only monitoring that was noted was a color system
used by health managers to determine if their jurisdictions were meeting MDG5, reducing the
maternal mortality rate (associated with a woman’s right to health). In terms of impact evaluations,
stakeholders thought that the government should promote and conduct impact evaluation analysis
of school sex education programs in order to understand why so many adolescents have become
pregnant in El Salvador.

            5.      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1     Conclusions

The study confirms the mulitsectorality and complexity of adolescent SRH in El Salvador,
indicating a need for coordinated efforts between the MOH and the MOE, the Ministry of Labour,
and the Ministry of Social Protection.

Given that most adolescents were unaware of or able to exercise their SRHR, particularly
their rights to reproductive health, education, equality, freedom from sexual violence, and
protection of minors, this demonstrates that policymakers need to implement, educate, and
enforce these policies.

In addition to developing policies on adolescent pregnancy prevention, policies should
focus on gender equity. For example, adolescent girls are more likely to abandon school, have
unplanned pregnancies, and suffer from abuse. Although the MOE has passed a policy on
preventing schools from expelling pregnant adolescents, most of the adolescent girls interviewed
stated that they decided to leave school once they became pregnant. Similar results were found
with adolescent fathers, stating that they had to abandon school in order to financially provide for
their families. This provides evidence that policy makers need to ensure that these adolescents
do not abandon school and are provided an opportunity for re-entry once the child has been born.

The government has a mandate to protect the most vulnerable and is also required to
enforce the right to equality and non-discrimination. Despite this mandate and the
government’s efforts to prevent mental, physical, and sexual abuse (through the ratification of the
Convention of Belem do Para, developing the Salvadorian Institute for the Development of
Women, and passing the Special Integrated Law for Women’s Access to Life without Violence), a
significant proportion of adolescents continue to experience violence. Given that male dominance
and aggression persist without sufficient penalization, adolescents lack trust in the public and legal
systems. Ultimately, the findings from the quantitative and focus groups surveys show that the
right to protect and assist minors is not being fully guaranteed.

Moreover, the study found that many LGBT rights were not guaranteed and the majority of
adolescents expressed some negative attitudes against LGBT. In 2009 the MOH passed a
law that prohibits any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
demonstrating that the MOH is working to change these attitudes.

The right to information on SRHR implies that the material given to adolescents is
appropriate and correct, however, this right was not fully guaranteed in El Salvador. For
example, adolescents 10-14 years of age were significantly less likely to receive information on
SRHR than their older counterparts. This has implications for their future in that these adolescents
are experiencing puberty and are unaware of the risks they are exposed to. Policymakers need to
ensure that these adolescents are being reached. Further, the information given to adolescents
15-19 years of age was not correct. Many were told that masturbation is bad and that oral
contraceptives are not healthy. Importantly, although information is essential it is not the solution
to all problems. For instance, international evidence as well as the statistical analyses done for
this study, indicate that merely providing adolescents information on SRHR has no impact in
reducing adolescent pregnancy – although it is the first step towards empowerment.



                                                 37
The right to information also includes the dissemination of appropriate information through
the media. However, the government’s efforts at regulating the media have not been enforced.
Most adolescents stated that the media promoted risky sexual behaviors and a hyper-sexualized
culture. Further, all adolescents stated that they had not been informed about their SRHR through
the media.

The right to privacy and family signify parental responsibilities. The study found that most
pregnant adolescents have few options but to give birth and raise their children. However,
adolescent boys who become fathers can decide whether they want to care for the child. This
demonstrates that adolescent fathers are not conscious of their parental responsibilities. This
violates international standards, and the government should enforce laws that require fathers to
share parental responsibilities (Convention on the Right of the Child, Article 18 8).

When examining the right to a happy adolescence, according to the study adolescence was
not an important stage of life among El Salvadorians. For example, many adolescents stated
that they were discriminated against and seen as troublemakers within their community. It also
indicates that young people are not given many opportunities to reach their full potential and
become respected members of society. If parents and society do not approve of adolescent
pregnancies, then adolescent boys and girls need to be better informed about sex and provided
access to contraception and SRH services and empowered to take control of their bodies and
lives.

In addition, adolescent girls are more likely to face stigma and discrimination due to
traditional gender roles in El Salvador, which contributes to their vulnerability. For example,
all adolescents identified becoming a woman as being a mother. Further, adolescents identified
that there were few options for young people to develop as individuals, which may explain why
most adolescent mothers easily accept their pregnancies.

A third of adolescents belong to a youth group, with adolescent boys more active in sports
and girls more active in churches. Upon further analysis, participation in youth groups does
have a positive effect; therefore communities should involve adolescents and youth in the
development of youth-friendly services and engage them politically, socially, and culturally.

Social security coverage is low among adolescent mothers indicating a need for coverage
among this group. However, adolescent mothers stated that they were satisfied with the maternal
and child health services they received. Further, adolescent girls were protected and guaranteed
under the right to an adequate standard of living. Indeed, a pregnant adolescent is considered to
be of high obstetrical and perinatal risk and is entitled to comprehensive medical care through the
public health system.

The right to health for adolescents is partially guaranteed in El Salvador. The study found
that the greatest criticism of health services was a lack of adolescent-friendly health services. As
a result, many adolescents were not provided with or seeking SRH services. In addition, the right
to life is a controversial topic in El Salvador as abortions are illegal. The study was unable to
discuss this topic in depth with adolescents.

5.2     Recommendations

The following section provides recommendations by sector to improve adolescent SRH and SRHR
in El Salvador. They are multi-sectorial challenges that require the collaboration of all sectors.

Ministry of Education

Given the importance that education plays in an adolescent’s life in terms of sexual and
reproductive health, impact evaluations on sex educations courses should be conducted
in order to determine impact and quality of course. It is recommended that programs include
topics such as SRH, SRHR, gender, life plans, contraception, FP, sexuality, sexual identity, and
sexual diversity. According to the study, it found that less than half of the adolescents in school
are exposed to such classes. Further, these programs could progressively be introduced into
health education courses, which start in the 5th grade. These educational courses, though, should
be introduced at a younger age, as most adolescents are sexually active by the time they learn
about sex education in school.

Acceptance and non-discrimination of sexual identity and sexual diversity should also be
taught in sex education courses. Given that the study found that many adolescents had
homophobic attitudes, these topics need to be covered in order to help change behaviors and
attitudes and to establish a more accepting community. Schools should also consider providing
sex education courses for parents so that they can empower their children and teach them sex
education correctly.

It is important that the Ministry promote educational rights, empower adolescents, and
change traditional perceptions of gender roles. This includes building self-esteem among
adolescent girls, which could potentially prevent adolescent pregnancies. As the study found, most
adolescents thought that a female’s primary role was to become a mother. Courses need to be
offered in primary and secondary school that empower adolescent females, teaching them that
they deserve respect and that they can assume other roles in life. Schools also must reinforce the
importance of adolescence as a key stage in life that should include studies, the enjoyment of life,
puberty, and reflecting on their aspirations and goals in life.

The MOE should also monitor pregnant adolescents, ensuring that they stay in school,
even when they become pregnant. If they leave school, the MOE needs understand why so that
pregnant adolescents stop abandoning school. They also need to ensure that they have programs
for re-entry into school for the mother once the child has been born.

Ministry of Health

For the most part, the MOH has been successful at providing and disseminating
information on adolescent SRH. Approximately 86 percent of pregnant adolescents stated that
they were satisfied with the maternal care provided by the public health system. Adolescents also
stated that the Ministry disseminates information on SRHR topics such as sexuality, STIs,
contraception, and FP in health centers and schools.




                                                39
The MOH, however, still faces challenges and needs to ensure the following:
    • To better coordinate adolescent SRHR institutional efforts and policy enforcement
    • To better communicate the SRH services offered to adolescents
    • To ensure that health services are adolescent-friendly and that health care providers are
      trained and sensitive to adolescent SRH needs

As found in the study, most adolescents thought that they could not receive effective
counseling about contraception at health centers. This was illustrated by low contraceptive
use among adolescents as well as a lack of knowledge about contraception. Further, adolescents
stated that they did not use the health centers when they found out they had an STI. In order to
improve upon these health outcomes, the MOH needs to raise awareness among adolescents,
families, and communities on the importance of contraception, STIs, and effective health
counseling at health centers through campaigns and programs. It also needs to monitor
adolescents’ right to privacy and confidentiality in health centers, ensuring that health care
providers are following protocol to protect these young people.

Adolescent and Youth Programs

The study found that there were insufficient adolescent SRHR programs while adolescents
and stakeholders reported that all of the programs had been designed without the
participation of adolescents and youth. The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and other
sectors, therefore, need to ensure that when developing programs for adolescents on SRHR, they
need to involve adolescents and youth in the process. For example, given that the study found
that 12 percent of adolescent girls had given birth, adolescent and youth programs could focus on
pregnancy prevention and safe SRH lifestyles. Further adolescents reported not having much
respect within their community, and programs could focus on adolescent empowerment and
making responsible decisions.

These programs could be funded by various sectors including the National Council on
Childhood and Adolescence (CONNA). One project that CONNA could develop is a website for
adolescents on SRHR so that adolescents could send anonymous questions to experts about their
SRH and SRHR. Another proposed program could be a toll-free hotline for adolescents who are
victims of sexual abuse and other serious problems. Importantly, these programs should be broad
enough and focus on youth empowerment and participation in the process.

Relevant Governmental Bodies

Although the Law of Transparency is a step in the right direction, the government needs to
more rigorously enforce human rights. Adolescent girls should be fully protected from sexual
violence. In order to do this, law enforcement, the Attorney General, and social services, among
other key stakeholders all must work together to play a greater role.

The aim of the study is to understand the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behavior and determinants among
adolescents in El Salvador using data from a survey of 1,258 adolescents’ aged 10-19 and 12 interviews with
representatives from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) and UN agencies. The study found that adolescents were not educated enough on their sexual and
reproductive health rights (SRHR), and have limited use of and access to contraceptives. Alcohol and violence were
found to be associated with risky sexual behavior, requiring a multisectoral response from the government and civil
society. Adolescents need to receive earlier and more accurate information on their sexual and reproductive health
rights (SRHR); and this information should be disseminated in a way that empowers adolescents to make responsible
decisions about their sexual reproductive health. The MOE could play a vital role in informing adolescents in this area,
and adjust these programs when necessary. Further, the role of parents is critical, as the study found that adolescents
are not receiving adequate and enough SRHR information from their parents. In addition, the MOH needs to offer
adolescent-friendly health services, which includes trained health personnel. Although adolescents stated that the
maternal and child health programs offered were satisfactory and the government has made an effort at educating
adolescents on HIV/AIDS, both the promotion of contraceptive methods and monitoring adolescent SRHR remain as
key challenges to be addressed by multisectoral interventions.
