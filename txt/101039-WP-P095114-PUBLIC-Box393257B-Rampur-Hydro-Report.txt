   Improvement in the Living Standards
   An end-term impact evaluation was undertaken by the project through independent consultants in December
   2014. The objective of the evaluation to capture the effect implementation of land acquisition, resettlement
   and community development activities had on the project beneficiaries. The evaluation revealed:
   (i)	 the average income of project-affected families has increased by more than 50 percent in real terms
          over baseline incomes and is 86 percent more than the average income of the control set of population;
   (ii)	 more than 50 percent of the affected people have added additional household assets or immovable
          assets such as land or house from the compensation amounts received by them;
   (iii)	 the proportion of people working in fixed earning income jobs has increased by around 25 percent
          from the baseline;
   (iv)	 the housing conditions of the affected people have substantially improved. For example, average
          size of the house is now 70 percent bigger than the baseline average size and more than double the
          control set population’s size of houses;
   (v)	 female literacy increased by 7 percent to 83 percent from the baseline level of 76 percent;
   (vi)	 average spending on food items increased by about 15 percent and is 20 percent more than the
          control set of population;
   (vii)	 compensation amounts have been used productively - Around 20 percent invested compensation
          amounts for land purchase and about 60 households made investments in the form of Bank fixed
          deposits, and mutual funds; and
   (viii)	the project-affected people identified support for technical education, merit scholarships, dispensary at
          Bayal and mobile health van, to be good initiatives by SJVNL in assisting the affected people and local
          people in their efforts towards improving the access to basic amenities and health and education facilities.

The project is located in a hilly terrain about 130 kms
from state capital of Shimla and situated on the bank
of River Sutlej. Being a hilly and remote region and far
away from the state capital, there were limited market
registered transactions which provided limited basis
for determination of realistic land values. A District

in December 2005 with the Deputy Commissioner
as Chairman and senior representatives of key

“…The earlier house had four rooms and a toilet, permanent but smaller. After land acquisition, SJVNL gave
us a plot for our resettlement. Actually, the plot is only 100 meters away from our earlier home. We continue
to get fodder for our cattle from the nearby forest… so no change. …... This is the new house that we have
constructed. It has four rooms but as you can see they are bigger than earlier… with a toilet. Water supply is
available for 24 hours. SJVNL has provided street lighting and recently set up a sewage treatment plant for the
colony… definitely an improvement on what we had earlier. You would notice we are now constructing the first
floor… more members in the household means need for more space!”

Petty contracts: SJVNL awarded petty contracts                       By employing local people, the contractors substantially
(below Rs. 1.0 million or ~US$ 18,180) such                          increased local work opportunities. Petty contracts
as housekeeping, gardening and masonry for                           were tendered and awarded to registered agencies
infrastructure on a preferential basis to local people               submitting the lowest bid. The duration of such

local people, of which Rs. 202.30 million (~US$ 3.68
million) worth works (60 percent) have been completed.
Besides, the major project contractors have awarded 84
petty contracts worth Rs. 40.4 million (US$ 0.73 million).

Employment of local persons by contractors:
SJVNL engaged local persons on annual contracts
through various contractors, thereby increasing local
employment for clerks, supervisors and data entry
operators on pay scales ranging between Rs. 3,000
and 8,000 (~US$ 55-145) per month. In addition, 444
local people including 25 project-affected persons
were employed by contractors on long-term contracts.
With this experience and income, these entrants
have been able to pursue higher studies and other
professional interests. Although a state-of-the-art
hydropower project like the Rampur one has only
limited manpower needs, SJVNL has stipulated that
“one member of each project affected family rendered

I work with the finance department of RHP and live in Kasholi village of Badi panchayat i.e. within the project-
affected area, but not directly affected. When RHP introduced this scheme of hiring of vehicles for families
residing in the project-affected area, I considered it as a good opportunity to earn more money. …I purchased
a Mahindra Bolero vehicle on loan and rented it out to RHP in 2011. I get Rs. 18,000 (~US$ 327) as a fixed
rate and with fuel and other expenses it is about Rs. 27,000 (~US$ 491) per month. Part of the earnings goes
towards loan repayment and driver’s salary. Money earned has been good and enabled me to afford more.
My son is enrolled in GNIIT – computer course from an accredited institute. Also, once the loan amount is
cleared, I get the vehicle for free. If I sell it, I will get at least Rs. 1,50,000 (~US$ 2,727).

raised to Rs. 307.5 million (~US$ 5.6 million). Since
2009, the LADC has sanctioned, executed and
monitored infrastructure improvement schemes under
this allocation in the affected villages, including:

Infrastructure works: Rs. 480 million (~US$ 8.7
million) have been spent by the project on improving
infrastructure, including on two major works, namely a
new bus station (Rs.114 million or ~US$ 2.07 million)
and a senior secondary school (Rs. 20 million or ~US$
0.36 million) at Rampur. In addition, SJVNL has also
installed energized tube wells and hand pumps for
improving drinking water supply. Based on ranking
parameters (see Box 4), the funds are earmarked
for each affected village to support the provision of

“..there was a Primary Health Center at Koyal village… but we still travelled to Khaneri or Rampur. The bus fare
apart, half a day would be required in terms of time, causing discomfort to the patient. Now with the health vans
coming and holding camps and check-up of patients, we get treatment and free medicines ….at our doorstep!

the threshold of one million rupees (~US$ 18,180) is
allocable for local petty contracts, those interested
could submit their bids.

Mobile health vans and medical camps: Prior to
the project, the nearest medical facility for local
communities was at Khaneri or Rampur, approximately
8-10 km away. Inadequate transportation rendered
access difficult. Medical camps and mobile health
vans became operational in January 2005, comprising
a team of doctors, nurses and attendants that visits
villages thrice weekly for one hour per village, also
providing treatment and referral services to villages in
the neighbourhood.

Mobile health vans and medical camps help diagnose
patients, provide medicines free of cost, medical
guidance and referrals. This has increased awareness
about basic hygiene and balanced diet in the

…the Rampur project has supported the schools in the area in many ways. We have used the grant scheme for
purchasing science, chemistry instruments, books for the library, furniture, tables, chairs, basketball, volleyball…
sports goods…and yes, we developed a basketball court. We also get grants from the state government... it
comes through…sometimes takes longer. The project gave scholarships to encourage good students… there
was an essay, quiz and declamation competition too….Recently in February; the project organized a dental,
blood grouping camp …in our school... very useful. Actually otherwise it is very difficult for the school to organize
such a camp. The panchayat is involved as well in the functioning….the school management committee includes
a panchayat representative, parents of wards and they monitor the grant utilization, the assessment committee is
working well

   Given the location of project in an underdeveloped area with limited availability of good quality medical facilities, SJVNL commissioned its
first mobile health van in 2000 which: (i) visited affected villages four days a week and provided consultation and medicines; (ii) organized
medical camps at schools and villages; (iii) afforded easy access and extra diagnostic facilities and free medicines for residents; and (iv)
helped improve health status and awareness of preventive practices for common ailments.
