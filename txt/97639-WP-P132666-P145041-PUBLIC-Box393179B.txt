This note presents 9 stylized facts that emerge related to the evolution of poverty between 2008 and 2012 in
Albania. Findings from this note, using the latest Living Standard Measurement Study (2012 LSMS), show
that the sharp downward poverty trend observed in the first part of the 2000s halted with the global economic
crisis (Stylized fact 1). From a period of fast economic growth up to 2008, growth slowed down, labor
markets weakened and remittances inflows declined sharply in Albania, resulting in a stagnant national
poverty rate. Between 2008 and 2012, poverty increased in urban areas, narrowing poverty differences
between urban and rural areas (Stylized Fact 2). Poverty increased in most regions particularly the Coastal
region (Stylized fact 3). Not surprisingly, poverty is higher among households with low-educated members
and a larger number of members. In the period under study, poverty increased particularly among household
with older workers and youth, and the secondary-educated (Stylized Fact 4). Although poverty at the national
level remained largely unchanged, this masks significant movements in and out of poverty that point to
vulnerability of the non-poor in Albania (Stylized fact 5). In fact, the observed decline in inequality in the
period 2008 to 2012 is driven by stronger consumption decline of those in the highest quintile (Stylized fact
6).

The analysis suggests that lower economic growth was the main driver of the poverty trend (Stylized fact 7).
In particular, weakened labor markets are behind poverty changes (Stylized fact 8), mainly through job loss,
while pensions and social assistance partly offset the labor market shock (Stylized fact 9).

Worryingly, labor markets have further deteriorated beyond 2012, and Albania faces multiple structural labor
market challenges, with the low quality of jobs being a particularly salient issue.1 However, knowledge gaps
remain in terms of understanding the constraints to more and better jobs in Albania. As growth and
employment pick up in Albania, it is critical to further explore the constraints to more and better jobs so as
to boost the capacity of households to generate market income and resume the downward poverty trend.
Improving the ability to monitor poverty more frequently is also key for Albania.

INTRODUCTION

Albania was a fast growing economy in the 2000s. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an
average annual rate of 6 percent in real terms, and Albania moved from being one of the poorest countries
in Europe in the early 1990s, to reaching middle-income status in 2008 (Figure 1). The construction and
services sectors were the main drivers of economic and employment growth in 2000–2008 (accounting for
nearly three-quarters of growth), and significant reallocation of resources took place from rural agriculture
to construction and services.

The global economic crisis slowed down Albania’s economic growth. After the global economic crisis
hit, with significant impacts across the Western Balkans (Figure 2), economic growth slowed down
significantly and persistently in Albania, linked to the Eurozone crisis and particularly to the economic
performance of Greece and Italy. The region suffered another hit in 2012 (“double-dip” recession) as it
struggled toward recovery and had negative impacts from climatic shocks; economic growth in Albania
decelerated further. Inflation remained moderate over the period before and after the global economic crisis
(below 3 percent on average from 2002 to 2012 2 ), but the labor market suffered during the economic
downturn and adjusted mainly through job loss instead of wages. Today, employment rates in Albania remain
low compared to the region, but the highest among the Western Balkans (Figure 3).

This note presents 9 stylized facts that emerge related to the evolution of poverty and inequality
over the 2002 to 2012 period, especially from 2008 to 2012, as well as some insights into the drivers of
poverty changes. It complements existing work on monitoring and understanding shared prosperity – the
second corporate goal of the World Bank along with reducing poverty - in Albania and the Western Balkans.3
Albania poverty estimates are based on the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS). The LSMS is
conducted by the Albania Statistics Office (INSTAT) with donor funding and has been carried out in 2002,
2005, 2008 and recently in 2012. The 2012 round provides an opportunity to update poverty estimates and

analysis since 2008, capturing the effects on poverty of the global economic crisis and lower economic growth
in the country that in the first part of the decade.4

Findings from this note show that downward poverty trends in the first part of the 2000s halted in
Albania between 2008 and 2012. Increases took place particularly in urban areas, narrowing poverty
differences between urban and rural areas. Poverty changes were driven mostly by changes in mean
consumption growth. This analysis suggests that lower economic growth and particularly weakened labor
markets were drivers of poverty increases, while pensions and social assistance partly offset the labor market
shock. Specifically, decomposing household income growth and poverty changes by different sources of
income suggests that labor markets were a key channel for poverty changes during the shock, mainly from
job loss. In addition, pensions increased considerably over the period partly mitigating the crisis effects on
poverty, together with social assistance income.

The stylized facts behind these findings are the following:

         Stylized fact 1: the decreasing poverty trend of the 2000s in Albania reversed from 2008 to 2012
         Stylized fact 2: poverty increased in urban areas, narrowing urban-rural poverty differences
         Stylized fact 3: poverty increased in most regions, particularly in the coastal region where previous
          gains were largely eroded
         Stylized fact 4: poverty increased particularly among older workers and youth, and the secondary-
          educated
         Stylized fact 5: small observed poverty changes mask large movements in and out of poverty
         Stylized fact 6: inequality declined, from larger consumption fall at the top
         Stylized fact 7: weak economic growth drove poverty increases
         Stylized fact 8: weakened labor markets as a channel for poverty increases
         Stylized fact 9: social protection, particularly pensions, contributed to mitigating the labor market
          shock; remittances flows shrank

The rest of the note presents trends and evidence supporting each of these using the LSMS data from 2002,
2005, 2008 and 2012, with a stronger focus on the latest round. Findings presented here are complemented
with two accompanying notes on labor markets in Albania using the Labor Force Survey, and on gender and
access to economic opportunities using the LSMS.




4Official Poverty estimates for Albania are produced by the Albania Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) using data from the Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS). Poverty is based on total per-capita household consumption, regionally deflated. The poverty line has been
estimated following the cost of basic needs methodology. The food poverty line or extreme poverty line was set at 3,047 LEK per month,
whereas the poverty line has been set at 4,891 LEK in 2002 prices. This note focuses on the poverty line, given that poverty at the extreme
poverty line is very low at 2.2 percent in 2012 (going from 5 percent in 2002, to 3.5 percent in 2005, to 1.2 percent in 2008). The poverty line in
2012 prices is 6,407.21Lek per month, which corresponds to about 3.12 US$ in 2005 PPP.

THE EVOLUTION OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY IN ALBANIA


     STYLIZED FACT 1: THE DECREASING POVERTY TREND OF THE 2000S
                 IN ALBANIA HALTED FROM 2008 TO 2012

The decreasing poverty trend observed from 2002 to 2008 in Albania halted between 2008 and 2012.
Following a substantial decrease in poverty from 25.4 percent to 12.5 percent up to the global economic
crisis (2002-2008), poverty slightly increased between 2008 and 2012 from 12.5 percent to 14.3 percent,
although increases are not statistically significant.5 In addition, the average shortfall from the poverty line
became deeper (poverty gap) and inequality among the poor (squared poverty gap) increased (Figure 4). The
slight increase in poverty in the recent period is robust to any choice of poverty line: as shown in Figure A1,
regardless of the threshold, poverty was higher in 2002 than in 2005, and higher in 2012 than in 2008.

              STYLIZED FACT 2: POVERTY INCREASED IN URBAN AREAS,
                NARROWING URBAN-RURAL POVERTY DIFFERENCES

Poverty increases were more pronounced in urban areas, narrowing urban-rural poverty differences.
The overall poverty increase observed in Albania from 2008 to 2012 was driven by a statistically significant
increase of more than three percentage points of urban poverty6 which, coupled with the large gains in

6   Significant at the 10 percent level.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              9
poverty reduction in rural areas from 2005 to 2008, reduced significantly the urban-rural poverty divide
compared to 2005 (Figure 7). Poverty rates in 2012 were higher than in 2005 (13.6 percent as opposed to
11.2 percent), reversing a slight gain for urban areas in the second half of the 2000s. In line with the national
trend, the severity and depth of poverty increased in both urban and rural areas, but more so in the former
(Table A1). In recent years (2008-2012), the urban population grew from 50 percent to 54 percent of the
total population, and the concentration of poor became nearly evenly distributed between urban and rural
areas given a large increase in the poor in urban areas (Figure 8).

In line with poverty changes, household expenditures fell with a particularly pronounced drop in
urban areas. The two percent increase in overall poverty between 2012 and 2008 is associated to a 5 percent
mean reduction in total per capita expenditure. This contraction in consumption was higher in urban areas
(-9 percent) than rural areas (-3 percent) (Figure 9). The second quintile of the population was the most
affected (Table A2).

     STYLIZED FACT 3: POVERTY INCREASED IN MOST REGIONS,
  PARTICULARLY IN THE COASTAL REGION WHERE PREVIOUS GAINS
                    WERE LARGELY ERODED

Poverty increased within all regions except mountain areas, which experienced a considerable
decline in poverty. In Tirana and in the Coastal regions not only did poverty increase in 2012 with respect
to 2008, but it reached higher levels than in 2005. In 2012 the incidence of poverty was higher among
individuals living in Coastal region, where 17.6 percent of the population was living below the poverty line
(see Figure 10 and Table A3). The mountain areas experienced a sharp decline in poverty (from 27 percent
in 2008 to 15 percent in 2012), despite a quite stable population share (from 8.3 percent in 2008 to 9.2 percent
in 2012); it remains, however, the second poorest region in Albania. More insights are nevertheless needed
to understand the drivers of poverty changes in this region.

The concentration of poor people has increased in the Coastal region. The Coastal region has
accounted for 31 percent of the total population over the decade (2002 to 2012), while the relative
contribution to poverty increased going from 25 percent in 2002, to 27 percent in 2005, to 32 percent in
2008 and 38 percent in 2012. In 2012, therefore, the Coastal region accounts for a larger share of poor
individuals than the Central region, which is the most populous area with 42 percent of total population
(Figure 11).

      HOUSEHOLDS WITH OLDER WORKERS AND YOUTH, AND THE
                       SECONDARY-EDUCATED

Poor households seem to have a higher share of youth and older people. The 15 percent increase in
poverty (or 2 percentage points) has hit in particular households that concentrate mature working-age adults
(age 50 to 64) - who bore a 73 percent increase in poverty with respect to 2008 - and youth (age 15-24) where
the incidence of poverty increased by 24 percent (Table 1).

Nevertheless, the poor among younger age groups accounts for a higher share of the total poor.
This is partly explained by a higher share of children and youth in the total population, observed in the age
and gender population pyramid. Interestingly, the population pyramids evidence a missing population
group between the ages of 30 and 40 years, likely linked to migration (Figure 14): around 2.8 percent of the
Albanian population was estimated to be an international migrant in 2010.7

Average levels of education increased during the 2000s in Albania. During the period 2002-2012
average educational attainment improved: the share of individuals aged 25 or more who attained tertiary
education increased by 75 percent over the 2000s, from 8 percent in 2002 to 14 percent in 2012. At the same
time, there are 4 percentage points fewer individuals with at most incomplete primary education, and general
secondary education became more important with respect to vocational types of secondary schools (see
Figure 15).

Not surprisingly, education levels are negatively related to poverty. The incidence of poverty is highest
in households in which the head have none or incomplete primary education at 18 percent (Figure 16 and
Table A6). Conversely, poverty levels are lowest for individuals headed by someone who attained tertiary
education at 2 percent in 2012. The increase in poverty in the years 2008-2012 has affected all individuals,
regardless of the education level of the household head. Nevertheless, individuals with secondary education
seem to have been particularly hit.

On average, 66 percent of poor individuals live in households where the head has no education of incomplete
primary education, as opposed to 45 percent of individuals in the top 60 percent of the distribution. On the
other hand, only 2 percent of poor individuals live in households where the head has tertiary education, as
opposed to 16 percent of individuals in the top three quintiles (Figure 16, right panel).

40 percent live in households about as numerous as the poor’ (see Figure 17). Only a minority of households
are female-headed in Albania, so profiling on this characteristics might be less relevant. As Figure 18 shows,
at most 10 percent of individuals in the top three quintiles and in urban settlements live in female-headed
household. For poor individuals, in rural settlements 7 percent live in female-headed households, and only 5
percent of those living in urban settlements.

STYLIZED FACT 5: SMALL OBSERVED POVERTY CHANGES MASK LARGE
             MOVEMENTS IN AND OUT OF POVERTY

Even if overall poverty did not increase significantly over the period, economic mobility analysis
suggest high churning. Using the synthetic panel methodology 8 to explore movements in and out of
poverty over the period, results show that around 15 percent of households, both in 2005-2008 and in 2008-
2012, changed socio-economic status (falling into poverty or escaping poverty) (Figure 19). However, while
around 7 percent of households escaped poverty in the recent period, around 8 percent of non-poor
households fell into poverty (in net resulting in very small poverty changes). In 2005 and 2008, although
movements out of poverty more than offset movements into poverty – thus resulting in poverty decreases
overall – vulnerability was still present with 10 percent of poor households escaping poverty, while around
five percent of the non-poor fell into poverty. Table 2 shows the full transition matrices of movements in
and out of poverty in the two periods estimated using the abovementioned method, given the lack of panel
data for Albania.




8The synthetic panel methodology builds on an imputation methodology to construct synthetic panel data with predicted consumption using
two different rounds of cross sections. The approach relies on time- invariant individual and household characteristics, and makes assumptions
on the error structure. For more details see Dang et al. (2014) on synthetic panels using point estimates.

           STYLIZED FACT 6: INEQUALITY DECLINED, FROM LARGER
                     CONSUMPTION FALL AT THE TOP

Between 2008 and 2012 inequality declined. The Gini index went from 28.2 in 2008 to 26.9 in 2012
(Figure 20), as consumption expenditures of those at the top of the distribution declined more sharply than
for others (Table A2). Other measures of inequality shows the same path of inequality overtime. Tirana
remains the region with higher inequality, with a Gini index of 28.4, even if inequality fell more sharply in
this region. Inequality – measured with the Theil index – is almost fully explained by inequality within regions.

The decline in inequality resulted from a larger decline in consumption for the well-off, compared
to the rest of the population. The incidence of growth across the consumption distribution was different
pre and post crisis, and in urban and rural areas. Pre-crisis, as Figure 21 shows, the growth rate of the bottom
quintiles was higher than the growth rate of the rest of the distribution; in other words, growth benefitted
disproportionately more the poor and less well-off resulting in a good performance in shared prosperity. In
the period 2008 to 2012, which covers the global economic crisis, consumption growth is negative for all
groups and more so for those in the highest quintile (Figure 22 and Table A2), which is behind the falling
inequality.

Economic growth decelerated significantly following the global economic crisis. The GDP per capita
growth rate suddenly dropped from 7.5 percent in 2008 to 3.4 percent in one year, and in 2013 it showed a
merely 1.4 percent growth of the economy (Figure 23). Household consumption from National Accounts
shows an even more serious deceleration, consistent with the negative consumption growth rates captured
in the LSMS.

In the period under study, the construction sector was the most affected by the economic downturn.
While growth rates for other sectors were modest but positive, the construction sector shrank by around 9
percent annually from 2008 to 2012. The share of the sector in GDP fell from 16 percent to 10 percent over
the period (Figure 24). These sectoral patterns are consistent with an increase in urban poverty – as
construction is usually concentrated in urban areas and is a labour-intensive sector. In 2009, 10 percent of
the total employed in Albania (mostly males) worked in the construction sector. This represented around
114,882 jobs. By 2011, this number had gone down to 94,488 workers. The large majority of workers are in
the agriculture sector (around 45 percent pre crisis, 2008) – mostly concentrated in rural areas – which
experienced modest but positive growth rates over the period.9

Changes in mean consumption growth, not changes in inequality, drove poverty increases between
2008 and 2012. Decomposing poverty changes into those attributed to growth and redistribution shows that
the shift in mean growth was poverty-enhancing (pushing poverty up by 3.95 percentage points), and were
not fully offset by changes in the shape of the distribution. The growth effect was stronger in urban areas
than in rural areas (Figure 25).

In the first part of the 2000s, however, both changes in mean growth and redistribution contributed
to the downward trend in poverty, mainly driven by growth. When compared to what happened in the
previous period (2002-2008), data (Figure 25) shows that the thirteen percentage points reduction in poverty
can be attributed to growth primarily (-11 percentage points, 84 percent of the change), while a relatively
smaller but poverty-reducing share to redistribution (-2 percentage points, 16 percent of the change). This
pattern is similar in both rural and urban areas, although the distribution effect was relatively stronger for
urban areas (21 percent of the change compared to 14 percent in rural areas).

     STYLIZED FACT 8: WEAKENED LABOR MARKETS AS A CHANNEL FOR
                         POVERTY INCREASES

Labor markets weakened during the global economic crisis of 2009. With the slowdown in economic
growth, employment rates declined, both from higher inactivity and unemployment rates.10 The results here
focus on labor market outcomes derived from the LSMS. Some data issues emerge when measuring labor
market activity with the LSMS, particularly in 2012, which could introduce bias to the results. Nevertheless,
the overall shock to labor markets is validated with LFS data. 11

The share of households with an unemployed or inactive (non-retired) head increased in Albania
between 2008 and 2012. Particularly, the share of heads in unemployment rose from around 3 to 12 percent
over the period (Figure 26); similarly, a large share of household heads became inactive (from 7 to around
14 percent). This is partly due to a sharp decline in people working as own-account and unpaid family workers
during the economic downturn. In tandem with a deterioration in labor market outcomes of household
heads, the share of the total population (15 years and older) in unemployment and inactivity increased from
4 percent to 12 percent, and from 17 percent to 28 percent, respectively (see Table A7).




10 See Albania labor market note based on the LFS, produced by the Poverty Global Practice.
11 Some potential data challenges related to changes in survey fieldwork need to be highlighted. The 2012 LSMS was carried out
in the Fall of 2012, while previous rounds carried out the data collection in the Spring. The impact of this change on key indicators
is not fully established. The extent to which it affects the consumption aggregate and poverty rates cannot be determined; however,
under the assumption of consumption smoothing, it could be relatively less than other more seasonal indicators such as labor
market outcomes (including labor income). Is this is the case, some sharp changes in labor market outcomes observed between
2008 and 2012 could be partly explained by fieldwork changes rather than true trends in the economy. Nevertheless, the overall
shock to labor markets is validated with LFS data in the Albania labor market note (2015) produced by the Poverty Global Practice.

Along with a higher share of unemployed and inactive household heads in Albania, the
concentration of the poor increased dramatically in households with these categories. Of the total
number of poor in the country, 19 percent are in households with an unemployed head - the highest of the
decade and in contrast to around 4 percent in 2008 - and 25 percent in households with a head out of the
labor force (not retired) (Table 3). In 2002, in turn, the highest concentration of the poor was among the
self-employed (44 percent), dropping sharply by 2012 (17 percent). Similarly, of the poor population 15 years
and older, more were concentrated among the unemployed and inactive in 2012, compared to 2008.

Accordingly, poverty is significantly higher in households with an unemployed or inactive head.
Individuals living in household where the household head is occupied (either employed or self-employed) or
retired are less likely to be poor than individuals living in households headed by unemployed or inactive

                                                                                                                                             24
(Table 4). In 2012, in fact, the incidence of poverty in households with an employed or retired head was,
respectively, 11 percent and 13 percent as opposed to 22 and 24 percent, in turn, for households with
unemployed and inactive heads. Between 2008 and 2012 the incidence of poverty has increased by 5
percentage points among individuals living in household headed by unemployed individuals, while it
decreased by 2 percentage points among individuals whose household head was self-employed. Among
employees, public sector workers have significantly lower poverty rates (see Table A8).

Not surprisingly, employment played an important role in poverty changes. Although capturing
income is not the focus of the LSMS and welfare is measured using consumption data, utilizing the available
data on income, with caveats in mind12, could point to some insights on poverty changes. Decomposing
poverty by income source shows opposite trends in the factors behind poverty reduction between 2005-2008
and 2008-2012. From 2005 to 2008 poverty reduction was led by favourable changes in labor income – from
a combination of higher wages/earnings, and higher numbers of adults and employed adults in the household
– and changes in pensions. From 2008 to 2012, the loss of jobs (“shared of employed”) is a key factor behind
poverty trends with a poverty-increasing effect (Figure 27). Looking at growth in household income shows
a similar pattern (Figure 28), with job loss across quintiles. Increases in wages/earnings were particularly
relevant for income growth of those in the lowest quintiles in that period (Figure 28, panel a). Poverty
decomposition results show that wages/earnings continued contributing to poverty reduction, signalling that
the labor market adjusted in quantities during the crisis.




12Income is not the best proxy for welfare in a country like Albania with very high informality and a large agricultural sector.
Specifically, income tends to be underreported, especially in societies with large agricultural or self-employed populations for
various reasons, including people forgetting items sold, reluctance to disclose the full extent of income, or reluctance to report
income earned illegally. In addition, income measures do not capture how household smooth consumption when facing a
negative or positive economic shock. Finally, income does not capture the advantage of having free or subsidized access to
services, such as housing, health care, education or child care.

     STYLIZED FACT 9: SOCIAL PROTECTION, PARTICULARLY PENSIONS,
       CONTRIBUTED TO MITIGATING THE LABOR MARKET SHOCK;
                      REMITTANCES FLOWS SHRANK

Pension income increased significantly in Albania over the period. The pension system deficit as a
share of GDP, including subsidies for rural pensions, increased from 2.7 percent in 2005 to 3.6 percent in
2012. This is partly linked to large increases in average pensions: administrative data shows that average
urban pensions rose by 18.9 percent and average rural pensions by 61.4 percent during 2007 –2012. In line
with administrative data, pension income increased significantly for households in rural areas (around 19
percent between 2008 and 2012) accounting for the majority of total income increases in those locations.
Overall, pensions accounted for a higher share of total household income in 2012 compared to 2008 (Tables
A9, A10 and A11).

Largely pensions, and to a lesser extent social assistance, contributed to mitigating the poverty
effect of the loss of jobs. Income from pensions and social assistance increased for all quintiles (Figure 21)
– particularly for the poorest - and both played an important role in mitigating poverty impacts from a labor
market shock (Figures 20). In relative terms, by 2012, households – poor and non-poor - relied much more
on pensions and private transfers as income sources than in 2008 (Table A9 through A10)

Remittances declined as the crisis hit the Eurozone, hitting some groups of the population in
Albania. Remittances fell from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.8 percent in 2013, largely due to the close
links to poorly-performing Greek and Italian economies where a large share of migrants reside. The stock of
Albanian emigrants stands at 40 percent: in 2013 – very high compared to neighbouring countries. Almost
1.3 million Albanians were living outside the country, most of them in Greece (46 percent) and Italy (36
percent).13

The decline in remittances affected relatively less the poorest – hence the lower role in increasing poverty –
but more so the income of the better-off. Those in the fourth quintile, who benefited significantly from
remittances between 2005 and 2008, suffered the largest contraction in this source of income during the
crisis period. While remittances represented around 8 percent of income for the non-poor in 2008, the share
of income from remittances was around 3 percent for the poor. This share declined dramatically by 2012
(Table A10 and A11), in line with the declining trends in aggregate remittances previously mentioned. For
the better-off in rural areas, remittances played a larger role both pre-crisis (increasing their income) and post
crisis (reducing their income) (Figure A5 through A8).

CONCLUSION

The stylized facts in this short note aimed at updating poverty trends for Albania using the 2012 LSMS and
exploring initial hypothesis on trends and drivers of poverty. Since poverty numbers and analysis were not
available since the 2008 LSMS round, this analysis can be useful in presenting issues and areas for further
research.

Findings show that poverty reduction halted in Albania in the recent period (2008-2012). Net trends were
driven by a combination of lower economic growth and particularly weakened labor markets, as well as
increases in social protection benefits particularly pensions. Poverty results are consistent with the story on
shared prosperity for Albania: the country performed well before the global economic crisis in terms of the
shared prosperity indicator (consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the distribution grew by 2.64%), but
this trend did not continue during the most recent period. In fact, from 2008 to 2012, mean consumption
declined by around 1.31% and 1.22% for the bottom 40 percent. Beyond the period analysed in this note,
prospects for poverty reduction in the coming years are positive in Albania but risks are on the downside.
Economic developments in Greece and the Eurozone could negatively impact economic growth, labor
markets, and remittances inflows, adversely affecting households.

Labor markets in Albania have been a key mechanism, as in most countries, driving poverty changes and
overall improvements or declines in welfare. The drop in employment and increase in both inactivity and
unemployment documented in this note, and their close association with poverty status, point to a critical
agenda in terms of job creation. Worryingly, labor markets further deteriorated beyond 2012, and Albania
faces multiple structural labor market challenges, with the low quality of jobs being a particularly salient
issue.14 However, knowledge gaps remain in terms of understanding the constraints to more and better jobs
in Albania.

In addition, the role of social protection is critical – as previously discussed - and improvements need to be
made there as well, as pointed in the recent Albania Systematic Country Diagnostic (World Bank, 2105).
Encouragingly, efforts are ongoing to better target the main social safety net program and make it more
compatible with work. However, other instruments that can respond to times of crisis should be re-visited
to ensure they are flexible enough to do so. Given that remittances are a source of income for many
households in Albania, and that remittances flows are highly vulnerable given economic struggles of sending
countries, counting on tools to protect the poor and vulnerable, alongside efforts to increase their market
income-generating capacity, is critical.

A poverty measurement agenda also emerges. Specifically, the main constraint for monitoring poverty and
overall welfare in Albania lies in the frequency of the surveys (thus far surveys have been carried out every 3
to 4 years) and availability of donor funding (used thus far to finance the household surveys). Tools for a
more frequent and sustained welfare monitoring are needed.
