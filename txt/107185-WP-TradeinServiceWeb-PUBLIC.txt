      This book is the result of an extensive agenda of analytical work on trade in services in Africa involving
      staff from various units of the World Bank and external contributors. The contributions to this volume
      seek to shed some light on uncharted opportunities for services trade in Africa, and invigorate and
      deepen the discussion about the role of services in trade diversification and economic upgrading
      on the continent. The focus is on less explored areas such as informal trade in services or trade in
      more sophisticated but equally neglected sectors such as professional services, education and health
      services, and services related to mining that are rarely associated with services trade in Africa. The
      aim of this volume is to provide the key messages from this work to a wide audience—the private
      sector, civil society, key ministries, relevant agencies—that is necessary to provide the broad base
      for successful implementation of reforms.
          We are very grateful to the authors of the chapters in this volume for making their work available
      for a wider audience. We would also like to thank the following for providing peer review comments

Foreword



A burgeoning services sector is fueling economic expansion in many African nations. In these coun-
tries, services already contribute substantially to GDP, absorb a large proportion of youth employ-
ment and matter substantially for gender parity. While at this stage it remains difficult to determine
the exact contribution of services and services trade to Africa’s growth and development, recent
evidence points to the transformational nature of services trade in promoting economic growth
through enhanced productivity, larger employment opportunities, improved gender parity as well as
a reduced incidence and severity of poverty. There is also ample evidence to support the resilience
of services trade during the recent financial crisis. For some African countries, a range of modern
services exports grew even faster than trade in goods.
    Services not only offer promising opportunities for export diversification, but are also key inputs
in the production of most exportable goods and services. Importing services can enhance the
accessibility and the quality of certain inputs and improve the overall productivity of firms. For many
decades, services have been playing a critical role in a traditional as well as a modern set-up, yet
their importance is downplayed in growth and development narratives. As oil and commodity prices
tumble globally, diversification into services exports will be critical for maintaining future growth in
Africa. In fact, trade in both formal and informal services would create an opportunity for growth
and poverty reduction in Africa. In this context, this book is extremely pertinent and timely in raising
the profile of services in the Africa region.
    Very little is known about trade in services in Africa and its prospective impact. The continent’s
potential to engage in trade in services, especially in dynamic knowledge-intensive activities remains
neglected. Africa’s export potential in traditional services, such as tourism, is clearly recognized,
but the incipient dynamism in exports of nontraditional services, such as business services is often
overlooked. This book broadens our understanding of services trade for Africa by opening up some
unexplored opportunities to invigorate and deepen the discussion on the role of traditional and
modern services in economic transformation, trade diversification and upgrading. The book provides
estimates on the magnitude of such flows and discusses the regulatory hurdles that prevent the
emergence of a services-led transformation as observed in some other regions of the world.
    An important challenge to exploring Africa’s potential in trade in services is the paucity of data.
Poor availability of data and huge discrepancies between official statistics and firm-level data make
analyses of services trade misleading. Informal trade in services flourishes across the continent, yet
data on such flows remain totally absent. Comprehensive comparisons across sectors and regions
are ambiguous or not possible. Furthermore, despite growing opportunities for African services
firms to export to neighboring countries, limited data on trade in services by partner country and
sparse information on regulatory policies and their application hamper the monitoring of progress
in services liberalization and regional integration. To draw attention to the available assessment tools
and policy instruments for possible refinement and broader application across sectors, this book
proposes novel data collection methods, such as crowdsourcing and mystery shopping, pioneering
knowledge transfer practices, and experiences with innovative policy reforms.

                         To realize the potential from services trade-led growth, trade in services, both formal and infor-
                     mal, needs to be high on the African policy agenda, with efforts to facilitate such trade flows by
                     eliminating harassment of services traders at the border or in the country of destination, simplifying
                     visa requirements, easing and clarifying residency requirements, and improving the work permit
                     application process. Further, greater support on coordinated trade and regulatory reforms, that
                     puts special emphasis on reform of immigration rules and regulatory cooperation at the regional
                     level, is much needed.
                         We hope that this book will generate a frank debate about the policies and actions needed to
                     strengthen Africa’s services sector and increase the continent’s participation in services trade. Mak-
                     ing more information available to traders, ensuring greater transparency of rules and regulations,
                     and pursuing regional regulatory cooperation would go a long way in integrating the fragmented
                     services markets in Africa.
