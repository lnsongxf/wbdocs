Energy prices, as measured by the World Bank energy
index, dropped 23 percent in 2014Q4, the largest
quarterly drop since 2008Q4, at the start of the global
recession. The current drop was driven by the plunge in
crude oil prices (down 26 percent for the quarter) while
coal and natural gas prices followed with smaller declines
of 7 and 1 percent respectively.

Recent developments

The oil market is at a historic turning point. After
fluctuating within a tight band around $105/bbl between
2011 and 2013 (figure 3), one of the least volatile three-

year periods in recent history, prices began to dive in
2014H2. OPEC’s decision to abandon targeting of prices
led to a further sharp correction. Crude oil price averaged
$74.6/bbl in 2014Q4, down from $100.4/bbl in the                   FIGURE 4           U.S. crude oil supply growth and

2015, averaging less than $50/bbl.

For the last three-and-a-half years, rapid expansion of
unconventional oil production in North America was
offset by supply disruptions in the Middle East almost
barrel for barrel (figure 4). These developments kept the
global oil market broadly in balance and prices in the
$100-110/bbl range. However, at the start of 2014H2,
some of the oil that off the market began returning, while
the United States continued its steady production growth
of 1 mb/d per year. Saudi Arabia—the balancing
producer with the largest spare capacity—would
normally lead OPEC in production cuts to stabilize the
prices. However, at its November 27, 2014 meeting,
OPEC decided to maintain its current quota and, in                 Source: : World Bank, International Energy Agency.

effect, ceased to manage the global supply in favor of
protecting its market share. The policy decision led to the
largest supply-driven correction in prices since 1986.             FIGURE 5           Brent/WTI price differential

As oil price plunged, the price differential between West
Texas Intermediate (WTI, the U.S. mid-continent price)
and Brent (the international marker) has been nearly
eliminated, from 30 percent in late 2011 to 5 percent in
December 2014 (figure 5). The large gap between the
two benchmark prices in 2011 and 2012 emerged as WTI
production soared and pipelines were built to transport
the crude to the refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, while
the decline in spread observed recently follows oil futures
going into contango (upward sloping curve),
incentivizing storage.

Outlook and risks

Nominal oil prices are expected to average $53/bbl in
2015, 45 percent lower than 2014 (table 1). This forecast
is significantly lower than the October 2014 edition of
the Commodity Outlook and reflects the shift in OPEC’s
policy, easing of geopolitical tensions, ample supplies,
and moderating demand. The large production capacity
currently in place points to a continuation of low prices
for some time, with prices expected to recover only
modestly, by $4/bbl, in 2016.

The weakness in crude oil prices will extend to other             Source: International Energy Agency.
energy markets as well, especially natural gas in Europe
and Asia. The European natural gas and the Japanese
liquefied natural gas (LNG) price benchmarks are
projected to decline 15 and 30 percent, respectively, in          FIGURE 10          Energy prices
2015. Moderate price declines are expected for coal and
U.S. natural gas as well.

There are two main risks to the energy price forecasts:

    Further demand and supply pressures: On the
     supply side, despite the fact that the costs of
     extracting unconventional oil may be above current
     oil prices, because most of these costs are sunk, it
     will take at least a year before supply moderates and
     is likely to occur through cancelation of new
     projects. Furthermore, most energy companies have
     engaged in cost reduction measures, enabling them
     to sustain most projects. On the demand side, the
     IEA expects further weakening, with oil                      Source: World Bank.

    OPEC’s policies: A significant part of the decline in
     oil prices has been driven by the cartel’s November
     27 decision to let markets determine the price rather
     than engaging in supply management. Prior to the
     November decision, Saudi Arabia—OPEC’s largest
     and most influential member—engaged in a series of
     price discounts to various Asian oil importers, thus
     signalling its intention to abandon price targeting.
     OPEC officials have repeatedly stated that the cartel
     will not act even if prices decline to $20/bbl.

Agricultural prices are expected to experience a 4.8
percent decline in 2015, on top of the 3.4 percent decline
in 2014. Food commodity prices are expected to decline
4.2 percent. Edible oils and meals are expected to decline
the most (7.1 percent down), followed by grains (-3.7
percent), and other food items (-1 percent). Among
grains, the largest decline will be in maize (7 percent
down in 2015) followed by wheat and rice (each 2
percent down in 2015). Among edible oils, palm and
soybean oil will decline 15 and 10 percent, respectively,
while soybeans will drop 8 percent. Raw material prices
