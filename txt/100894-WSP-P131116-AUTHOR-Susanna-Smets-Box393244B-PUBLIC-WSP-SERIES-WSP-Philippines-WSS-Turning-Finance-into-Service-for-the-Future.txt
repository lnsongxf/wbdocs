Turning Finance into
Services for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, non-
government organizations and private sector. The core team of the National Economic Development Agency (NEDA) has
been a key partner with the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank in facilitating the Service Delivery Assessment.
The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions of all other agencies that participated, specifically the Department
of Budget and Management, Department of Health, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Public
Works and Highways, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of
the Philippines, Local Water Utilities Administration, Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, the National Water
Resources Board as well as other government agencies, development partners and international and local NGOs active in
the sector.

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The
following World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process
and report: Rosario Aurora L. Villaluna and U-Primo E. Rodriguez, Edkarl Galing, Aileen Castro, and Almud Weitz. Thanks go
to World Bank staff Sudipto Sarkar, Sector Leader, and Ousmane Dione, Practice Manager, who peer reviewed the report.

The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bank’s Wa­    ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This

regional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct­
in more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to as­        sess the
adequacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de­    livery pathways.
SDA’s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for
                                                                                                nance is effectively turned into

     Sector-Wide: Institutions, Financing and Monitoring
     •	 Implement new institutional arrangements including an expanded role for the National Water Resources Board as
        the sector regulator and its transition to a National Water Resources Management Office, and the establishment of
        a dedicated Water and Sanitation Unit as a lead sector agency (hosting department/agency to be identified through
        institutional review).
     •	 Improve coordination mechanisms between actors at provincial and municipal levels
     •	 Establish a national capacity building program, especially to address rural subsectors, by consolidating various
        initiatives already in place including the regional capacity building hubs established under DILG
     •	 Harmonise data collection systems, standardise the definition of terms and develop a coherent sector monitoring
        framework
     •	 Establish a collective platform for a multi-stakeholder review process to monitor subsector performance (for
        example Joint Annual Sector Reviews)
     •	 Increase sector investment, particularly in rural areas where large disparities exist between rich and poor, as well
        as funding for “software”, specifically for rural sanitation programs
     •	 Align budgeting to support the implementation of long-term strategies and investment plans by public service
        providers, and translate these into annual work plans and budget
     •	 Introduce key results areas for local water supply and sanitation services to increase local accountability for service
        improvements and incentivize LGUs to access additional funding sources including matching grants from national
        government and private sector sources
     •	 Create a national account for water and sanitation, disaggregated between urban and rural to enable monitoring of
        financial flows towards the subsectors



     Priority Actions for Rural Water Supply
     •	 Enable economies of scale and financial viability in service provision by encouraging the consolidation of small
        service providers
     •	 Formalize the management of small piped schemes and introduce light-handed regulation including the use of
        performance contracts to drive service quality and reliability and incentivize service provision to the poor
     •	 Expand the provision of technical support to small providers, combined with business planning services to facilitate
        access to finance for system expansion
     •	 Operationalise policies for full cost recovery for rural scheme operation to reduce the investment gap and improve
        sustainability of services
     •	 Enhance rural water supply improvements (piped schemes) via other poverty alleviation programs such as the
        Bottom-Up Budgeting Process and the National Community Development Driven program
     •	 Develop systems for management support to schemes operated by community-based organizations, through
        partnerships with private sector and water districts

   Priority Actions for Urban Water Supply
   •	 Establish a comprehensive regulatory framework covering all types of service providers, including local government-
      run schemes, water districts plus private and independent operators, both large and small, and consolidate these
      roles gradually within a national regulator
   •	 Develop a financing policy and strategy, linked with a graduation policy for utilities based on creditworthiness, in
      order to attract commercial finance, and accelerate access to concessional finance to support the expansion of
      services
   •	 Strengthen the capacity of local government to contract, manage and oversee private sector participation
      modalities, in order to leverage private sector investment, use professional capabilities of the private sector and
      encourage the consolidation of small-scale service providers
   •	 Introduce multi-stakeholder, performance-based planning and monitoring including a system of annual subsector
      reviews
   •	 Build capacity and increase the accountability of LGUs for improving the quality and sustainability of service
      provision, using performance benchmarks and an incentive and/or penalty system



   Priority Actions for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene
   •	 Operationalize the Zero Open Defecation program, within the framework of an equitable rural sanitation and hygiene
      promotion policy, a capacity building plan, an implementation plan and a monitoring system
   •	 Develop a financing strategy for the program that includes public investments to generate household demand for
      sanitation, output-based subsidies to the very poor and collective incentives for barangays and LGUs in achieving
      Zero Open Defecation
   •	 Strengthen rural sanitation promotion via other poverty alleviation programmes, such as the Bottom-Up Budgeting
      Process, the National Community Development Driven programme and target poor households through the
      National Cash Transfer Program (4Ps)




   Priority Actions for Urban Sanitation and Hygiene
   •	 Establish institutional arrangements to facilitate implementation of the National Sewerage and Septage Management
      Program (NSSMP) and increase Local Government and Water District accountability for the coverage and quality of
      urban sanitation services
   •	 Develop a sanitation investment framework and mandate local governments to adopt City Sanitation Plans
      incorporating measures to improve cost recovery and extend affordable services to the poor
   •	 Adopt a cost-effective approach to investment whereby the gradual expansion of sewerage is complemented by
      measures to maximize connections and to improve fecal sludge management, since most households will continue
      using septic tanks for the foreseeable future
   •	 Build local capacity to enable successful planning and implementation of the NSSMP

be supported by an estimated US$342 million/year in
operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures (Table 2.2).
A large proportion (62%) of this amount is for water supply.
The critical issue here is whether tariffs of the utilities are
sufficiently high to cover operation and maintenance
requirements to support the water supply and sanitation
facilities they need to maintain (and on top of that allow for
depreciation to replace investments and support expansion).
For facilities that are maintained by households, e.g. toilets
and hand pumps, the issue is whether such O&M services
are readily available and affordable for rural households, to
avoid breakdown and collapse.

     Priorty actions for the institutional framework
     •	 Implement new institutional arrangements including an expanded role for the National Water Resources Board as
        the sector regulator and its transition to a National Water Resources Management Office, and the establishment of
        a dedicated Water and Sanitation Unit as a lead sector agency (hosting department/agency to be identified through
        institutional review)
     •	 Improve coordination mechanisms between actors at provincial and municipal levels
     •	 Establish a national capacity building program to address rural subsectors by consolidating various initiatives
        already in place including the regional capacity building hubs established under the DILG



The Philippine water and sanitation sector has for years                          small private service providers, while LWUA regulates

impedes progress in service delivery and the protection                           a financial interest. There is no agency regulating service
of water resources. Until recently there has been no single                       provision by LGUs. The lack of a strong, independent
agency to oversee the sector, but significant efforts are now                     regulator has impeded the achievement of universal access
underway to address this as outlined in Section 2.                                to adequate, reliable services and in some cases allowed
                                                                                  poor performance to continue unchecked.
Table 4.1 illustrates the complexity of current institutional
arrangements. Urban water supply services are provided                            While there is no formal clear-cut distinction between
by a host of agencies including the Metropolitan Water and                        the rural and urban subsectors, most rural piped water

   Water Districts are quasi private water service providers, officially categorized as Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCC). Under Philippine
Laws, waterless municipalities are those where less than 50% of their population have access to potable water. GOCCs are stock or non-stock corporations
established by a special charter or law for the interest of everyone and subject to the test of economic viability. It is owned or controlled by the government
directly, or indirectly through a parent corporation or a subsidiary corporation.
19
   This means that the contractual agreements of the private provider and government agency provide for a regulator specific for their area of operation. Such
regulation by contract exists in Metro Manila, Subic, and other LGU-based service contracts.

      Priority actions for financing
      •	 Create a national account for water and sanitation, disaggregated between urban and rural to enable monitoring of
         investments towards the subsectors
      •	 Increase investments towards water supply and sanitation, particularly in rural areas where large disparities exist
         between the rich and the poor
      •	 Align budgeting processes to support the implementation of long-term strategies and investment plans by public
         service providers and translate these into annual work plans
      •	 Improve local capacity in procurement and other financial management processes to facilitate budget releases.
      •	 Introduce key result areas for local water supply and sanitation services to increase local accountability for
         service improvements and incentivise LGUs to access additional funding sources including matching grants from
         government

    For 2012, the Salintubig Program was given a budget of PhP 800 million through the DILG and PhP 700 Million through LWUA. An additional PhP 500 million
 was also received by the DILG in 2012 to finance a number of water projects under the Transition Investment Support Plan (TISP) for ARMM. For 2013, a total
 of PhP 1.5 billion Salintubig Fund was allocated through the DILG. These budgets are mostly for water infrastructure with DILG allocating 4-5% of project costs
 for capacity development.

   Executive Order 279 of 2004 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations provided for reforms in the financing policies for the water supply and sewerage
sector and water service providers and for the rationalization of LWUA’s organizational structure and operations. LWUA Employee’s Union filed a case in court
where they were granted a Temporary Restraining Order that prevented the implementation of this policy.

   LWUA provided soft loans to the water districts operating in waterless municipalities.

   The PWRF was set up by the Philippine government, American aid agency USAID and JICA to leverage concessional financing for water projects by bringing
in private financial institutions. USAID supported the capacity-building program, while JICA provided a 40-year soft loan to be lent on to individual projects. The
fund is administered by the Development Bank of the Philippines.

   In 2009, Manila Water managed to get Presidential Approval for contract extension until 2037. Maynilad Water’s contract extension was approved in 2010. The
longer concession period will allow the concessionaires to implement a higher investment plan while at the same time lowering the scheduled tariff adjustments
to ensure customer affordability.

    Compared to the JMP list, no distinction is made in the NSO’s census on whether dug wells or springs are protected or not making them fall in the list of
 unimproved sources of water. Rain collection is also not in the NSO list. For sanitation, ventilated improved pit latrine and composting toilets are not in the NSO
 list considering that these types of toilets are not common in the Philippines. Water-sealed toilets with other depository in the NSO list would be similar to the
 flush or pour-flush to elsewhere category in the JMP list. However, the NDHS and APIS surveys also conducted by NSO use the JMP categories. The FHSIS
 reports do not have the different categories of sources of water and sanitary toilets in their reporting.

Much of the available data on urban water supply and
sanitation relate to Metro Manila where the private sector
concessionaires submit regular reports to MWSS. Outside
of Metro Manila, water districts generally report to LWUA,
while for non-water districts, regulated CPC holders of the
NWRB are only required to report every five years.

Responsibility for monitoring rural water supply and
sanitation coverage rests with provincial and municipal
LGUs. The DILG has started to collect this information,
but mostly for the waterless municipalities under their
SALINTUBIG Program.

A proposal to set up an inter-agency, multi-stakeholder
platform for sector monitoring was strongly supported in
the SDA stakeholder consultation workshops. The approval
of the proposed National Water Resources Management
Office provides for the creation of one national, and several
local level, multi-stakeholder platforms for monitoring
progress and for knowledge, information sharing and
collaboration.

       •	 Enable economies of scale and financial viability in service provision by consolidating small service providers and/
          or providing access to finance for system expansion
       •	 Formalize the management of small piped schemes and introduce light-handed regulation including the use
          performance contracts to drive service quality and reliability and incentivize service provision to the poor
       •	 Enhance rural water supply improvements (piped schemes) via other poverty alleviation programs such as the
          Bottom-Up Budgeting Process and the National Community Development Driven programme
       •	 Expand the provision of technical support to small providers, combined with business planning services to facilitate
          access to finance for system expansion
       •	 Develop systems for management support to schemes operated by community-based organisations, through
          partnerships with private sector and water districts

Strategies are needed to improve the quality and
sustainability of service delivery and facilitate greater access
to piped schemes by the poor. One element in achieving
this would be to encourage water service providers to
develop operations large enough to achieve economies of
scale, though the consolidation of small providers and/or by
enabling access to finance for system expansion via tariffs,
borrowing or public grants.

At national level, another important initiative would be to
formalize the management of smaller schemes such as
those under LGU control and bring them within the remit
of the sector regulator. It is encouraging that plans for
this are already underway, with regulatory requirements
differentiated according to the level of service offered.
Performance contracts could be a vehicle for regulation,
helping to drive service quality and reliability and
incentivising service provision to the poor.

          run schemes, water districts plus private and independent operators, both large and small, and consolidate these
          roles gradually within a national regulator
       •	 Develop a financing policy and strategy, linked with a graduation policy for utilities based on the creditworthiness,
          in order to attract commercial finance, and accelerate access to concessional finance to support the expansion of
          services
       •	 Develop capacity of local government to contract, manage and oversee private sector participation modalities, in
          order to leverage private sector investment, use professional capabilities of the private sector and encourage the
          consolidation of small-scale service providers
       •	 Introduce multi-stakeholder, performance-based planning and monitoring including a system of annual subsector
          reviews
       •	 Build capacity and increase the accountability of LGUs for improving the quality and sustainability of service
          provision, using performance benchmarks and an incentive and/or penalty system

   The NSSMP provides for the following six intervention areas: a) Septage management (collection, treatment and reuse of biosolids); b) Sewerage systems
(interceptors, piped sewerage and centralized treatment plants); c) Ecological sanitation (dry sanitation or urine diversion dry toilet [UDDT], arbor loo,
excreta reuse); d) Toilets (public toilets, programs to reduce open defecation); e) Systems for point sources (factories, markets, high rise buildings, schools,
slaughterhouses); and f) Systems for non-point sources (open bottom septic tanks, backyard hog farms).

   The Philippine Water Supply Roadmap (NEDA, 2010) provides definitions of Levels 1 to 3 water services that are based on NEDA Board Resoluiation No. 12.
 These are as follows. Level 1 (point sources) is ‘a protected well or a developed spring with an outlet but without a distribution system as it is generally adaptable
 for rural areas where the houses are thinly scattered serving average of 15 households with people having to fetch water from up to 250 meters distance.’ Level
 2 (communal water faucet system or stand post) is ‘a piped system with communal or public faucets usually serving 4-6 households within 25 meters distance.’
 Level 3 is ‘a fully reticulated system with individual house connections based on a daily water demand of more than 100 liters per person.’

 Annex 3:
 Comparative Explanation of
 SDA Costing
 This annex describes the key differences in the assumptions             for example, investment requirements reported for the SDA
 and estimates of the SDA costing tool used in the current               (US$ 838 million) were about four times higher than the
 analysis and the Study on Developing the Institutional                  estimates of the De Vera study. The divergence between
 Framework for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector and                the two sets of results can be explained by differences
 Identifying Investment Plans and Programs (De Vera et al.,              in assumptions. The most obvious difference lies in the

 in the current analysis are substantially higher than those             supply estimates, and (c) the inclusion of the toilets and on-
