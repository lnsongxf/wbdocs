THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      Companies have 2 options: either to resort to lawyer services to draft
      the company documents or to fill in the standards documents. If the
      company decides to use the standard statutes of Association from the
      Guichê Único da Empresa (2 pages), it takes 1 hour at most. The
      applicant just enters the information (ID info of associates, address,                      the fees are

      Obtain NIF at Guichê Único da Empresa

      Once documents are verified and completed, applicants must apply to
      the National Tax Office (Direcção National dos Impostos) to obtain the
      National Identification Number (NIF). This service is free of charge and
      does not take more than 15 minutes. However, the tax fee is Kz 25,595.                  tax fees included in

      registration fees at Guichê Único da Empresa

      The applicant submits the dossier to the Notary Public at the Guichê
      Único da Empresa. Once the Notary reviews and notarizes the dossier,
      he will have a reading with the applicant present or the accredited
      person to ensure that there are no mistakes. This service fee is included
      in the Guichê fees and takes a day depending on room availability and
      complexity of the company’s Articles of incorporation. After this lecture,                See procedure

      For Imprensa national, the receipt is sufficient to continue the process.
      Despite the fact that law says that documents should be published
      before getting the license to operate, the system at Imprensa National
      makes it unlikely for daily or weekly publication, therefore the Ministry
      of Commerce uses the receipt as proof.

      Each of the organizations sited above have a representative within
      Guichê Único da Empresa with authority to deliver the accreditation
      that the step has been accomplished. Obtaining the final document
      (except the publication in the Official Gazette) would take 4 days (on
      average). Fees are paid at the bank counter of banco BAI within the
      Guichê Único da Empresa to facilitate payment of the different fees.
      Each agency and fees goes to a specific account and payments can be
      made cash or by card.

      Obtain the Commercial Operations Permit from the Ministry of
      Commerce

      To carry out commercial activities in Angola, a company must obtain a
      commercial operations permit (Alvará) from the Ministry of Commerce.
      To apply for the issuance of the commercial operations permit, the
      following documents must be filed with the Municipal Delegation of the
      Ministry of Commerce: (a) company’s notary deed of incorporation; (b)
      copy of the tax identification card; (c) commercial registration
      certificate; (d) statistical registration certificate; (e) extracts from the
      criminal record of the founders; (f) opinion, by the relevant
      administrative authority, on the company’s geographical location and
      social and economic feasibility; and (g) a photocopy of ID or passport.
      For the issuance of the commercial operations permit, one requirement
6     is for the relevant administrative authorities to inspect the company’s        60 days      USD 1,000
      premises to confirm they are suitable for commercial activities.

      In order to obtain the license, some inspections to the facilities need to
      take place in some businesses.

      Since the Decree no. 40/12 came into effect, it is now possible to get a
      provisional license right away giving the firm a permit to operate for
      180 days while the definitive license is issued by the Ministry of
      Commerce.

        Obtain a Proof of Title of Property for the Land

        Before obtaining the Proof of Title, BuildCo must also obtain the
        Usufruct of the Land from the Instituto de Planeamento e Gestao
        Urbana de Luanda. This is often a time-consuming procedure taking up
        to one year or more. However, it is assumed in the case study that
        BuildCo already owns the land.

        BuildCo must obtain a Proof of Title of Property for the Land from the
        Real Estate Registry in Luanda. An updated certificate of the property
        ("certidão predial") is obtained from the relevant Real Estate Registry. It
        sets out a full description of the property, including information on its
        owner and any charges, liens or encumbrances pending on the
   1    property.                                                                      7 days         AOA 4,500

        The total fee for the "certidão predial" includes: stamp duty (calculated

        to the Law on Justice Fees); fees to justice officers (according to the set
        contributions for the Justice budget); notary fees and other fees. The
        total fee is also dependent on the current value of the fiscal unit (UCF),
        currently at AOA 88.00, according to Despacho no. 174/11 of March 11,

        Hire an electrical contractor to obtain permits with Department of
        Supervision and Licensing

        The client hires an electrical contractor that has to be licensed by the
        Ministry of Energy. This electrical contractor prepares the entire project
        and gets approvals for the customer. The electrical contractor provides
        technical terms of reference and sends them to the Department of
        Supervision and Licensing (Departamento de Licenciamento e
        Fiscalizacao) of the Ministry of Energy for approval and signature along
        with the following documents: Electrical plans, company license, tax
        number, ID of the person, and some general letters (application forms).
        The electrical contractor also has to obtain an electrical permit (license
        for electrical works) and a license for exploitation at the Department of
   1    Supervision and Licensing. The electricity distribution utility, EDEL (      14 calendar days        AOA 19,610
        Empresa de Electricidade de Luanda), is designing the external
        connection works, but the physical works are done by the electrical
        contractor. The meter gets installed before the physical external
        connection works start.

        Since September 2012, the client does not have to submit an application
        with ENE (Empresa Nacional de Electricidade). The authority of ENE
        regarding distribution has been transferred to EDEL. ENE focuses now on
        production and distribution.
