Start-up               A newly established business venture that is in its first stages of operation. This
                       report focuses on tech start-ups, which are start-ups that have a technological
                       component. These start-ups are typically designed to scale up quickly.

Start-up Ecosystem     The combination of people, start-ups at various stages and other stakeholders
                       and organizations supporting or connecting to these start-ups, interacting in
                       multiple dimensions to create and scale new start-up ventures.

Scale-up (Firm)        OECD defines a scale-up as a firm that has an average annualized return of at least
                       20 percent in the past three years with at least 10 employees at the beginning of
                       the period (OECD 2007).

Venture Capital (VC)   An institutional investor that provides financing to start-ups and small early stage
                       firms. Usually VCs look for high growth potential firms to exit the investment in
                       the short term.

Angel Investor         An investor who invest in ventures (primarily at an early stage) in their personal
                       capacity (that is, investing their personal money) and may or may not have an
                       active advisory or guidance role for the founders in the venture.

Mentor                 An experienced person who can provide advice, knowledge, or connections to
                       a start-up founder. Mentors usually have strong business acumen and practical
                       experience through former entrepreneurship experience or industry knowledge.

Business Acumen        Theoretical or practical knowledge of how to develop and manage a business,
                       including proclivity and speed in understanding and dealing with risks and
                       opportunities in the business environment.

Exit                   Refers to the point at which a founder or early stage investors sell their stakes
(start-up exit)        in the venture, generally either in a private acquisition or public offering. This
                       report refers more widely to “start-up exit” as the point at which a start-up is
                       sustainable or it has received sufficient funding to grow in the medium-term
                       (that is, over the next five years).

           Technology is one of the main drivers of               description and measurement of the city’s tech
           productivity and economic growth (Isaksson,            start-up ecosystem; and (ii) a comparison and gap

 The tech start-up ecosystem in Beirut is an early to middle                   but incorporation, renting an office, hiring qualified personnel,
 stage ecosystem, that has passed its nascent growth phase                     and obtaining a credit line from a bank typically takes about
 but is still far from maturity. On average, each year, 12 more                a month. Obtaining funding is a much lengthier process
 start-ups are created than in the previous year, resulting in a 24            taking about four months to close (for example, individual or

 Start-ups in Beirut face some bureaucratic hurdles in their life              particularly striking: in Beirut, it takes twice as long for a start-up
 cycle (see Figure 2.2). Ventures can rapidly open a bank account              to obtain credit and almost four times as long to receive funding.11

     Limitations
                                                                         2016                         22
     It is difficult to determine whether the sample is
     representative. The collection of the data was heavily
     dependent upon the participation of individuals in existing
                                                                         2015                         25
     networks, and as such the networks of the study’s partners
     are likely to be overrepresented. There is also a possibility
     that sub-segments of the of the ecosystem have been
     dropped or were never part of the outreach networks, and            2014                         8
     as such they would not end up in the resulting data sample.
     To a certain extent, this bias is not problematic, as it means
     that the data and analysis document those individuals and
                                                                         2013                         14
     nodes that are actively and currently engaged in developing
     the ecosystem. This suggests that they are also more likely
     to participate in and respond to policies designed to
     develop the ecosystem. However, since there are few other           2012                         20
     databases with which to compare the data, it is difficult to
     assess exactly whether the sample is truly representative.
                                                                         2011                         13
     The sample is small and influenced by outliers. To address
     this, where possible medians rather than means were used
     as descriptive statistics. Some of the analysis (for example,
     that of “successful” start-ups) relies on very small portions       2010                         9
     of the dataset, and thus give relatively weak information on
     unobserved, population-level characteristics.
                                                                         2009                         8
     Data cleanliness is difficult to evaluate. Missing data
     could represent a true lack of connection in the ecosystem,
     or potentially could be the result of respondents dropping
     off the survey due to technical issues or a lack of interest to     < 2009                       23

primary interest was in mapping the social dimensions
of the start-up network, not creating a year-by-year

     BOX A.1 WHAT IS CENTRALITY?


                                                                                                                              Degree centrality
             By calculating centrality measures of stakeholders in the dataset, key players
             in the community can be identified quantitatively.

             The diagrams below, while not specific to our dataset, help illustrate the
             definition and interpretation of each type of centrality. Red indicates higher
             centrality values. Blue indicates lower centrality values.

             Degree centrality measures the number of other nodes within the                                                 Closeness centrality
             ecosystem each node is directly connected to. It does not take into account
             any second-order connections.


             Closeness centrality measures a node’s social distance to other nodes. It is
             expressed as the inverse of the average distance from each node to every
             other node in the network. A low closeness centrality indicates that the firm
             is on the edge of the network.                                                                                Eigenvector centrality



             Eigenvector centrality augments degree centrality by taking into account
             the connectivity of the nodes a node is connected to. Highly connected nodes
             within highly interconnected clusters have high eigenvector centrality.


             Betweenness centrality measures how many times a node acts as a gateway                                       Betweenness centrality
             in the network. The higher the betweenness centrality of a firm, the more
             paths run through that firm to connect two other firms. High betweenness
             centrality means that a node is a key bridge or facilitator between different
             clusters.
