﻿WORLD BANK'S INDIA DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
Given its vast geographic and climatic diversity,
India is prone to all major natural hazards
and has experienced the highest number of
disasters in South Asia, with an increasing
trend in events and causalities over the past 40
years. It is particularly exposed to earthquakes
(tsunamis), floods, droughts, cyclones and
landslides. About 60 percent of the landmass
is prone to earthquakes of varying intensities;
over 8 percent is prone to floods; almost 5,700
kilometers of the 7,500 kilometer coastline is
prone to cyclones and 68 percent of the area is
susceptible to drought.

In August 2008, Bihar was devastated by floods
when a section of the embankment on the river
Kosi breached resulting in massive inundation
in the districts of Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa,
Purnia and Araria. The World Bank supported
long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts
through the Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery project.
This was followed up by a second project
that focuses on building resilience to floods
and supporting the overall development of
communities in the Kosi Basin.
