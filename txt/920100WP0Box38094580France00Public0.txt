THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

       Although it is not legally mandatory to check the proposed company
       name for uniqueness before registering a company, this procedure is
       included because legal consequences may follow if this step is omitted.

      File a request for a company’s registration with the Centre de
      Formalités des Entreprises (CFE)



      "The Centre de Formalités des Entreprises (CFE) handles all formalities
      related to the trade register in the court (RCS, Tribunal de Commerce),
      statistics (INSEE), tax authorities (Centre des Impôts), social security
      (URSSAF), labor (Direction Departemental du Travail et de L’emploi),
      health insurance (Caisse regionale D’assurance Maladie),
      unemployment insurance, pension, Employment Pole (Pole Emploi),
      and similar bodies. This includes the registration of the company bylaws
      with the tax administration. Company articles of association and bylaws,
      lease, attestation of receipt of funds, documents concerning the
      manager, ad hoc forms, evidence of publication, and so forth, must be
      filed in a single file. After receiving the request, the CFE must process
      the documents and transfer them to the respective offices and                               EUR 84.24 paid to
      authorities. If the request is incomplete, the CFE has 15 days to return                   the trade register in
      the documents for completion. The CFE automatically enters the            1 day on average   the Commercial

      Etablissements), and NAF number (Nomenclature des Activitees
      Francaises). The SIRET is used, among other things, by the tax
      authorities.

      Since the Dutreil Law, the CFE or the Commercial Registry can deliver a
      receipt for company creation (récepissé de creation d’entreprise) as
      soon as they have received the documents, so that the company can
      start operations without having to wait for its RCS number.

      The principle of electronic company registration was enacted by Law
      2003-721 (August 1, 2003) and implemented under Decree No. 2005-77
      (February 1, 2005). However, a hard copy file is still required. As of
      Decree No. 2006-679 of June 9, 2006, the founder has the option to file
      either with the CFE or directly with the Companies Registry (greffe),

        which subsequently files the documents with the CFE on the company's
        behalf. This option is slightly less costly because the CFE service fees are
        excluded. However, the founder must register the company's bylaws
        with the tax administration in person. "

        * Buy company books (minute books, inventory books, ledgers).

        Special accounting company books must be bought from the court or
        specialized stores. The books have numbered pages or numbered

        company to acquire the book later, after it starts operation.

      Housing Ministry (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports et du
      Logement) (www.equipement.gouv.fr/). Four copies of the application
      are filed at City Hall and a receipt is given in person or it may be sent
      by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt. If one document is
      missing, claims must be made within 14 days after registration. Where
      the application is accompanied by all the required documents, the
      contractor will receive acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the date
      and registration number and the time needed for title investigation.

      The building permit will be issued within 3 months after registration of
      the application (except where the plot is a classified site). The
      contractor shall deem the permit tacitly granted if no reply is received
      within the 3 month period. The building permit is valid for 2 years. The
      contractor must begin work (or apply for an extension) within that time;
      otherwise, the permit expires. Moreover, if the contractor halts work for
      over a year, the validity of the permit expires, even if the 2-year
      statutory period has not yet elapsed. The permit must be displayed at
      the construction site and must include all the requisite information:
      mandatory dimensions, building permit number and date of issue,
      name of permit holder, nature of the work, and the address of City Hall
      where construction documents are open to public scrutiny.

      A copy of the building permit must be available in City Hall for 2
      months to enable any aggrieved third parties (i.e., adjacent property
      owners) to challenge it.

      France (ERDF)

      For the works to start, the client needs to pay at least 50% of the
      estimate of fees.
      Electricité Réseau Distribution France then generates an identification
      number that will be used in all its future communications with the client,
      and especially when the client will request final connection (energization)
      from their electricity supplier.
      Electricité Réseau Distribution France will also indicate an expected for
      the end of the external works, a date after which the service can be
      energized.

      As soon as the client has received this information, they can contact their
      electricity supplier to prepare the supply contract required for final
      connection.

      The connection process might also require works in public or private
      domain. In this case Electricité Réseau Distribution France takes care of
      any necessary administrative permits.
      These procedures might cause additional delays in the process, but are

      along with the connection requirements.
      Upon receiving the client’s confirmation and payment, Electricité Réseau
      Distribution France sends the client a mail confirming the date of
      completion of external works.
      Once the works are completed, the client’s private electrical installation
      or site is connected to the public distribution network. The client should
      not wait for the external works to end in order to undertake the
      necessary procedures needed to obtain a conformity certificate (of
      internal installation) or a supply contract.

      In the case where the requested capacity is more than 120 kVA
      connection consists of a direct connection from a MV/LV substation.
      Therefore, an extension is carried out until the Main Individual Circuit
      Breaker. Moreover, aero-underground connections are possible only for
      capacities below 120 kVA.
      Beyond 250 kVA a unit substation is necessary.

      The notary writes to the city mayor to obtain the waiver of the city’s
      preemption rights on the property. The notary informs about the
      transaction and the conditions agreed among the parties. It is common
      that many properties are subject to these requirements, since the
      Municipality may have the right to buy the property at the same price
      that it was agreed on the sale agreement. If the city does not answer in            20 days
      2 months, then the preemption rights have been waived. It may be the            (simultaneous
      case that the city informs the notary before the 2 months. There are          with Procedures         no cost

      co-ownership rules have been published at the land registry more than
      10 years ago. Properties when the whole lot and building are sold will
      need the waiver for preemption rights. In practice it takes around 3
      weeks on average to obtain this waiver.

      Notaries prepare the draft of the deed of sale

      By law, notaries are charged with administering nearly all aspects of the
      transaction: preparation, signing and execution of the final deed.
      The purchaser’s notary with the assistance of the vendor’s notary
      prepares the draft of the deed of sale. The deed of sale contains two
      parts:
      The first part is a standardized one and is the one sent to the Land
      Registry. It contains all relevant information for registration purposes.
      The manner in which this part is drafted is compulsory, failing which the
      Land Registry refuses registration of the deed of sale.
      The first part of the deed of sale contains the following information:
      • Details (full name, address, extrait CABIS) of the vendor and of the
      purchaser
      • Description of the property which must refer to the cadastral reference
      • Origin of title (provided by the seller)
      • Sale price                                                                                Fees are due at the

      planning, existing contracts relating to the property, environmental
      aspects of the property;
      • Conditions of the sale;
      • Information on the title to the property, i.e. a description of the transfer
      of title over the 30-year period;
      • Information on easements.
      Although some of the information described in the 2nd part of the
      transfer deed is not compulsory for the Real Estate Registry it is
      compulsory under other legislation failing which the purchaser could
      seek termination of the sale after it has been completed, for
      misinformation.
      The notary of the vendor collects and provides the notary of the
      purchaser with the following documents:

      The deed of sale is executed by a notary

      Once the notary has completed the necessary searches and inspections,
      acquired the necessary information from the local authorities and the
      bank (if there's to be a mortgage), and prepares the final deed of sale,
      the parties meet once again with him for the execution of the deed of
      sale.
      The deed of sale must be executed before a notary, failing which it
      cannot be registered at the relevant Land Registry. The notary is
      required to read the deed through completely, aloud, to both the seller
      and buyer and make any relevant amendments, and assure that they
      both understand the terms. Registration fees and notaries’ fees are
      payable up-front.
      The buyer has full ownership of the property immediately after the deed                        0.825% of
      of sale has been signed before the notary. He can dispose of the                             purchase price

      According to law no. 2011-1117 du 19 septembre 2011, art. 1er (V), the
      notary must apply for registration of the deed of sale at the relevant
      Land Registry within 1 month of the date of execution of the deed of
      sale. In practice, in 2012, the median time for submission between the
      moment the deed is signed and the moment it is submitted to the land
      registry is 21 days, as shown by the statistics for the 12 land registries in
      Paris (Services de Publicite Fonciere) (source, ‘Direction générale des

        (the value added tax is paid by the company directly). The original deed
        of sale (called the “minutes”) remains with the notary for 75 years.
        The Land Registry will verify the transaction (name and date of birth of
        person should coincide with the Conservation’s records; parcel & section
        catastrale). The transfer of property is opposable to third parties after
        publication of the deed by the land registry office.
        On completion the vendor’s creditors if any, must execute a deed of
        discharge or release of the existing mortgages benefiting to them.

        In June 2009, 28% of all transfer publication requests in France are made
        electronically (for publication of the "acte authetique de vente" in order
        to make it opposable to third parties) . This rate has been increasing
        consistently during 2009. This makes the system faster and reduces the
        chances for errors, because the Conservation employees do not have to
        input information manually into the system. Data is inserted
        electronically into the Fiji system automatically from Teleactes. Land
        registries are proactively inviting notaries to participate in the electronic
        system, with a positive response from notaries.
        At this point, First the notary prepares the acte de vente with its own
        software, prints and has it signed by the parties. Then he inputs the
        information again in a separate screen of Teleactes to submit it to the
        Service de Publicite Fonciere for publication.
