[   Successfully promoting pro-competition
     market reforms, opening of markets,
    and infusion of competition principles in
            other sectoral policies.

In many markets in developing economies, competition is hampered
                                                                [
by laws and regulations that limit entry or affect firms’ capacities
to compete. Bans to private investment or legal monopolies close
markets to potential new investors; controls on prices and other
variables increase business risk and reduce firms’ efforts to improve
products or services and lower prices; and lack of pro-competitive
rules in network sectors limit the ability of equally or more
efficient players to compete with incumbents. To ensure effective
competition in markets, it is essential for competition authorities to
study legal and regulatory barriers to competition and implement
advocacy strategies to remove or modify dispositions that are
blocking development of healthy competition.

After extensive research, Colombia’s
competition authority successfully
engaged with other government
agencies in the allocation of fourth-
generation long-term evolution (4G
LTE) spectrum for mobile Internet and
voice service to ensure competition
in an expanding market. As a
result, additional firms were able to
compete with incumbents in the
market, promoting innovation, price
competition, and consumer choice.

in the government understood that open and

produce a more competitive market, and all its

Results: MinTIC and CRC designed different
scenarios to advance the bidding process, weighing
the pros and cons of reserving spectrum for entrants
(and excluding the dominant operator). The auction
process was adapted to specify which operators
could bid on available blocks of spectrum, and two
blocks were held for bids from entrants and smaller
operators. The ministry promulgated regulations
about infrastructure sharing (roaming) and network
access, which meant new operators in their early
years would face lower costs in providing services
than incumbents. A follow-up mechanism was
designed to ensure that entrants would develop
infrastructure sufficient to enable them to compete
autonomously after several years.

technical in nature and drew little if any public

“Press coverage—positive coverage of the benefit
to consumers—was important to doing the
advocacy,” Dr. Wilson said. Other countries seeking
to foster more competitive business environments
through pro-competition policies have taken note
of Pakistan’s example. “There was no change
in law,” he said. Through advocacy and public
pressure and at least the possibility of sterner
enforcement action, “the bilateral agreement
between the airlines changed, and the cartel was
stopped.”

without consideration of the effect on competition. Regulatory
requirements and compliance procedures to enter the market,
sell a new product, or provide a new service may limit the ability
of new firms to enter and compete without contributing to an
identified policy objective, such as safety or public health. Policies
that aim at promoting the development of certain sectors or
regions may tilt the playing field, for example, if only a few firms
in the same market are aware of or eligible for state-provided aid.
Many competition authorities have understood the relevance of
cooperating with policy makers and public officials in the design of
norms to avoid regulations and policies that discriminate against
certain market players.

     Key Lessons
     1)	   Making marginal improvements to an
           anticompetitive regulatory environment
           can be a viable strategy. Confronted
           with a range of regulatory barriers to
           competition, ECA targeted achievable
           changes at the outset to produce
           demonstrable results, build capacity, and
           gradually strengthen the Competition
           Authority’s position to enforce the law.

     2)	 ECA recognized that businesses are
         not alone in originating conduct that
         discourages competition. The authority
         added the government and the judiciary
         to its advocacy and scrutiny, backed by
         a provision in Egypt’s constitution that
         prohibits anticompetitive practices.

Private market players are often unaware of the anticompetitive
nature of certain actions in the market, whether their own or their
competitors’. Also, they are often unaware of the sanctioning
power of the competition authority. Raising awareness can help
deter anticompetitive behavior, increase compliance efforts
within firms and trade associations and stimulate private
stakeholders affected by cartels or abuses of dominance to
report such behavior. Competition authorities recognize that
awareness of these issues among firms, entrepreneurs, and
consumers leverages their capacity to monitor behavior of
market players.

The Competition Authority engaged
directly with trade associations in
drafting guidelines to head off the
risk of collusion among association
members while also carrying out related
enforcement actions. The effort showed
positive impact in changing the overall
business culture of the country toward
a more pro-competition outlook.

Key Points:
»» A team from the National Economic Prosecutors
   Office identified and reported on the anticompeti-

»» Against strong initial resistance, the team opened

»» The team achieved a marked shift in attitudes
   toward competition and wider understanding of
   the contribution pro-competition practices can
   make to economic growth.

in a maturing economy would seem to imply a

providers and how much to use their services. The
council focused on a lack of transparency on the
actual costs of the services that was limiting the
incentives for competitors to make their service
packages more attractive to consumers.

By partnering with the National Regulatory Agency
for Electronic Communications and Information
Technology (NRAECIT), the Competition Council
managed to change industry practices. NRAECIT
specialists determined how consumers could be
informed about the effective price they would
pay for data service above the limit. By the end of
2012, two of the three providers had implemented
voluntary changes in procedure to ensure that sub-
scribers received notice when they were approach-
ing their traffic limits. These voluntary changes in
procedure will become mandatory under new rules
being adopted by NRAECIT. Now consumers can
compare more easily how much they will actually
pay for their monthly mobile Internet use and then
choose the best offer on the market.

This practice often enables the bid winner to
overcharge for goods and services at the expense
of taxpayers and health care recipients. By
allowing more firms to bid on a non-discriminatory
