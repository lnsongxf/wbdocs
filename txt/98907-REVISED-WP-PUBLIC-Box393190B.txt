    That is when it became clear that the same regulations have been
    implemented differently by the assessed three municipalities, thus
    creating this gap. In addition, a similar concern about sub-national

    and higher level authorities, but at the time no one could pin-point                                                                                              1. UNA-SANA CANTON

     We are making a distinction between deficiencies in the way regulations are implemented/enforced and the poor quality of implementing reforms. The former
    (regulatory implementation gap) is about the system as it is currently operating while the latter (reform implementation gap) is about attempts to change the
    system. Much of the focus of this note is on the former, i.e. changing the way the existing regulations are implemented and about how reforms supported by the
    project attempted to address the issue of regulatory implementation gap as it relates to licenses and permits in the former sense. However, the case study also
    touches upon the reform implementation gap, albeit to a lesser degree, i.e. changing the existing system of implementing reforms – quality, pace, consistency.

Defining the regulatory implementation gap
The regulatory implementation gap can be defined as the difference           Figure 1. Implementation gaps illustrated

function in reality. This is a concern for many countries worldwide
these days. The regulatory implementation gap is especially acute
in developing/transition economies. Over the years regulators have
emphasized the adoption or amendment of laws as the primary goal
of policy making. The assumption was that once a law is in place

its implementation will somehow automatically follow, and so the
anticipated results and impacts of reforms will be eventually gained
by the ‘simple’ adoption of the law. Therefore, the majority of efforts                  Gap 2: Intended vs Actual Interpretation

 The team didn’t conduct an in depth assessment of human resources management and incentive systems as part of the work in BiH that is described in
this case study. Some human capacity development activities were implemented in the form of capacity building programs and training of both government
authorities involved and private sector companies. Looking at the role of institutions, human resources management and incentives systems in enabling
implementation can be a follow on work on closing regulatory implementation and reform implementation gaps in the future.

  Over 320 companies from 16 localities (8 where project work was done and 8 more comparable localities where there was no project work) surveyed on the
impact of 8 comparable licenses/permits per locality (the most frequent or most burdensome were selected). Moreover, detailed statistical data analysis and
interviews with municipalities and cantons were completed. Full impact assessment study and findings can be obtained separately by contacting Tarik Sahovic

  On average it is 4.1% cheaper on cantonal level and 23.3% on municipal level in localities where project was implemented, compared to where it wasn’t. Also, on
average, firms spend 30% less time to file documents and complete procedure of applying for permit in localities where project was implemented.

  The Electronic registry is the online repository and data base of all licenses and permits in that jurisdiction. E-registry contains all information needed
regarding each of the procedures, including costs, documents, submission forms, and wait times among others. Based on impact assessment, on average, 60%
of firms use e-registers, which is significant. When comparing situations before and after e-registers, the majority of firms (2/3 of those under the survey who
used e-registers) confirmed that the time spent on procedures is now shorter and complexity has been reduced.

      Annex 1 – step by step regulatory simplification methodology applied

      Month 1 activities: administration, scoping and capacity building
      •	    Signing a cooperation/advisory agreement with the client.
      •	    Finalizing a client’s adoption of the relevant legal and regulatory decisions needed to enable the project to be implemented (establishment
            of a municipal working group; orders out to all civil servants to cooperate on the project; issuance of strict deadlines and procedures for
            civil servants to observe during project implementation, and the like).
      •	    Delivery of training to civil servants on the process of regulatory simplification and review.
      •	    Scoping the administrative procedures10 and analyzing the client’s capacities, followed by the identification and selection of possible
            counterparts.


      Month 2-3 activities: regulatory mapping and consultation process
      •	  Completing the regulatory mapping exercise of all administrative procedures administered by the client.
      •	  Collecting relevant economic data (and the frequency of all requests that the client has, fees, taxes, and any others).
      •	  Preparing and launching the consultation with the local business and civil community, seeking their input on the procedures, costs, and
          issues. Generally, stakeholder consultation is key throughout the entire process, from problem identification to solutions development
          to actual implementation of the solution.
      The team consults with both public sector officials at all levels and private sector companies that have undergone the process of receiving
      permits. This helps validate the problem, identify its scope and magnitude. Talking to businesses provides information that fosters
      understanding of the limitations and obstacles of specific licenses and permits and their actual implementation on the ground.


      Month 4-7 activities: recommendations for regulatory simplification
      •	   Analyzing the inventory of administrative procedures/licenses/permits.
      •	   Analyzing the legal basis for each procedure and identification of inconsistencies within higher-level regulations.
      •	   Comparing procedures with other locales within the same jurisdiction, and across jurisdictions with a view to harmonizing requirements.
      •	   Drafting recommendations for simplifying selected administrative procedures11 . The recommendations should be accompanied by
           justifications as to why the proposed solution should be seen as relevant and appropriate, what it will change if implemented and with
           what results.
      •	   Consulting with municipal officials on the quality of all recommendations, seek their feedback and input.
      •	   Completing an economic analysis (compliance cost savings) of baseline costs and estimated savings.
      •	   Finalizing recommendations for simplification and sending them for client approval.


      Month 8 activities: implementation of regulatory simplification
      •	   Design the E-Registry and complete the data entry.
      •	   Client adopts the recommendations for streamlining procedures.
      •	   The relevant client governing body/council adopts all necessary decisions (if any) to enable implementation of the proposed
           recommendations.
      •	   Implementation procedures begin.


      Month 9-12 activities: ensuring the sustainability of activities
      •	  Establish client’s permanent regulatory reform bodies’ monitoring work vis-à-vis the E Registry and control of the flow of the new
          administrative procedures. This body also monitors the introduction of new procedures.
      •	 Prepare the final inventory (meaning the final list of valid administrative procedures after the adoption and simplification processes are
          completed) and update the E-Registry accordingly.
      •	 Complete implementation of the proposed changes to simplify procedures for businesses.
      •	 Initiate evaluation of the project’s activities.
      •	 Verify the E-Registry testing. Launch the E-Registry.
      •	 Complete the monitoring and evaluation with businesses and verify implementation.
      The above activity list is indicative. It is provided only to give an idea of the type of activities the project has been involved in and the usual
      time line followed in their implementation. Naturally these activities, their sequence and time frames may differ depending on the context.

       The term administrative procedure includes all permits, approvals, certificates, authorizations, estimates, assignments, consents, and payments of charges
