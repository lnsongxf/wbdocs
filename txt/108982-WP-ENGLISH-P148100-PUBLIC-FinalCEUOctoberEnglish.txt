The Cambodia Economic Update (CEU) is a product of the staff of the World Bank Group. It was
prepared by Sodeth Ly and incorporates contributions by Miguel Eduardo Sánchez Martín, both at the
Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice (MFM GP). Linna Ky served as research
assistant. The team worked under the guidance of Mathew A. Verghis, Practice Manager, MFM GP. The
team is grateful for the comments, advice and guidance provided by Ulrich Zachau, Country Director,
Inguna Dobraja, Country Manager and Shabih Ali Mohib, Program Leader.

The CEU is produced bi-annually to provide up-to-date information on macroeconomic developments
in Cambodia. It is published and distributed widely to the Cambodian authorities, the development partner
community, the private sector, think tanks, civil society organizations and academia. The update is timed
to coincide with the six-monthly publication of the East Asia and Pacific Economic Update by the East
Asia MFM GP of the World Bank.

We received valuable inputs, comments and suggestions from Ahmad Ahsan, Lead Economist, East Asia
and Pacific Chief Economist Unit, while the poverty section was contributed by Obert Pimhidzai and
Kimsun Tong, at the Poverty Global Practice. The report also benefited from the advice, comments and
views of various stakeholders in the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), the private sector,
development partner institutions and academia. The team is very grateful for their time and inputs.

We are also grateful to the Cambodian authorities, in particular the Ministry of Economy and Finance and
the National Bank of Cambodia for their cooperation and support in the preparation of this CEU.

  2020 and adopting “Two Kingdoms, One

  the reduction in extreme poverty, the share of

  part because of limited human capital or other
  assets such as land. The challenge for Cambodia,
  is to close gaps in human development and build
  the foundations for a middle-class society, while
  also investing in programs to promote the
  resilience of households and help minimize their
  vulnerability (see the Poverty Sector for a more

Selected Issue – Cambodia’s Garment Sector in Perspective

I.         An overview of the garment sector
Cambodia started exporting garments in the mid-1990s and has withstood the increased competition in
world markets following the removal of quota, Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) quantitative restrictions in
2005. Underpinned by low wage, abundant labor and a liberal trade and investment regime, the labor
intensive industry has thrived in Cambodia and become a major source of foreign exchange. Investors have
brought in technology and supervisory personnel from abroad, which has helped overcome Cambodia’s
disadvantages in infrastructure and human capital. Given its nascent manufacturing sector, Cambodia’s
domestic supply chain and supporting industries for the garment sector are either insufficient or completely
missing. The industry therefore uses raw materials, fabric and other inputs imported mainly from China.
Frequent dialog and consultation under public-private sector forums have also helped to foster the sector.
The garment industry has therefore enjoyed strong production and employment growth, with an annual
production level of close to 200 million dozens produced by over 600 garment factors that employ more
than half a million workers.

Garment products are almost entirely exported, mainly to the European Union (EU) and the United
States (US). While export destination diversification has partly been achieved, the sector remains heavily
reliant on two main export markets, namely the EU and US markets, which together account for 73 percent
of total garment exports. The garment sector has now become the most dynamic driver of economic growth
for Cambodia. Last year, the garment (and footwear) sector accounted for one-third of total real growth.
Evidence also shows that garment production has moved up the value chain, while Cambodia’s market share
is also growing. The garment industry has therefore contributed significantly to economic growth,
employment and poverty reduction in Cambodia.

However, the sector is facing rising competition from regional low-wage countries, while
Cambodia’s minimum wage is rising. Myanmar is one of several emerging low-wage and abundant-labor
countries. Myanmar’s minimum wage, which is about two-thirds that of Cambodia, is currently boosting its
fast-growing garment industry.24 Meanwhile, anticipation of free trade access by Vietnam under the EU-
Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is fueling the appetite
for investing there, although in some cases, its tariff dismantling periods such as those on textiles and apparel
stretch from three to five years.25 Cambodia is currently enjoying “Everything But Arms” or “EBA”
preferential treatment under the EU’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP). When textile and apparel
tariff elimination under the EVFTA takes effect, Vietnam will compete with Cambodia for free access to the
EU market on an equal footing.26


24    Myanmar’s      minimum       wage      is    3,600     kyat    for    8-hour     work    or    about     US$89.4        a    month      since    2015.     See
http://www.nwpc.dole.gov.ph/pages/statistics/stat_comparative.html
25 Trans-Pacific Partnership aim at eliminating more than 18,000 taxes and other trade barriers among 12 countries: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,

Peru, the United States, Vietnam, Chile, Brunei, Singapore and New Zealand. The TPP Parties agree to eliminate tariffs on textiles and apparel and most
tariffs will be eliminated immediately, although tariffs on some sensitive products will be eliminated over longer timeframes as agreed by the TPP Parties.
However, there are specific rules of origin that require use of yarns and fabrics from the TPP region and a textile-specific special safeguard to respond to serious
damage or the threat of serious damage to domestic industry in the event of a sudden surge in imports . See https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-
office/press-releases/2015/october/summary-trans-pacific-partnership. For EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement. EU duties on textile apparel have dismantling
periods stretching from five to seven years for the more sensitive items and three years and entry into force for less sensitive goods. Footwear also receives the
longest EU staging of seven years for sensitive EU items and three years or entry into force on items which are less sensitive. The EU offered mostly duty-free
tariff rate quotas for Vietnamese rice exports. See http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/june/tradoc_154622.pdf.
26     Entry     into    the   EBA       is    automatic     and,    unlike   other    GSP     arrangements,      the     EBA      has    no    time-limit.    See

b.            Employment – jobs created by the sector are important to the economy.
 The sector created an annual average of 40,000 new jobs or a quarter of total annual job creation in the
 period 2010-15, while the number of garment factories increased by an average of 60 factories per year in
 the same period. In 2015, total employments reached 522,000 jobs, while the total number of factories was
 626 (Table S2).30 In 2016, employments created by the garment industry has increased further, driven largely
 by the growing number of subcontractors, although it remains to be established whether the number of
 garment factories increased during the first half of 2016.31 The garment sector also contributed indirectly to
 employment generation in retail, trade and transportation.

27 Presentation by Garment Manufacturers’ Association in Cambodia (GMAC) in April 2016.
28 Chinese FDI stocks in garment (and footwear) by end-2014 is estimated at 3.58 billion (3.95 x 90.5%) (Table 1B) or approximately 0.83 percent (3.58/430) of
total Chinese outward FDI with total Chinese outward FDI of US$ 430 billion during 2000-11. See the Transformation of the Clothing Industry in China, ERIA
discussion paper series (2015). Therefore, including additional Chinese outward FDI during 2012-2014, the share should be even smaller.
29 Based on a March 2016 Synthesis Report, presented by Garment Manufacturers’ Association in Cambodia (GMAC) in April 2016.
30 According to the Ministry of Commerce. However, different data sources provide different numbers of garment workers and factories, for instance, the Ministry

of Industry and Handicraft report showed there were 780 factories which employed 747,229 workers in 2015.
31 GMAC said more garment factory closures than opening during the first half of 2016. However, the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft reported in May 2016

that total garment factories is 803 employing 764,818 workers or 17,588 increase during the past 5 months of 2016. Some inconsistencies between employments
and garment factory numbers reported by the Ministry of Commerce and those by the Ministry of Industry.

a.               Garment exports
Garment production goes mainly towards exports. Garment exports are Cambodia’s largest earner of foreign
currency, generating US$ 6.2 billion (Figure S2) or 72 percent of total merchandise exports in 2015. Garment
exports continue to grow rapidly, except in 2009 when the global financial crisis hit Cambodia. Garment
exports have been expanding at an average year-on-year growth rate of 11 percent in value terms during the
                                                                     period 2010-15. Supported by export market

Garment exports to the EU—the largest export market—absorbed 42 percent (or US$1.9 billion) of total
garment exports and continue to drive Cambodia’s overall garment exports growth. However, garment
exports to the US, accounting for 31 percent (US$2.6 billion) of total garment exports, have already peaked.


32   While the garment sector seems to be shifting towards higher value-added products in 2015, it is necessary to examine detailed exported products and prices to
      confirm this.

Cambodia Economic Update October 2016 >> 26
Recently, strong garment exports growth (Figure S3) has been underpinned by the gradual recovery
in major high-income countries, in particular in the Euro area and the US. Garment exports
performance is expected to remain strong in 2016, given continuing high growth of imports of fabric, the
main input for garment production.
b.               Garment products
Unlike Vietnam, the garment industry in Cambodia was not built on earlier import-substituting
industrialization in textiles, but was developed almost entirely by an influx of foreign firms.33 The

As reflected in the Tables S4 and S5 above, over the past five years the evolution of the top ten
products appears to point to a rising share of more sophisticated and higher value added products.
Specifically, for both EU and US markets, there has been an expansion in women’s garments (HS 6104)
including women’s undergarments (HS 6108) versus less sophisticated articles (HS 6110) serving both men
and women. For the EU market, women’s articles favoring knitted or crocheted apparel under HS 61
(consistently identified in Box 1 on Exports of Textile and Apparel Articles – Cambodia is a strong competitor
for Vietnam in the EU market) are expanding faster than men’s articles, while for the US market, babies’
garments are rapidly emerging.

Retail brands sourcing from Cambodia include H&M, Nike, Levi, Old Navy, Adidas, Calvin Klein,
Gap, Puma, Clarks, Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Inditex, N Brown Group, Tchibo, Next, New Look, C&A,
Walmart and more.35

3.             Wages, output and gender

a. Wages
The minimum wage in the garment sector has increased rapidly over the past four years, averaging 23.1
percent during 2012-14 as it rose to US$140 a month in 2016 from US$61.0 a month in 2012 (Table S6).
The widespread labor unrest that occurred in late 2013 and early 2014 appears to have pressured the
minimum wage increases in 2014 and 2015. As a share of per capita GDP, the minimum wage in the garment
sector is rising, reaching 133 percent in 2015 (Figure S4). Minimum wages of Vietnam and Bangladesh are
also rising but at a slower pace than in Cambodia (Table S7). Minimum wages as a share of per capita GDP
in Vietnam and Bangladesh are 78 percent and 67 percent, respectively. The garment sector accounts for the
majority of paid employment in Cambodia and is the largest formal sector in the economy.

It is estimated that the total wages paid to garment workers in the entire country are worth about US$1.2
billion a year. The employment and remittances to their home areas of such a large pool of poorly educated
and mostly rural women turned garment workers has had a significant impact in terms of reducing poverty.

value) as a proxy, productivity can be roughly measured using the total garment products in volume (and in
value) terms and the total number of garment workers that produce them. Both volume and value of garment
exports per worker trended downwards in the period 2013-15. This may have been partly due to the negative
impacts of poor industrial relations with widespread labor unrest occurring in 2013 and 2014, resulting in
significant disruption to garment production as well as the reduction in overtime, reported by Garment
Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC).37

their families back in their home villages and to send their siblings to school. The role of women garment
workers therefore should not be underestimated. For most women, working in the garment industry is
perhaps their first experience of formal employment.38 Understanding working conditions including paid
annual, sick and maternity leave entitlements provided by the Labor Law will be important in promoting
good industrial relations.39

Living costs in the main cities where garment factories are located appear to be high. While wages
are rising, most garment workers still cannot afford to have children living with them due to the high cost
of accommodation and childcare expenses. Children are often forced to live with their grandparents back in
their home villages. Garment workers with children typically spend about 50 percent more than single
workers do on their children’s living and educational expenses.40

Established in 2002, the National Social Security Fund supports garment workers and its
members.41 Currently, two main schemes--occupational risk insurance and medical insurance--are
operational, with over one million participating members, of whom just under one million are members
employed in the garment and garment-related industries. For the occupational risk insurance scheme,
employers are required to contribute 0.8 percent of a worker’s average monthly wage, while the medical

39 Full time employees get 1.5 days of annual leave a month. This equals 18 days per year. The labor law does not require paid sick leave, however, following the
policy of the Ministry in charge of Labor, employers should consider providing paid sick leave as follows: (i) 100 percent of wages during the first month of sick
leave; (ii) 60 percent of wages during the second and third months; and (iii) unpaid leave from the fourth until the sixth month. Employers must give employees
who give birth 90 days (3 months) of maternity leave. Employers must pay employees who have at least one year of seniority half their wages and benefits during
maternity leave of 90 days. See http://betterwork.org/cambodia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodian-Labour-Law-Guide-English-2013.pdf

III.       Contribution to economic growth
Sustained robust economic growth averaging 7.6 percent per year during the past two decades would not
have been possible without the substantial contribution by the garment sector, one of the main engines of
growth. Specifically, the garment (and footwear) sector contributed an average of 2 percentage points to
annual real growth rate in the period 1995-2015 (Figure 7). The sector accounts for about 12 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and generates US$6.2 billion in export value (76 percent of total
exports in 2015), representing the largest share of Cambodia’s foreign currency earnings. To find out the
size of the contribution from the garment sector (as well as the industry sector) to output and employment
growth, decomposition is carried out below.

1.         Decomposing output growth and employment42
Using the Cambodia-Socio Economic Survey, the national accounts and garment and footwear employment
data, decomposition of value added growth and employment by sector is conducted during the period 1995-
2015. Thi is then further divided into three sub-periods, namely 1995-2000, 2000-09 and 2009-15 to look
more closely at the evolution of structural changes in each sub-period. As the existing classification in the
national accounts does not allow for disaggregation of the garment and footwear sector, the two segments
are analyzed as one.43

a.         Entire study period covering 1995-2015
The garment (and footwear) sector contributed substantially to real growth, accounting for about
30 percent of real growth during the past 20-year period. It contributed a 2.2 percentage points of the
7.7 percent real growth (Figure S6), while the entire industry sector’s contribution was 2.8 percentage
points.44

In terms of employment growth, the garment (and footwear) sector’s contribution was modest,
accounting for 0.7 of a percentage point (Figure S7). This represents one quarter of total employment
growth during this period which is relatively high at 2.7 percent, while the entire industry sector contributed
as much as 1.9 percentage points.

b.         Sub-periods
Strong performance in the 1995-2000 sub-period: the contribution made by the garment sector to real growth
was the largest among the three sub-periods. This reflected rapid expansion of garment exports, albeit
from a very low base, growing at an average rate of 84 percent a year. During this period, the garment sector
accounted for 3.1 percentage points of 7.6 percent real growth. This was above the contribution by the entire
industry sector which accounted for only 2.9 percentage points. However, the garment sector’s
contribution to employment growth during this sub-period remained modest at 0.8 of a percentage

43 The footwear sector was relatively small, with a total export value of less than US$ 100 million a year prior to 2010, while total garment sector export value
reached as much as US$ 2.5 billion in 2010. Export value of the footwear sector, however, expanded rapidly, reaching US$ 660 million in 2015.
43 Slightly different periods: 1996-2013 for Vietnam and 1996-2010 for Lao PDR due to non-availability of data of the two countries in WDI.

point (similar to that of the entire study period) of total employment growth during this sub-period which
was the highest at 3.7 percent.

Deceleration in the 2000-09 sub-period: the garment and footwear sector contributed the smallest due largely
to decelerating garment export performance in the run up to the 2008-09 global financial crisis, at 1.5
percentage points to real growth, while this sub-period witnessed real growth rising fastest, at 8.2 percent.
The garment sector also contributed the least, at 0.2 of a percentage point of total 2.6 percent
employment growth.

Recovery in the 2009-15 sub-period: the garment and footwear sector contributed handsomely at 1.9
percentage points to real growth of 7.6 percent. The entire industry sector, however, accounted for the
largest contribution, at 3.3 percentage points, reflecting new emerging sectors such as the construction and
other manufacturing sectors which grew rapidly during this sub-period. For employment growth, the
garment sector accounted for 0.8 of a percentage point of total employment growth during this sub-
period which was 2.1 percent.

As discussed above, it is clear that while the garment sector contributes significantly to real growth,
it only generates modest growth in employment. Moreover, it is important to note that structural
transformation of the economy has led to a steady decline in total employment growth which dropped from
3.7 percent during 1995-2000 sub-period to 2.6 percent in 2000-09 sub-period and 2.1 percent in 2009-15
sub-period while Cambodia’s working age population (15-64 years) grew at an average rate of 2.6 percent
per year during the period 2009-14, rising to 10 million persons in 2014 from 8.8 million persons in 2009.45

2.               Garment sector evolution - international evidence

There may still be some scope for Cambodia’s garment sector to expand further. Cambodia’s real
GDP per capita (at constant 2009 US dollar) reached only US$1,055 in 2015 which appears to be below a

Cambodia is experiencing a similar evolution to Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines when their garment
exports were diversified before their per capita garment exports began to decline and the subsequent
contraction of their garment sectors. Cambodia’s garment sector is experiencing rising wages, the erosion of
competitiveness in basic garments and a gradual moving-up the value chain witnessed largely by the recent
increase in the average export price of its garments.

3.                                       World market share of Cambodia’s garment exports
 Cambodia’s share of the world’s garment export markets has edged up steadily, rising to 2.02 percent in
2015 from 0.9 percent in 2011 (Table S8). Similarly, Cambodia’s shares in the EU and US markets have been
rising from 2.16 percent and 0.93 percent in 2011 to 5.07 percent and 2.5 percent in 2015, respectively. As
Cambodia’s GDP per capita is still below the threshold, its garment export growth may be sustainable at

Foreign investors, in particular those that invest in the garment sector in Cambodia, continue to find political
stability, a relatively cheap, young and rising labor force, liberal investment and trade policies and preferential
access under the EBA GSP to the EU market as favorable conditions attracting their investment. 48 It is likely
that Cambodia will continue to be eligible for EBA preferential access for at least the next 11 years.49

An effective minimum wage-setting mechanism has been established. A tripartite Labor Advisory
Committee consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training, employer
associations and trade unions has so far been successful in handling annual minimum wage negotiations
since 2014.50 This helps maintain good industrial relations after the widespread labor unrest in 2013 and 2014
disrupted the garment sector and had a negative impact on investors’ confidence. All related parties, namely
garment workers, unions and factory owners appear to have developed a better understanding of the
importance of the garment industry and their mutual interests, as well as the challenges and constraints the
industry faces, and as a result, all stakeholders are now working more effectively together to overcome them.

http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_150983.pdf
49 Cambodia’s eligibility under EBA is expected to continue until it is no longer classified as ‘least developed’ by the UN Cambodia is currently classed as “least
developed country or LDC” by the United Nations. Graduation thresholds (2015 triennial review): (i) Per capita GNI: $1,242; (ii) Human Asset Index (HAI): 66
and above; and (iii) Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI): 32 and below. (Cambodia was classified as a lower-middle income economy by the World Bank Group.
Cambodia’s GNI per capita (Atlas method) for 2015 is estimated at $1,070 above the threshold for Low Income, which is set at $1,025 for Bank’s 2017 fiscal
year.) Eligibility for graduation has to be met at two consecutive triennial reviews (2+3) and graduation takes effect three years (3) after the decision by the
General Assembly. When Cambodia is graduated from the LDC, the EU will provide a transition period of three years (3), during which time EBA preferences
will continue to apply. See http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_150983.pdf and

                                                     will give Vietnam a “level playing field” to compete
                                                     for the EU market with Cambodia which is currently
 enjoying the EU’s EBA preferential treatment with full duty free and quota-free access for all products.
 Currently, Vietnam mostly faces 12 percent customs tariff for the same garment products that Cambodia
 largely exports duty free to the EU. Vietnam still maintains a similar market share, compared with
 Cambodia’s in the EU market (see Box 1). While rules of origin are still required, once it takes effect,
 theoretically, the EVFTA will immediately eliminate most tariff lines on garment products under
 Harmonized System (HS) codes 6104 and 6204 (Table S4) (currently classified under Category A of the EU
 tariff schedule), which account for about one quarter, or US$700 million of Cambodia’s total exports58 to
 the EU.59 Let’s assume that Vietnam’s duty free access to the EU market upon ratifying the EVFTA could
 result in a drop of 12 percent of Cambodia’s EU market share or US$ 350 million (or about half of the
 export value of the impacted products) of Cambodia’s exports to the EU market.60 In this case, real growth
 could potentially decline by up to 1.5 percentage points.61

 However, potential negative impacts on Cambodia’s garment exports may not fully materialize soon
 after the EVFTA becomes effective. This may be due to a number of factors which include the time lags
 in garment supply response by Vietnam while Cambodia already operates within global value chains. Another
 factor is the rules of origin which are often difficult to qualify (note that Cambodia’s garment exports to the
 EU have expanded substantially only after 2011 when the EU relaxed EBA’s rules of origin requirements).62
 It also depends how competitive Cambodia’s garment sector will be at the time when EVFTA takes effect,
 given that skills gap may be addressed by the recent establishment of the Cambodian Garment Training
 Institute.

 Tariff elimination provided by the EVFTA for other competing products such as those under HS codes
 6110, 6109, and 6203 (currently classified under Category B5 of the EU tariff schedule), which cover about
 three-quarters of Cambodia’s exports to the EU market, will be removed within a seven-year period after
 the free trade agreement takes effect.63 According to the existing EU tariff schedule, the tariff reduction for
58Cambodia’s total exports are projected to be US$ 6.9 billion in 2016. The EU and the US markets account for 40 percent (or US$2.8 billion) and 30 percent (or
 US$2.0 billion), respectively
 59 Products are considered originating under the agreement if they meet one of the following requirements: (i) wholly obtained in Vietnam; or (ii) products produced

 in Vietnam incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing
 within Vietnam. See http://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/eu-vietnam-fta-understanding-rules-origin.html/

 61 Arbitrarily assuming that only half of export value of the impacted products may be drop due to Vietnam’s duty free access to the EU market upon ratifying the

 free trade agreement. Everything else being equal, this will shave off about 1.5-1.8 percentage points from the real growth. However, it may not happen within
 one year because order and supply responses lag (even though those tariff lines will be immediately zero).
 62 See Box I.B.2. Cambodia’s Garment Sector, October 2016 East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, the World Bank Group
 63 The EU will also eliminate duties with longer staging periods (up to 7 years) for some sensitive products, especially in the textile apparel and footwear sectors.

 The elimination of duties, however, will not be an open door for Chinese products to flood the EU market: to benefit from the preferential access, the strict rules

these products will be implemented in six equal annual stages.64 This will likely allow the garment industry in
Cambodia to adjust.65

                        b. Brexit
While the United Kingdom (UK) is Cambodia’s third largest trading partner in the world, after the
US and Germany, it absorbs only 10 percent (or US$800 million) of Cambodia’s exports (Figure S10).66
The UK market therefore accounts for about 28 percent of Cambodia’s exports to the EU. Of the total
exports to the UK, garment and footwear exports account for 76 percent (or US$600 million) and 17 percent
(US$200 million), respectively.67 While it is clear that Cambodia will likely lose some garment (and footwear)
market share in the UK market (perhaps to Vietnam), if the UK after leaving the EU, fails to grant Cambodia
duty free access to its market (as it currently does as part of the EU’s EBA preferential treatment), it is likely
that the negative impacts on Cambodia’s garment (and footwear) exports are likely to be insignificant.
Let’s assume that without duty free access to the UK market, Cambodia’s garment exports to the UK could
drop by 12 percent or US$70 million. In this case, real growth could potentially decline by about 0.3
percentage point (or about 0.4 percentage point, if potential negative impacts on footwear exports are
included).

                        c. Trans-Pacific Partnership
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will place Cambodia at a disadvantage vis-à-vis Vietnam, if
ratified. TPP will allow Vietnam to obtain preferential treatment for its exports to TPP members, in
particular the US (and Canadian) market, accounting for about US$ 2.0 billion (or 30 percent of total garment
exports) which is currently the second largest market for Cambodia’s garment exports, after the EU market.70

of origin for garments will require the use of fabrics produced in Vietnam, with the only exception being of fabrics produced in South Korea, another FTA partner
of the EU. See http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5468_en.htm
64 For detailed EU tariff schedule, see http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154200.pdf
65 The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement is reportedly on the course of being legally reviewed before ratification and the entry into force of the Agreement is

tentatively foreseen in 2018. See http://www.ambhanoi.esteri.it/ambasciata_hanoi/en/ambasciata/news/dall_ambasciata/2016/06/accordo-di-libero-scambio-

While rules of origin and safeguards will still apply,71 the tariff schedule of the US allows for immediate
elimination for most of the tariff lines, ranging from 0.9 percent to 28.2 percent, for the HS codes
representing Cambodia’s top ten garment products shown in Table S5.72 Unlike under the EVFTA which
only about US$700 million of garment exports value will be immediately hit, the TPP will affect almost the
entire Cambodia’s garment exports to the US market at once when TPP takes effect. The potential negative
impacts will be even greater, if the Canadian market is included. The TPP therefore presents a more
challenging threat to Cambodia’s garment industry (and growth) than the EVFTA.

Again, potential negative impacts on Cambodia’s garment exports may not fully materialize soon
after the TPP takes effect due to similar factors discussed in under the EVFTA above. An additional
factor for the US market is safeguards which may help protect the US market against a sudden surge in
garment exports from Vietnam. The safeguards may therefore provide Cambodia’s garment industry time to
adjust.

V. Conclusion
Given the “footloose” characteristics of its garment industry together with the existing ownership
structure whereby there are only a handful of domestic investors, garment factories can be relocated
relatively quickly from Cambodia to more attractive countries, if they face a squeeze in profit margins
due to rising input costs, higher taxes, less favorable preferential trade treatment, or an economic slowdown
in key export markets. Promoting local participation in the garment industry will therefore be important
including encouraging more supporting industries to the garment sector from locally-owned small and
medium-sized enterprises. Promoting joint ventures and partnerships between domestic and foreign
investors may also be a way forward.

There are significant risks of investment and export diversion away from Cambodia unless key
constraints, such as high energy and transportation costs and infrastructure bottlenecks are
successfully addressed. This will require more attention and facilitation from the public sector.73 The
garment industry is exposed to increasing competition from Vietnam which has also developed upstream in
the sector together with emerging competition from Myanmar which is opening up to foreign investment.

Given potentially large negative impacts of the EVFTA and severe consequences of TPP on
Cambodia’s garment exports, it will be important to devise a concrete plan to improve
competitiveness and diversifying export sectors. Structural reforms to make Cambodia’s tradeable sector
more competitive is core to improving competitiveness of the economy. Current investment which is heavily
concentrated in the non-tradeable sectors, namely the construction and real estate sectors may not bode well
for Cambodia’s future economic success and policy support could encourage the tradeable sectors to be
further strengthened to become more competitive.

One further policy option may therefore be oriented towards boosting high value-added garment
products by encouraging the garment industry to gradually add value to its products and to vertically
integrate to the extent possible. This may also lead to diversification beyond garments as envisaged under
the 2015-25 Industrial Development Policy. It is also important to further strengthen and deepen dialog and
consultation under public-private sector forums to continue to foster the sector.

73 GMAC has reported that its membership is stagnant, suggesting that it is possible that additional investment has slowed.


Cambodia Economic Update October 2016 >> 38
While the garment sector contributes substantially to real growth, it only generates a modest
number of jobs. An important economic policy aimed at creating jobs to absorb a rising number of entrants
into the labor force of about 160,000 a year will need to focus on other sectors as well, especially the
agriculture sector, given that the majority (70 percent) of the population resides in rural areas. While real
growth remains robust, the recent structural transformation has resulted in a steady decline in employment
growth, which dropped to 2.1 percent during the period 2009-15, down from 3.7 percent during period
1995-2000 while Cambodia’s working age population (15-64 years) continue to increase, growing at an
average rate of 2.6 percent per year during the period 2009-14.

It will be important to maintain good industrial relations and avoid the disruption of production
and exports. Past experience has shown the costs and negative impact on investor confidence of poor
industrial relations and all related parties, namely garment workers, unions and factory owners appear to
have better understanding of the importance of the garment industry and their mutual interests, as well as
the challenges and constraints the industry faces and all are now working more effectively together to
overcome them. Addressing labor issues promptly and at their root cause may be the way forward.
Education and awareness programs on important topics such as the Labor Law, corporate social
responsibility, macroeconomic conditions, and the roles and responsibilities of unions and workers may also
help to promote a better understanding and improved industrial relations going forward.
