		       - Leadership and coordination with other public entities.
		       - Dialogue and negotiations with the private sector.

 •	     Consumers view the public-private joint effort on behalf of the public’s health as a positive
        development, which helps improve the companies’ image.


   Opportunities
  •	  An international climate inclined to work on promoting healthy diets.
  •	  Increasing consumer demand for healthy food.
  •	  The creation of an intersectoral working group that led to modifying the Food Code.


   Weaknesses
  •	  Insufficient resources for launching mass campaigns to disseminate information and for
      strengthening strategies to bring more bakeries, as well as small and medium enterprises,
      on board.
  •	  Small and medium enterprises are missing in the discussion about measures.
  •	  Monitoring and evaluation: need for laboratory standardization to perform the tests.
  •	  Sodium: the voluntary agreements do not have enforcement power.


  Threats
 •	   Companies may request extensions to achieve the goals (particularly with regard to redu-
      cing sodium).
 •	   Monitoring and evaluation:
		      - Questions about the capacity and availability of laboratories.
		      - Limited baseline information.
 •	   Transnational companies that set their policies at the global level can hinder the agreed
      upon agreements.
 •	   Lack of policy continuity over time due to management changes.

       On many occasions between 1984 and 2004, the Executive Branch tried to reduce the transfers
       to the FET. For example, Decree 455 of 1999 provided for a 12% reduction, and the 2001 budget
       stipulated a 50% reduction; however, none went into effect. On the contrary, in 2008, Law 26,467
       established measures to compensate the agro-industrial chain, the regional economies that
       depend on tobacco production, and the fiscal collection for the potential damage caused by the
       tobacco control measures, increasing the amount of the FET. The law was submitted along with
       another regulation on health measures (file 0039-EP-2008, presented to the Chamber of Re-
