Box 1: Higher Education System in Guinea

 Higher education in Guinea is composed of 17 public institutions, 10 of which are outside of Conakry, and 39 private institutions. There
 are 3 universities, 14 higher education institutions, and 1 institution offering distance programs. Of the 39 private institutions, 35 are in
 Conakry. 30 research and documentation institutions are spread over the country.
    Academic Programs: 75 bachelor degree programs (licence), around 20 master programs, and 7 specialized programs in medicine
 and pharmacy, are offered in public institutions. The same programs are offered in private institutions, although the latter primarily of-
 fer programs in law, political science, economics, business administration, marketing, ICT, and English, excluding science and technical
 programs. Ph.D. programs are rare. In 2011, only two PhD theses were presented. The proportion of masters and PhD students is very
 small. At the University of Sonfonia, which has about 19,000 students, only 287 students were enrolled at the masters and Ph.D. levels
 (1.5 percent), while the figure was only close to 8 percent in other universities in the sub-region.
    Over the past few years, technical bachelor degree programs (licences professionnelles) are being offered by the Institut Polytech-
 nique de l’Université de Conakry, Ecole Supérieure du Tourisme et Hotellerie, Institut des Mines et Géologie de Boké, and the Institut
 Supérieur de Technologie de Mamou. These programs link training more closely to the emerging needs of the labor market in the
 mining, agriculture, industrial production, and hospitality sectors.

Box 2: Licence-Master-Doctorate Reform in Africa

 Licence-Master-Doctorate (LMD)
 The Licence-Master-Doctorate (LMD) reform is a series of steps taken to ensure that the higher education system in Guinea (and other
 African states) can meet international standards. The genesis of the LMD reforms can be traced to the Bologna process, where in June
 1999, 29 countries signed a pact “aimed at harmonizing degree structures and quality assurance procedures across their diverse higher
 education systems by 2010” (WENR, 2007, page 1). The LMD reform was first adopted in Africa by the West African Economic and Monetary
 Union (UEMOA)a in 2007 by decree no. 03/2007/CM/UEMOA. The aims of the reform were to: “(a) improve the efficiency and performance
 of institutions of higher education; (b) promote a sub-regional system open to the world, able to develop joint mechanisms for promoting
 quality; and (c) ensure international recognition of degrees issued by the institutions of higher education in UEMOA countries” (Okebukola,
 2014, page 5). The African and Malagasy Council of Higher Education (CAMES) coordinates the LMD reform process within the region and
 oversees accreditation and quality assurance. The reforms are implemented at the sub regional, national, and institutional levels.

 Successful Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
 International experience in higher education, professional training, and research and development has proven the feasibility and
 viability of public-private partnerships.

 1.	Engagement in joint training, research, or development to meet specific needs identified by the private partner. In Tunisia,
    professional degrees and applied masters degrees built jointly with and for professionals were introduced in 2008 in response
    to the national objectives on improving the employability of young graduates. Set up in emerging sectors (mechanics,
    retail, aerospace, food processing, etc.) at the request and with the active participation of professionals at every level of
    preparation, implementation, and evaluation, the training programs boast an employment rate of nearly 100 percent; a
    number of these trainings benefitted from grants from the Tunisian competitive fund for quality improvement (Programme
    d’appui à la Qualité) funded under the PARESII (World Bank loan).
 2.	A Government and a firm or group of firms/professional sectors/private foundation for the creation and management of a
    professional training institution. In Morocco, the Institut des Métiers de l’Aéronautique (Institute for Aeronautical Trades)
    is managed by an anonymous firm, IMA-Sa, to whom the Moroccan state has entrusted infrastructure and equipment
    management. In Tunisia, the Centre d’Excellence dans les Métiers de l’Industrie Aéronautique (Center of Excellence in the
    Aeronautics Industry Trades) is a pilot initiative of the Ministry of Professional Training and Employment in partnership
    with the Ministry of Higher Education, piloted by two national federations of mechanisms and electricity and electronics.
 3.	TVET training programs have been conducted by both private and public institutes independent of each other. In Bangladesh,
    recently, there have been some partnerships, but they are mostly initiated by non-governmental organizations. For example, a
    Garment Workers’ Education Program has been set up to provide basic and vocational education to eligible former garment
    workers. The program is a partnership between the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers Export Association, United Nations
    Children’s Fund and the International Labor Organization (Tansen, 2012).
 4.	Professional associations and professional sectors are set up for initial and vocational training in response to the needs of
    a given sector. In France, Union des Industries et des Métiers de la Métallurgie is a consortium bringing together Industry
    Professional Associations (Associations professionnelles de l’Industrie) for vocational education and training and the
    Industry Apprentices Training Centers (Centres de formation d’apprentis de l’Industrie) for initial training from the CAP
    to the engineering degree. The professional associations and apprentice training centers are nonprofit organizations,
    autonomously managed by firms.
