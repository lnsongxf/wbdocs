About this Report
This report draws on international experiences in developing the global outsourcing services (GOS)
industry—including the emerging concept of online outsourcing (OO)—to explore new and innovative
ways to overcome the unique geographic and demographic challenges of the Pacific Island Countries
(PICs), and create more inclusive jobs, particularly for youth and women. The report positions the GOS
industry as a possible starting point for PICs to harness the potential of ICTs by creating an enabling
environment for technology transfer, innovation, and digital entrepreneurship.

Executive Summary
The Pacific region is in the midst of an information and communication technologies (ICT) revolution in
which small island countries are increasingly connected to the global economy. The region's improving
Internet connectivity presents an opportunity for Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to overcome their inherent
limitations, and help address the long-standing issues of employment and income generation, which is vital
to accelerate progress towards ending poverty and creating an inclusive society.

The PICs possess unique vulnerabilities that make addressing poverty and development challenges
particularly difficult and complex. These include geographical remoteness from major global markets,
small country size, limited natural and human resources, cultural and ethnic diversity, aid dependency, and
vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. The high youth population and growing youth
unemployment in the region is a particularly pressing development challenge for the PICs. An estimated
23 percent of the potential youth labor force is unemployed, reflecting only the formal sector and omitting
those in casual, low-paid, or subsistence occupations. In some countries unemployment is estimated to be
as much as 58 percent. Hence, the consideration of ICT-based and other employment options is not only
timely, but also necessary.

The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of leveraging ICT to help generate job opportunities
in the PICs. This is because of the positive experiences that several countries, including small island
economies, have had in generating new types of employment opportunities. It analyzes the job creation
prospects in this area for Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (hereafter referred to as the "three countries") as a first
phase in a broader review of the Pacific. The study’s main focus is on cities and urban areas, given the still
low availability of Internet infrastructure and services in rural and remote areas and islands in the Pacific
region.

The study focuses specifically on the IT-enabled global outsourcing services (GOS) industry. ICT covers
diverse subsectors that include telecommunications and IT hardware and software. International experience
has demonstrated that the GOS industry can bring significant employment to developing countries – such
as India with 3.1 million direct jobs, or Mauritius with 18,000 direct jobs – particularly benefitting women
and young people.

Outsourcing generally refers to a production strategy in which a business chooses the most cost- efficient
location for delivery of services for their internal operations and/or external clients, even if the service is
produced in a foreign country. The GOS industry therefore includes nearshoring and offshoring, those
aspects of outsourcing produced abroad, and includes diverse types of services in IT (ITO), business
processes (BPO, including voice or nonvoice-based), and knowledge processes (KPO).

According to KPMG, in 2013 the global market size of the GOS industry was estimated at $952 billion per
year, with ITO's share at $648 billion and BPO's at $304 billion. GOS was expected to grow at a
compounded annual growth rate of 4.7 percent and 6.0 percent for BPO to 2017. Of this total, the estimated
global market size for nearshoring and offshoring was estimated at $140 billion per year. This international
market is more relevant for the purposes of this study, since it excludes the larger onshoring market. The
GOS market size for the Asia Pacific (APAC) was estimated at $188 billion per year in 2013. The Australia
and New Zealand market could be of particular interest for the PICs, which was estimated at $31 billion
per year, and represented 17 percent of the total Asia Pacific market. India continues to lead as the global
outsourcing services destination, while China, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines
have also positioned themselves as top-tier destinations. Small island economies are also competitive and
are benefitting from this global industry, with Mauritius and Jamaica recognized among the offshoring
leaders in their respective regions.

Fiji is the only country in the Pacific Islands with industry experience in GOS. The country already hosts
major offshoring operations for ANZ Pacific Operations and Mindpearl, both BPO-focused operations sited
in the Kalabu Tax Free Zone operated and administered by the Fiji Trade and Investment Bureau
(Investment Fiji). ANZ Pacific currently has an estimated 400 workers, while Mindpearl has 660 workers.
Fiji also won the European Outsourcing Association‘s Offshoring Destination of the Year Award in 2014
(Lewis 2014; Mindpearl 2014), which acknowledges destinations and operators that have most successfully
serviced the UK and other European outsourcing markets.

Online outsourcing (OO) is a new GOS industry approach that has emerged in recent years. OO refers to
the performance of tasks conducted over the Internet by workers from anywhere in the world, using online
marketplaces or exchanges. These online marketplaces provide clients with access to a global labor pool of
workers, and provide a platform on which workers can perform and deliver their work. The global OO
industry is highly diverse and evolving. It also covers different types of tasks, from low complexity
activities such as data entry and website sign-up, to high complexity ones such as web/software
development and accounting services.

The market size for OO was estimated at about $2 billion in 2013, which is a fraction of the total GOS
market. There are already numerous OO marketplaces across the world. Industry experts suggest that the
top three platforms (Elance-oDesk, Freelancer.com, and Zhubajie/Witmart) account for about 50 percent
of the market; of these three firms, Elance-oDesk is the clear market leader, with $750 million of combined
revenue in 2013.

Online outsourcing offers new benefits and value for global outsourcing services players. It also represents
a unique and new opportunity to provide employment and incomes for masses of youth and women. It is
particularly attractive for PICs because it enables these countries to completely transcend their inherent
challenges of size and geography.

The job creation potential of the GOS is significant – the traditional nearshoring and outsourcing industry
is expected to create an additional four million direct jobs worldwide by 2016. Further, every direct job
created in this industry is estimated to produce indirect employment for about 2.5 people in other sectors.
On the other hand, OO sources (World Bank 2015b) suggest that that there are currently 48 million workers
globally registered on online working platforms, and about 10 percent of them (4.8 million in total) are
actively completing tasks.

Creating employment in the GOS industry could also bring about other socioeconomic benefits for PICs.
International experience suggests that the development of a vibrant local GOS industry generates positive
spillovers to other sectors of the economy by facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, fostering local
innovation, and driving positive social change for women.

Nevertheless, the positive job creation implications of the GOS industry will also have to be considered in
the broader development context of the region. As mentioned above and suggested by the World Bank's
2014 publication on Well-being from Work in the Pacific Island Countries:

[W]hile business environment reforms can open up new opportunities for private sector development and
employment creation, such measures are unlikely to spur sufficient work to meet emerging demands even
in the best possible business environment.

It is important to have quantitative estimates of the impact that the global outsourcing services industry may
have on a country to better understand its potential, and to facilitate decision making in industry
development initiatives. This study's optimistic-case estimates indicate that the direct jobs potential is
highly significant. For Fiji, for instance, the GOS industry could create 5,809 direct jobs, a fivefold increase
of the current direct number of employees in its existing BPO operations. The conservative estimate indicate



                                                       3
                                                                                      Report No: 96218-EAP


that the direct jobs potential remains significant, since it is higher than current employment in some of the
established industries in the countries. For Fiji, for instance, the conservative estimate still indicates more
direct formal employment than the combined total of the country's agriculture, forestry, and fishing
industrial sector (1,936 as compared to 1,604).

Previous research has identified the criteria for competitiveness and success. The four key dimensions
determining a country‘s “locational competitiveness” are:

    •   Quality and quantity of talent,
    •   Competitive costs,
    •   Quality of relevant public infrastructure, and
    •   Enabling environment.

These four dimensions form a common unified framework for assessment, which has been used by the
World Bank for numerous country assessments. This study also used SWOT analysis to assess the
competitiveness of the PICs in global outsourcing based on these four dimensions, and found the following
key competitive advantages for the three countries:

    •   The availability of a small labor pool that is young and qualified for basic voice or nonvoice BPO
        tasks. This labor pool is the youngest in the world (in terms of youth bulge and unemployment), is
        relatively well educated, has a high level of English skills, and is comparatively computer literate.
    •   Minimum wage costs are comparable to the international norm for basic outsourcing tasks.
    •   The availability of basic Internet infrastructure that is improving in terms of speed, quality, and
        cost owing to new and ongoing connectivity initiatives.
    •   The availability of at least one international micropayment mechanism, such as PayPal, Payoneer,
        or Skrill, in each country.
    •   A high level of political support for ICT initiatives resulting in connectivity improvements.
    •   Basic investment incentives are in place, but only Fiji has highly competitive ICT sector specific
        incentives.
    •   A higher ranking in terms of the ease of doing business than the leading global outsourcing services
        players, such as India and the Philippines.
    •   The emergence of a local global outsourcing services industry – Fiji already hosts some GOS
        operations, and in 2014 won the Offshoring Destination of the Year Award by the European
        Outsourcing Association.
    •   The ability to offer unique, nearshoring services to Australia and New Zealand. The benefits for
        potential clients include ease of management and operations owing to close proximity or similar
        time zones, relatively shorter distances than the nearest competitors, and cultural and business
        affinity. In addition there is a positive association with PICs because of their image as tourist
        destinations.

The analysis also found several competitive disadvantages:

    •   The population and labor pool is small, limiting the ability to serve large clients, as well as the
        industry’s potential size and impact on jobs.
    •   Although minimum wage costs for basic BPO work are comparable with global benchmarks, this
        could limit cost savings for potential clients. Since the three countries are relatively new industry
        entrants in a largely mature global market, potential clients could be deterred.
    •   Uncertainty surrounds the youth’s ability and willingness to perform quality BPO tasks, since their
        wage expectations are higher than their country's minimum wage, and are as high as those paid to
        workers in proven countries like Mauritius.
    •   Internet costs for businesses and individuals are still relatively high.

    •   There is limited awareness of, and virtually no experience in, OO.
    •   Potential clients have limited awareness and experience of the region as an outsourcing destination.

The findings may also be viewed from various industry specific dimensions:

    By the three countries: Fiji is significantly more ready than Samoa or Tonga for GOS industry
    development, especially in terms of connectivity, infrastructure, and existing BPO operational
    experience.

    By ITO/BPO/KPO subsectors: BPO may be more feasible for the three countries in the immediate to
    short term. It may not be feasible to compete on ITO, and KPO may not be feasible for now because of
    the limited quantity and quality of necessary talent.

    By task segments: The three countries do not appear to have obvious or particular areas of strengths or
    specialization for niche offerings, such as in graphic design or accounting services.

    By source markets: There is an opportunity to target Australia and New Zealand as the primary market,
    and the United Kingdom and Europe as secondary markets.

    By operational and client size: The three countries are likely to be more successful by servicing mainly
    small (<$10 million revenue) or emerging-sized clients ($10 to 100 million revenue), but are unlikely
    to be able to serve enterprise-size clients. The three countries could also target medium-sized companies
    because of their growing global demand for GOS.

    By traditional versus OO approaches: Both approaches are complementary and are not mutually
    exclusive. The PICs are likely to be more competitive in OO than traditional approaches
    (nearshoring/offshoring), but the overall job impact may be higher for traditional outsourcing because
    of its significantly larger global market size.

In conclusion, the global outsourcing services industry appears to have significant job creation potential in
Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Improving connectivity has made it more feasible for the PICs to examine GOS as
a new and innovative channel for job creation. Beyond this, the three countries can develop a completely
new industry with additional contribution to GDP and such a new service-based, digital economy industry
for the PICs could also contribute to the region’s next phase of growth and development.

The comparative advantages are currently restricted to the three countries having the youngest workforce
in the world, the ease of doing business, and the nearshoring opportunity with Australia and New Zealand.
These are the main selling points that the three countries could use for their industry development initiatives.
Fiji could also leverage its existing GOS experiences and its attractive investment incentives for setting up
BPO operations.

International practice suggests that creating an enabling policy environment is necessary but not sufficient
for the GOS industry to flourish, especially in the relatively mature ITO/BPO/KPO subsector. The general
recommendation is for the three countries to take a phased and focused approach to develop their country’s
global outsourcing services industry, starting with two industry development pilots in a selected lead
country. One of the pilots could be for nearshoring/offshoring businesses and the other for OO. Fiji, given
its advanced readiness, is best placed to conduct the two global outsourcing services industry development
pilots on a trial and error basis to provide the practical analytical basis for longer-term industry development
efforts, both within the country and for others in the region. The total cost is estimated at $5 million over
1.5 years if both pilots are implemented concurrently.

From a Pacific, region-wide industry development perspective, the PICs should also consider taking a
“flying geese” approach in their efforts to grow their respective GOS industry (National Graduate Institute


                                                       5
                                                                                     Report No: 96218-EAP


for Policy Studies). Hence the possible sequence or pattern for PICs could have Fiji as the lead country to
conduct pilot industry development programs, with Tonga and Samoa in the next phase, and with the
remaining PICs in the final phase.
The proposed pilots for Fiji should take a conservative approach in terms of targeted industry services
segments or tasks. There is also a need to bring in international expertise for the pilots, as knowledge and
experience is required for the countries to compete effectively in this global industry. Depending on the
pilot projects’ success, Fiji could also conduct a medium to long-term industry development project in the
next phase. This next stage of industry development would aim to consolidate early competitive strengths,
expand industry coverage, and move up the value chain. The pilots would also provide a more concrete
foundation to identify the critical success factors for long-term GOS industry development in the piloted
country, and focus on these during the next stage of industry development.
The traditional GOS pilot in Fiji would aim to catalyze industry growth by bringing in flagship or anchor
clients, including from the potential primary markets of Australia and New Zealand, and assisting existing
GOS operations in the country to expand their operations. These operations could be used for practical
lessons, and for establishing the market linkages between the workforce suppliers (PICs) and customers in
near/offshore markets The overall scope of the pilot could include the creation of 1,000 direct jobs and
2,500 indirect jobs (based on an industry average of 1 direct to 2.5 indirect jobs). The cost and duration of
the pilot is estimated at $4.5 million over 1.5 years.
The traditional pilot's activities would include:
    •   Provision of additional industry specific incentives in training subsidies and tax exemption for
        pioneer companies;
    •   Identifying potential local BPO services providers (for offshoring), and setting up an industry
        association focused on GOS;
    •   Establishing a high-level industry champion within the government;
    •   Developing a short-term industry development strategy;
    •   Conducting a holistic marketing and communications program; and
    •   Providing comprehensive business development assistance for the government and the private
        sector.
The details of each activity, its budget, and timeline are shown in Table 8.1 of the main report.
The OO pilot would be aimed at practical testing of OO from various perspectives, and would help to fill
the information gaps in understanding the readiness of the workforce to meet available employment
demands. It would test the skills mix and work motivation of job seekers to do lower level tasks (for
instance, data entry, digitization, image rendering, and so on) at different levels of education and
demographics (for instance, high school graduates and female homemakers). It would also assess the
willingness and competitiveness of graduates and undergraduates to do higher-level tasks (for instance,
programming, search engine optimization, web page design, graphic design, and so on). It would also
provide insights into the long-term interest and sustainability of workers or businesses in OO, and help the
pilot's workers to win and perform actual jobs on international OO platforms.
The scope of this pilot is for activities to create 300 jobs, and the estimated cost and duration is $500,000
over one year. An intermediary/agency approach is more suitable for the OO pilot because of the range of
issues and support needed. Its role would include providing working facilities, recruiting workers from
various demographic groups, contracting with workers to formalize the labor, providing classroom and
hands-on training, enabling receipt of remuneration by workers, and conducting comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation. The details of each activity, its budget, and timeline are shown in Table 8.2 of
the main report.

Chapter 1. Introduction
The ICT for Jobs Study
The ICT revolution is transforming the Pacific region with its small island countries increasingly connected
to the global economy. Since the early 2000s, the Pacific’s telecommunications sector has undergone
deregulation and reform, and prices have been dramatically reduced. Competitive markets have led to sharp
increase in regional mobile penetration, from less than 10 percent in 2006 to more than 90 percent in several
countries in 2014, and urban centers are rapidly gaining access to 3G and 4G mobile broadband services 1.

The region's improved connectivity presents an opportunity for PICs to overcome their inherent limitations,
and help address the long-standing issue of employment and incomes. The youth bulge and the growing
youth unemployment in the region is a particularly pressing development challenge for the PICs. Hence the
consideration of ICT and other employment options is not only timely, but also necessary.

The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of leveraging ICT for jobs in the PICs. This is because
of the positive experiences that several countries, including small island economies, have had in generating
new types of employment opportunities, facilitated by ICT. The study focuses specifically on the IT-
enabled global outsourcing services industry, since ICT covers diverse subsectors. This global outsourcing
services industry is also commonly referred to as nearshoring and offshoring; and is generally for services
in IT, business processes, and knowledge processes. International experience has demonstrated that the
industry can bring significant employment to developing countries – such as India with 3.1 million direct
jobs, or Mauritius with 18,000 direct jobs. The industry also brings significant job potential for young
people and women. For instance, in India, young people aged 26-35 account for 70 percent of these jobs,
and in the Philippines women constituted nearly 60 percent of the 900,000 people employed in the industry
in 2013 (Tholons 2014).

The study analyzes the job creation prospects in this area for Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (hereafter referred to
as the "three countries") as a first phase in a broader review of the Pacific. These three countries were
chosen because of recent improvements in connectivity, particularly near-universal access to mobile
services in Fiji and Tonga, and prospective widespread availability of high-speed Internet in Samoa.

The study also draws upon global experience, including from India, the Philippines and small island
economies such as Mauritius, and other relevant literature. As discussed in the World Bank's 2014
publication on Well-being from Work in the PICs:
[S]takeholders' expectations about the region's trajectory of development (and job creation) will need to
be realistic. Due to inherent geographic obstacles (for example, remoteness, small country size, dispersion)
and small populations, PICs are unlikely to experience export-driven development and associated
employment creation on the scale seen in the broader East Asia Pacific region".
This study notes and agrees that the same level of realism should be applied to any global outsourcing
services industry development initiative in the Pacific. Hence its focus is on GOS as a new and
complementary approach to job creation in the region, and is not meant to supplement or replace existing
job creation approaches.

The study's analysis uses a common framework that is derived from the methodology of various leading
consulting firms in global outsourcing services, which covers the dimensions of:

    • Quality and quantity of talents;
    • Competitive cost;
    • Relevant infrastructure; and

    • Enabling environment.
Based on the study's findings and conclusions, this report presents recommendations and action plans for
the selected Pacific island governments to take the next step in exploring the potential of this industry.

Background
The Pacific island countries (PICs) comprise 25 nations and territories and are spread over more than 25,000
islands across the western and central Pacific Ocean. It is home to 20 out of the 51 Small Island Developing
States (SIDS) that are recognized by the United Nations.

Agriculture (including forestry and fishing), foreign aid, remittances, and tourism remain for most countries
the main source of livelihood. The tourism sector has experienced substantial growth over the past decade.
In Fiji, for example, one in three people are directly or indirectly employed in the tourism sector, which
accounts for about 35 percent of GDP (Panapasa 2013). There have been few successes in agriculture, and
fish exports and sale of fishing licenses have been unable to produce significant earnings (Hezel 2012).
With the exception of Fiji, PICs also receive some of the highest levels of foreign development aid in the
world relative to the size of their economies. On average, official development assistance (ODA) accounted
for over 25 percent of recipient GDP in PICs (Feeny et al 2014). Remittances are also a particularly
important source of income for Pacific households, which, for example, accounted for nearly one-quarter
of the countries' GDP in Samoa and Fiji (ILO 2014).

PICs possess unique vulnerabilities that make addressing poverty and development challenges more
difficult and complex. These include geographical remoteness from major global markets, small country
size, limited natural and human resources, cultural and ethnic diversity, aid dependency, and vulnerability
to climate change and natural disasters. These vulnerabilities have also hindered the region‘s progress
towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which has been slow and uneven. After Sub-Saharan
Africa, the Pacific is estimated to be the furthest away from achieving the MDGs (ILO 2014).

Further, a growing population, rapidly accelerating urbanization, and increasing monetization of economies
is making employment creation a pressing priority, particularly for young people (World Bank 2014).
Across the region, people under the age of 24 account for about 56 percent of the population of most Pacific
island countries, and the youth (15 to 24) account for a third of the working age population (15 to 59 years)
(UN System Task Team 2012). However, the stagnating economies have been unable to absorb new labor
force entrants at a pace sufficient to prevent the spread of unemployment and underemployment. An
estimated 23 percent of the potential youth labor force is unemployed, reflecting only the formal sector and
omitting those in casual, low-paid or subsistence occupations (Wilson 2012). In some countries
unemployment is estimated to be up to 58 percent (World Bank 2014).

Economic opportunities for women also remain limited in many of the PICs. Statistics suggest that, in most
Pacific countries, there are twice as many men as women in paid employment in the nonagricultural sector
Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 2011). Most women also occupy lower level positions in the public sector,
which is usually the largest employer. In the Pacific, many women work in the informal sector as they are
expected to engage in income-generating activities to support the family, but are frequently home-based
focusing on subsistence agriculture, marketing of agricultural products, and petty trading. They also often
have greater difficulty in accessing finance to grow their business, and the justice system for resolving
commercial disputes (IFC 2010).

Several countries have tried to develop a more export-oriented approach in order to foster businesses that
could create revenue and jobs but with little impact (ILO 2014). Studies suggest that policies aimed at
fostering the emergence of an export-oriented private sector, like that experienced in East Asia, are unlikely
to be effective in generating substantial jobs, except for the export of natural resources. This is largely

because of the inherent geographic obstacles of PICs resulting in high costs of production and trading and
hence lower price competitiveness of exports World Bank 2014).

Policy makers are increasingly pressed to think of innovative ways to address the growth and jobs
challenges within the formidable constraints, and at the same time reduce the country’s brain drain by
creating incentives for youth to invest their skills in their home countries. The World Bank (2014)
suggested that it is vital to increase international labor mobility to expand Pacific islanders’ access to larger
labor markets where employment opportunities are concentrated (for example, in Australia and New
Zealand) (World Bank 2014). However, this will require changes in the immigration policies of receiving
economies, and while it may lead to more stable livelihoods and greater remittances, there are also effects
of the “brain drain” of skilled workers to consider. Training skilled workers is vital to strengthen the public
sector as well as to build a vibrant private sector, and foster local entrepreneurship.

Chapter 2. The Global Outsourcing Services Industry
ICT and Global Outsourcing Services
The global ICT sector accounts for a significant share of total employment, employing almost 15 million
people in OECD countries in 2009, and millions more around the world. These include ICT jobs for
specialists who produce ICT, and ICT-intensive users who consume ICT (World Bank 2013). The OECD
classifies these roles in the following way:

    •   ICT specialists, who have the ability to develop, operate, and maintain ICT systems. ICTs
        constitutes the main part of their job;
    •   Advanced users, who are competent users of advanced, and often sector-specific, software tools.
        ICTs are not their main job but a tool; and
    •   Basic users, who are competent users of generic tools needed for the information society, e-
        government and working life (OECD 2012). This includes those working in the IT-enabled global
        outsourcing services industry.

This study focuses on ICT specialist and ICT intensive users who provide services under the IT-enabled
global outsourcing services industry, rather than on telecommunications or the IT hardware and software
subsectors. This is because international experience suggests that the global outsourcing services industry
offers significantly greater potential for job creation for PICs. The telecommunications subsector has
already created a large number of jobs in the PICs – the telecommunications revolution is estimated to have
created livelihoods for at least 30,000 people in Papua New Guinea alone – those who sell airtime for
Digicel.2 The benefits have reached countries including Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu,
and are now stretching into the North Pacific. On the other hand, the IT subsector comprises large segments
in hardware and packaged software that are dominated by established global players, such as Dell, Lenovo,
Cisco, Huawei, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. The structural requirements for participating in these
subsectors are also not viable for the PICs because of their inherent challenges in terms of small size and
geographic remoteness. Fiji, for example, has only 258 direct jobs in software and IT consulting compared
with 2, 358 direct jobs in its telecommunications industry 3.

Definition and Segmentation of Global Outsourcing Services
Advances in information technology (IT) and Internet connectivity have given impetus to a new dimension
of globalization over the past two decades: the cross-border trade in services outsourcing. This global
outsourcing services (GOS) phenomena refers to the production strategy in which a business seeks to find
the most cost efficient location for delivery of services for their internal operations and/or external clients,
even if the service is produced in a foreign country (in other words, the work can be done on behalf of a
company outside of the country where the company is located). Numerous other terms have been used to
describe all or some of these activities. This study defines global outsourcing services to include IT and IT-
enabled services (IT/ITES), IT-business process outsourcing (IT-BPO), and IT, business process,
knowledge process outsourcing (ITO/BPO/KPO). More recently, GOS has been referred to as IT and
business process management (IT-BPM) by leading countries such as India and Philippines, in order to
create the identity of being a full-service value provider rather than an industry that plays only in the lower-
end of the services spectrum. 4

Outsourcing generally refers to the subcontracting of a process, such as product design or manufacturing,
to another company – called a third-party service provider. Outsourcing may occur within or outside a
country (Bardhan et al 2013). For GOS, the typical services outsourced are IT, business processes, and

knowledge process; and the traditional approaches for GOS outsourcing have been onshoring, nearshoring
and offshoring. Table 2.1 describes each approach and their characteristics.

The GOS industry also consists of diverse types of services, and Table 2.2 provides definition and examples

and are labor-intensive (semi-skilled) in nature. However, such outsourcing is also increasing taking place
in higher end activities, referred to above as KPO.

GOS Market Statistics and Trends
Estimates of the market size for the global outsourcing services industry vary. Most estimates are in the
range of hundreds of billions U.S. dollars per year. According to KPMG, the total market size was estimated
at $952 billion per year in 2013, with ITO's share at $648 billion and BPO's at $304 billion (see Figure 2.1).
Of this total market estimate, the size of the international, cross-border GOS trade between countries
(nearshoring and offshoring) was estimated at up to $140 billion per year in 2013 (see Figure 2.2). This
international market is more relevant for the PICs and for the purposes of this study since it excludes the
sizeable domestic market within a country (that is, onshoring). The industry is growing significantly and is
expected grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7 percent for ITO and 6.0 percent for
BPO to 2017 (KPMG 2013).

India continues to lead as the global outsourcing services destination, and a number of other countries are
becoming more established in niche services areas. India is ranked first again in A.T. Kearney’s Global
Service Location Index (2014); while China, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines
have also positioned themselves as top-tier destinations. Egypt (10th), leads the Middle East and North
Africa region providing services to European nations, and has actively promoted itself as a low-cost
destination for call centers, thanks to competitive costs, a large talent pool, good universities, and proximity
to Europe. The EDUEgypt program, 5 which is being implemented under a public-private partnership (PPP)
model, has been effective in developing local skills. The program aims to prepare Egyptian graduates for
the local and global market, and since its start in 2008, the program has expanded to 10 universities
providing training to more than 10,000 students. In the case of Mexico, the development of a skilled talent
pool has been one of the critical success factors in developing the industry (see Box 2.1). Bangladesh is a
new entrant that debuted at 26th in 2014, with the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information
Services (BASIS) actively working to support the industry. In 2013, the outsourcing sector generated nearly
$100 million in exports, with growth of close to 60 percent compared to the previous year. 6
                         Box 2.1. Human Capital Development for IT/ITES: the Case of Mexico.

          Mexico has implemented targeted efforts to become a regional leader, mainly serving clients in North
          America, and has steadily improved its ranking from 11th in 2009 to 4th in 2014 in A.T. Kearney’s GSLI.
          With its abundant skilled and English speaking labor force, it presents a range of capabilities across the
          country, including IT services (Guadalajara – Mexico’s Silicon Valley, Monterrey), BPO (Mexico City,
          Ciudad Juarez), and aerospace (Santiago de Queretaro). It has also implemented targeted skills
          development efforts, including the MexicoFirst program, which in partnership with the private sector seeks
          to increase talent readiness and job linkages in the IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) industry MexicoFirst
          was created in 2008 as part of the Mexico IT Development Project financed by the World Bank, and has
          been acting as the bridge between universities and the IT industry. It has helped design training programs
          based on identified skills gaps and has negotiated with IT certification providers (for example, Oracle,
          Cisco, Microsoft, and so on) in order to provide certification at more affordable rates. Since its launch,
          more than 65,000 high-level certifications have been issued and the program is recognized as one of the
          most innovative best practices for developing a critical pool of trained personnel for growing the local IT
          industry.

Some small island economies are also competitive and benefitting from this global industry. Mauritius
(36th) and Jamaica (45th) are recognized among the offshoring leaders in their respective regions. Box 2.2
describes the success Mauritius has had in the burgeoning offshoring market. Jamaica, on the other hand,
is an offshoring leader in the Caribbean region, and has recently embarked on a path to move up the value
chain from traditional offshoring functions (for example, call centers) to creating a unique brand identity
as a global hub for digital animation, an industry that is estimated to have a shortage of about 30,000 people
worldwide. The “Youth Employment in Digital Animation Industries” project was signed between the
Government of Jamaica and the World Bank in September 2014 and aims to benefit 15,000 young
Jamaicans by 2020. 7
                       Box 2.2. ITES Offshoring in Small Island Economies: Mauritius’ Miracle.

         The ITES offshoring industry has become a stepping-stone for smaller countries to leapfrog into the global
         economy. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius, a small African island Commonwealth country with a
         population of about 1.4 million, rapidly grew from a low-income, agricultural-based economy to a middle-
         income diversified economy led by the development of a strong IT/ITES industry. In 2013 the ITES sector
         accounted for nearly seven percent of Mauritius's GDP and employed nearly 18,000 people. It is estimated
         that about 600 ICT companies currently operate in Mauritius, covering activities including software
         development, call centers, business process outsourcing (BPO), IT-enabled services (ITES), and other
         support services. Given Mauritius’ ability to service both French- and English-speaking export markets,
         BPO has become a particularly strong segment of the ICT sector with more than 330 companies active.
         Financial services and high-end BPO solutions for airlines are examples of specialized companies operating
         in the country (The Commonwealth 2011). Mauritius currently ranks 36th in the 2014 A.T. Kearney’s Global
         Service Location Index (GSLI), and is supported by two ICT industry associations, namely the Mauritius
         IT Industry Association (MITIA) and the Outsourcing and Telecommunications Association of Mauritius
         (OTAM).

         The transformation was led by strong government leadership. In the early 2000s, the Government of
         Mauritius embarked on a strategy to make the ICT/ITES sector a major pillar of the country’s economy,
         which included the implementation of targeted infrastructure and human capital development, and legal and
         regulatory reforms (for example, tax reforms) involving a mix of government and private sector players. For
         instance, the government understood that the sustained growth of the IT/ITES sector would rely heavily on
         the provision of high-bandwidth connections. In 2002, Mauritius became connected for the first time to a
         submarine fiber-optic cable route linking Europe to Asia via South Africa. Subsequently, the
         telecommunications sector became fully liberalized in January 2003, which laid the foundation for a
         competitive fixed and mobile market (Oulun et al 2012). Further, the first Technology Park (“Cyber City”)
         project was launched in 2003 under a partnership with the Government of India, which played a pivotal role
         in placing Mauritius on the map as a regional business hub. It is recognized that foreign direct investment
         (FDI) and technology transfer via multinational companies (MNCs) have played a significant role in
         developing local IT/ITES skills. A government supported “Universal ICT Education Programme” was also
         launched in 2006, with the aim of imparting computer proficiency skills to students and workers. Finally,
         the government has enhanced the regulatory framework to comply with international best practices by
         introducing various pieces of legislation, such as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act, the ICT Act,
         the Electronic Transactions Act, and so forth (Oolun et al 2012). Mauritius currently ranks 20th out of 189
         countries, and first in Africa, in the World Bank‘s Doing Business Report 2014 (World Bank Group 2014).

         Nonetheless, Mauritius’ IT/ITES sector is not without its challenges, with a shortage of a skilled labor pool
         recognized as a critical impediment for Mauritius to become a high-income knowledge-based economy –
         so called “Intelligent Mauritius” – as set forth in the National Broadband Policy 2020, and in line with the
         National ICT Strategic Plan 2011-2014 (Oolun et al 2012). As Mauritius aims to move up the value chain
         to higher end IT/KPO services, ramping up qualified human capital to meet global industry demands would
         become increasingly important. One of the principal initiatives undertaken thus far by the government has
         been the establishment of an ICT academy, which aimed to train 10,000 workers by 2014, under a public-
         private partnership (PPP) model, and provide training in internationally recognized IT/BPO skills (for
         example, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and BCI). However, according to reports, these ambitious goals have not
         yet been achieved, because of a funding shortfall for the academy in its initial stages. 8 The academy was
         officially relaunched in September 2014, and is expected to help in capacity building and to provide support
         in producing a skilled workforce capable of feeding the growing ICT/BPO sector in Mauritius.

Both are BPO focused operations (including in-bound voice and nonvoice based services, but excluding
ITO and KPO), and are sited in the Kalabu Tax Free Zone operated and administered by the Fiji Trade and
Investment Bureau (Investment Fiji). ANZ Pacific currently employs an estimated 400 workers, while
Mindpearl has 660 workers.

Fiji also won the European Outsourcing Association‘s Offshoring Destination of the Year Award in 2014
(Lewis 2014), which rewards and celebrates excellence and best practice in the outsourcing world,
acknowledging destinations and operators that have most successfully serviced the UK and other European
outsourcing markets.

In the meantime, established global outsourcing services locations such as India and the Philippines are
shifting from BPO to Business Process Management (BPM). The value chain for back-office business
services has evolved dramatically over the past two decades and many of the top players including India
and the Philippines have started to provide higher value added end-to-end solutions to customers. In the
coming years, robotic process automation (RPA) could have revolutionary consequences for industry
rationalization and labor markets, allowing robots and smart machines to take over the jobs of traditional
BPO employees.

Chapter 3. Traditional and Online Outsourcing Approaches
Online Outsourcing Definition, Market Size, and Segmentation
Online outsourcing (OO) is a new GOS industry approach that has emerged in recent years, owing to
continual advances in technology and connectivity (A.T. Kearney 2014). OO refers to the performance of
tasks conducted over the Internet by workers from anywhere in the world, using online marketplaces or
exchanges. 10 These online marketplaces provide clients with access to a global labor pool of workers, and
provide a platform on which workers can perform and deliver their work. Workers are financially
remunerated for their work. Online outsourcing encompasses two major sectors:

•   Microwork, where projects and tasks are broken down into microtasks that can be completed in seconds
    or minutes. Microworkers require basic numeracy and literacy skills; examples of microtasks include
    image tagging, text transcription, and data entry. Workers are paid small amounts of money for each
    completed task, and barriers to entry are lower than those of online freelancing, making it particularly
    attractive to unemployed and underemployed individuals with no specialized skills.

•   Online freelancing (also known as e-lancing), where clients contract professional services to distributed
    third party-workers. Online freelancing often requires a higher level of expertise than microwork, with
    workers possessing technical or professional skills. Online freelancing tasks tend to be larger projects
    that are performed over longer durations of time – hours, days, or months. Examples include graphic
    design, web development, or technical report writing. Financial remuneration tends to be higher for
    online freelancers than microworkers.

The market size for OO was estimated at about $2 billion in 2013, which is a fraction of the total GOS
market based on the estimates in the previous chapter. Currently the online freelancing market is over ten
times larger than the microwork market. There are already numerous OO marketplaces in the global market
(see Figure 3.1). Industry experts suggest that the top three platforms (Elance-oDesk, Freelancer.com and
Zhubajie/Witmart) form about 50 percent of the market. Of these, Elance-oDesk is the clear market leader,
with $750 million of combined revenue in 2013.
                           Figure 3.1. Examples of Online Outsourcing Marketplaces.




The global OO industry is highly diverse and evolving, and one feasible approach to segment the industry
is by the complexity level of the tasks. Figure 3.2 illustrates some common job categories and their
breakdown by complexity.

Comparing Different Approaches
The global market size of OO is currently dwarfed by the size of the market for traditional GOS approaches
(onshoring, nearshoring, and offshoring). However, OO offers new benefits and value for global
outsourcing services players. For clients, OO provides broader access to specialized skills, more flexible
and faster hiring processes and 24-hour productivity. For workers, it creates access to global job markets.
For developing countries, OO represents a unique and new opportunity to provide employment and incomes
for masses of youth and women.

In particular, OO is highly unique and innovative for PICs, as it enables these countries to completely
transcend their inherent challenges of size and geography. OO is also less structured and more informal
than the traditional offshoring and nearshoring approaches. For example, it does not require as high a level
of infrastructure or enabling environment, and the workforce consists of online contractors rather than
formal employees. OO’s impact could also have more development depth, as it could be more pro-poor and
pro-women than traditional GOS approaches.

Chapter 4. Job Implications for PICs
GOS and Jobs
The global outsourcing services industry is potentially a viable channel for creation of additional jobs and
income in the PICs. The GOS industry's growth has led to increasing demand for skilled workers globally.
Availability of skilled manpower remains a binding constraint, and provides an opportunity for developing
countries’ leverage for job and income creation. Even a country like India, which has access to a large
English-speaking talent pool, is facing a shortage of skilled manpower. India, for example, is facing a
shortage of “right talents” in their GOS industry in spite of having 12 million employable people injected
into their labor market every year (businessstandard.com 2014). Other developing countries that can quickly
ramp up the availability of their talent pool can potentially benefit from this increased demand.

The GOS industry in India alone has created 3.1 direct million jobs. 11 Further, every direct job created in
this industry is estimated to create indirect employment for about 2.5 people in other sectors. Notably, India,
the Philippines, South Africa, Mauritius, and Egypt, have been successful in creating GOS employment.
India’s case shows that 70 percent of jobs are taken by young people aged 26-35 (Tholons 2014). In the
Philippines, employment in the industry exceeded 900,000 FTE in 2013, where women constitute nearly
60 percent of the workforce. 12

Sources (World Bank 2015b) indicate that that there are were about 48 million workers in 2013 globally
registered on online working platforms, and about 10 percent (4.8 million in total) are actively completing
tasks. Of this, just over 10 percent of workers are registered with microwork platforms while the vast
majority are on online freelancing platforms. There is no clear market leader in terms of the number of
registered workers. Freelancer.com is the largest platform and currently reports over 15 million registered
users, Zhubajie/Witmart reports over 11 million registered workers, and Elance-oDesk reports almost 10

populations engaged in online outsourcing. With reference to Table 5 below, smaller countries can also

The new OO approach for GOS, though relatively small at this stage of development, is a particularly
promising area for digital earning opportunities by young people and women in PICs. This channel is highly
innovative for job creation in the Pacific because it completely transcends the PICs’ inherent and long-
standing challenges of geographic remoteness, small size, isolation, and insufficiency of physical
infrastructure. There is an opportunity for Pacific youth and women to work anywhere, anytime from their
locality, and participate as part of the 4.8 million active global OO workers in the growing global digital
economy.

Creating employment in the GOS industry could also bring about other socioeconomic benefits for PICs.
International experience suggests that the development of a vibrant local GOS industry also generates
positive spillovers to other sectors of the economy by facilitating knowledge and technology transfer and
fostering local innovation. Experience also suggests that it drives positive social change for women. The
global outsourcing industry is gender-biased towards women, as disproportionately more women are hired
than in other industries. 13 Women report in focus groups and structured interviews that in some countries
online outsourcing is a positive contributor towards gender equity because it is more compatible with
cultural and social norms than traditional employment (World Bank 2015b). For example, Indian women
use online work as a way of earning income while caring for children and elderly family members, and
Egyptian women from traditional Islamic households use online freelancing as an alternative to working in
male-dominated workplaces.

However the job creation implication of the GOS industry will also have to be considered in the broader
development context of the region. As mentioned above, and supported by the World Bank's report on Well-
being from Work in the PICs, "while business environment reforms can open up new opportunities for
private sector development and employment creation, such measures are unlikely to spur sufficient work to
meet emerging demands even in the best possible business environment."

Estimates of Jobs and Other Impacts for PICs
Quantitative estimates of the impact that the global outsourcing services industry may have on a country is
helpful in providing a better understanding of its potential and informs decision making in industry
development initiatives. However, estimates will have to be based on several arbitrary assumptions because
there is limited information on the industry available from most countries. Moreover, there is a lack of
industry information from the three countries because it is a relatively new or completely unexplored
industry. There is also an assumption of active government intervention in the industry. As international
experience illustrates, it is not expected that the industry will grow organically without a deliberate effort
by the three countries. In addition it would be useful to have optimistic and conservative estimates of
industry outcomes. The optimistic case could assume that three countries achieve similar averages in terms
of jobs and revenue per worker as the most successful GOS countries; the conservative case could be based

A simple estimate is provided in this report to present the possible employment impact that the GOS
industry may have on the three countries. Subsequent programs to develop the industry could develop a
more sophisticated model for industry planning and strategic purposes. Table 4.4 presents the data for
selected GOS players and calculations for:

    •       the number of direct jobs as percentage of population size,
    •       the average revenue per worker, and
    •       the industry's percentage contribution to the country's GDP.

It also provides the averages for these three calculations, which is used for the optimistic case estimate, and
a discounted one-third of these averages for the conservative case estimate.

Table 4.5 shows the optimistic case estimates in five years’ time for each of the three countries in terms of:

    •       direct, indirect and total jobs,
    •       average revenue per worker,
    •       estimated total industry revenue, and
    •       industry's percentage contribution to the country's GDP.

These calculations are based on the average figures derived in Table 4.4, with the optimistic assumption
that the three countries would be able to achieve the same level of success as the most successful GOS
countries in the world today.

In this optimistic scenario, estimates indicate that the direct jobs potential is highly significant. In Fiji for
example, the GOS industry could create 5,809 direct jobs over the next five years. This is more than five
times the current number of GOS jobs (1,060 combined for ANZ Pacific Operations and Mindpearl), and


                                                                        20

translates to almost 2.5 times more direct jobs than the country's telecommunications industry. 14 In addition,
it could contribute up to 3.39 percent of Fiji's GDP.

In contrast, Table 4.6 shows the conservative case estimates for each of the three countries for these same
factors. In this case the calculations are based on one-third of the average numbers derived in Table 4.4.
This highly conservative estimate assumes the limitations of private sector development for the three
countries are also applicable to the GOS industry, in addition to being late industry entrants.

In this conservative case, estimates indicate that the direct jobs potential remains notable, as it is larger than
some of the established industries in the countries. For Fiji for example, the GOS industry would add about
an estimated 900 more jobs only. Nevertheless, that translates to more direct formal and "paid employment"
than the combined total of the country's agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector (1,936 compared to 1,604)
(Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics 2007).

Chapter 5. Methodology
Research
Research for this study was based on primary and secondary data collected through desk research, field
interviews, and discussions covering Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Interviews were conducted with government,
private sector, and IT industry representatives across the three countries. The study team also conducted
group interviews with undergraduate students in the University of South Pacific's (USP) campuses in Fiji
and Tonga.

The study references relevant analytical work for regional-level data to the extent possible, as official
statistics were found to be sparse and offering an incomplete picture of employment and work in the three
countries. In particular, the study drew upon information and findings from the World Bank‘s 2014 working
paper, Well-being from Work in the Pacific Island Countries because of its direct relevance to this study.

Analytical Approach and Framework
The global outsourcing services industry is mature and has been examined thoroughly across time and
geographies. Various consulting firms, including A.T. Kearney, Gartner, and McKinsey, have already
identified the numerous criteria for competitiveness and success, and have developed benchmarking
frameworks, locational indices, and rating criteria for determining the e-readiness and attractiveness of
different locations. Table 5.1 provides a detailed list of numerous factors affecting a country's attractiveness.

While different factors and categories are used in each model, the common four key dimensions
determining a country‘s “locational competitiveness” are:

    •     quality and quantity of talent,
    •     competitive costs,
    •     quality of relevant public infrastructure, and
    •     enabling environment.

Figure 5.1 illustrates these dimensions and their contribution to country competitiveness.

The factors affecting locational attractiveness are described in more detail below:

Quantity and quality of talent: Together with the existence of competitive telecommunication markets,
especially for broadband services, the availability of employee skills is the single most important factor in
the growth of the global outsourcing industry. This includes a number of aspects, such as suitability for
employment – that is, meeting a quality standard for work in the industry and having the necessary language
(not necessarily English) skills – and willingness to work in the industry, a function of both the stature of
the industry and the availability of other job options.

Competitive costs: Primary cost considerations, from the point of view of a company making an investment
decision, include: the cost of labor (from entry-level employees to seasoned managers); infrastructure costs;
selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A); and facilities costs. For nearshoring types in
particular, the evaluation of cost would also reflect fiscal or other incentives provided by the government
to encourage investment, corporate tax rates, and special incentives and tax holidays.

Access to relevant infrastructure: Considerations include the availability, quality, and reliability of services
such as telecommunications (including broadband), power, and transportation, along with availability of
suitable real estate (for ITO/BPO/KPO). In countries with unreliable public infrastructure, companies look
for the ability to self-provide services or alternatively for customized facilities such as IT parks—with
modern office space, high-speed broadband links, reliable power supply (including backup supply), security
services, and ancillary infrastructure including banks, travel desks, restaurants, transportation systems, and
hotel accommodation for visiting executives. They also look for availability of land and business-friendly
procedures such as quick building clearances for real estate development. The availability of good flight
connections to clients and markets is also an important factor.

Enabling environment: The general business environment of a country – government support for ICT or
GOS industries, and policies toward foreign direct investment, ease of doing business, GOS industry
maturity, and so on – is also an important factor in a company’s decision about where to invest. Country
risk relates to stability and transparency of law, macroeconomic stability, treatment of foreign capital, and
data and intellectual property law protection, to name but a few.

These four dimensions form a common unified framework for assessment, which has been used by the
World Bank for numerous country assessments. The framework is designed in particular for assessing the
traditional global outsourcing services industry, because of its stringent and highly structured requirements.
However the framework could also be used for OO, which is an informal and less structured approach to
GOS. Hence certain factors are not as important for OO as they are for ITO/BPO/KPO, such as the
availability of government tax incentives, Internet redundancy and power, physical infrastructure such as
Class A office spaces, flight connectivity, and so on.

Chapter 6. SWOT Analysis
General Description
The analysis uses the Strengths-Weakness-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) tool to assess the
competitiveness of the PICs in global outsourcing. Hence the study examines the strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities and threats, based on the analytical framework and its four factors determining locational
attractiveness. The assessment is also based on quantitative comparisons to the extent possible, and limits
attempts to quantify qualitative factors, such as the willingness to work. These qualitative factors could be
better examined in the next steps of industry development proposals.

The focus of the analysis is on the three countries. It also refers to the PICs when there is regional data that
is applicable also to the three countries. The analysis is also from the "supply" oriented perspective of the
PICs, instead of the "demand" oriented perspective of potential GOS clients, since its purpose is to inform
government officials and development practitioners interested in GOS industry development for job
creation.

The analysis uses information from, and makes comparisons with, various countries to assess general
competitiveness from a global perspective. In particular, it includes India and Philippines, as these countries
provide global industry benchmark and have higher availability of industry-related data. The comparisons
with these significantly larger countries does not imply that they are the main competitor countries to the
PICs but reflect the industry's global nature as the competition could be from any country in the world. For
example, a BPO worker is unlikely to be able to receive more than $2 per hour for basic tasks, such as data
entry, regardless of whether they are working from larger countries, like India or China, or from small
countries, like Malta or Mauritius. The new OO paradigm has also made it completely irrelevant which
country a worker (or competitor) is from, as it is global competition that matters.

Quality and Quantity of Talent
Strengths

Advanced English skills: The PICs have a general regional advantage of relatively high English language
skills, and this is pertinent since most BPO and OO work is conducted in English. English is one of the
official languages in each of the three countries and remains widely used in government, business, and
education as a lingua franca. Pacific countries like Fiji also have the advantage of a relatively neutral accent
for voice-based operations, such as call centers 15.

High literacy and education rates: The three countries also benefit from high literacy rates of 99 to 100
percent and high secondary and tertiary education rates (World Bank 2014). Available statistics show that,
in 2011, net enrollment in secondary education reached 83 percent and 80 percent in Fiji and Samoa,
respectively. In Tonga, a total of 14,874 students were enrolled in secondary education in 2011. 16 Statistics
also shows that there were 1,670 tertiary graduates in Fiji in 2004, and 3,830 in Samoa in 2011. 17

The population in the three countries also appears to be comparatively computer literate compared to their
peers in other outsourcing countries. The percentage using the Internet in Fiji (37.1 percent), Tonga (35
percent), and Samoa (15.3 percent) are competitive with India (15.1 percent) and Philippines (37 percent),
which are the largest outsourcing countries in the world (see Figure 6.1).

However, the study notes that, because of data constraints, it is more difficult to report the quality of
secondary and tertiary education, and even more so to understand the relevance of the skills mix of
secondary and tertiary graduates to employers’ needs.

Relatively high level of Facebook usage: There is also a comparable level of Facebook users in the three
countries, compared with India and Philippines (see Figure 6.2). Facebook penetration rates are highly
relevant for OO in particular, as some international firms use it as a quick gauge of the population’s ability
to engage in OO. Their global experience suggests that individuals who can use Facebook should also be
able to conduct basic online tasks, such as data entry and digitization. For instance, in Fiji, Facebook users
have reached 280,000 people accounting for over 30 percent of the total population. Facebook penetrations
in Tonga and Samoa are also relatively high at 24.5 percent and 18.5 percent of the total population. 18
Though the user base is small due to the small population size, these penetration rates are comparable to
countries including Mauritius (33.5 percent) and Poland (27.6 percent), which are strong IT-enabled
services locations, and significantly higher than emerging countries including Moldova (10.4 percent) and
Ghana (8.9 percent).

Most suitable population demographics: The PICs benefit generally from demographic characteristics that
position it well from the youth and gender perspectives. International experience shows that young people
are the main demographic group performing outsourcing in the world. The PICs face a youth bulge as 54
percent of the population is below the age of 24, a higher proportion than all developing countries, and the
world (World Bank 2014). The relatively high percentage of females in universities in the three countries,
and the relatively low rate of women‘s participation in formal employment in the PICs (World Bank 2014) 19
present a pool of talent that could be tapped for outsourcing work.

Weaknesses

Limited scalability of human resources and limited talent for ITO services: The size of the three countries’
potential labor force limits its ability to support large-scale operations, or for new operations to scale to
significant sizes. The potential size of the labor force for outsourcing is dwarfed significantly by global
competitor countries with larger populations, such as Egypt, India, and Nigeria. The combined total
population of the three countries is less than the outsourcing workforce of India, which stood at 3.1 million
in 2014. The limited human resource supply is far from adequate for attracting and sustaining large
outsourcing operations and will probably be limited to operations considered to be in the small (less than
$10 million revenue) or emerging ($10 to 100 million revenue) size categories. 20 In addition, the number
of talented people available for ITO work, such as coding and software development, is constrained because
of the limited quantity and quality of graduates in such disciplines.

Understanding of young people’ skills requirements: There is insufficient understanding in the three
countries about the skills young people need for global service work, especially in Samoa and Tonga.
Except for Fiji, the experience and track record of GOS work in these countries is limited, and interviews
with current youth employers in the IT industry brought conflicting responses. The youth also have
relatively weak soft skills, especially in areas such as marketing and customer service. However, it is
recognized that most young people in developing countries generally lack these soft skills. Such skills are
also more important for workers in the traditional GOS industry segments, but are less relevant for OO as
less interaction and teamwork is required.

Opportunities

High proportion of youth available: There is an underlying human resource opportunity for global
outsourcing both from a full- and part-time perspective. This is because the three countries possess the
highest youth demographics in the world, experience persistent unemployment and underemployment, and
currently offer limited formal employment options for the educated youth and women in particular (World
Bank 2014).

Pacific diaspora: Better utilization of the Pacific diaspora could help alleviate the shortage of skilled
workers in the short term. It was estimated that, by 2010, about 850,000 people of Pacific island ancestry
or ethnicity would have been living in the four Pacific Rim recipient countries: New Zealand, Australia, the
United States, and Canada. 21 For example, the population of Tonga decreased by over 10,000 people
between 2006 and 2011, as a result of emigration.

Threats

Uncertainty about the youth's ability and willingness to work in the industry: The willingness of local
workers to take up global outsourcing services work in the longer term is uncertain because of their wage
expectations. Interviews with young people in the three countries' suggest that they have relatively high
wage expectations, and it is unclear if such expectations can be met since it depends on their ability to
provide quality output. For example, the Fijian undergraduates interviewed stated that they expected a wage
of at least FJD3.5 ($1.73) per hour, even for internships or part-time jobs. This is higher than the wage rate
in Mauritius, where a BPO worker earns an average of about $1.47 per hour for basic data entry tasks (The
Capfour Group 2012) 22. However, Mauritians have proven their skills in their mature GOS industry, but it
is not uncertain if young Fijians could deliver at the same wage rate. It is also common for students in many
developed countries to work part time while managing their studies. However, part-time work does not
appear to be as common for young people in the three countries, as the students interviewed stated that they
would only undertake such work if it did not interfere with their studies and performance in examinations.
However, the study acknowledges that a more solid evidence-based assessment through a youth survey
would be required in order to corroborate these assumptions and sample interviews.

Competitive Cost
Strengths

Minimum wage is comparable with established global outsourcing services provider countries: The three
countries official minimum wage appears to be relatively competitive from a global perspective, even for
low-level tasks such as data entry and digitization. The first minimum wage law introduced in Fiji in March
2014 set a rate of F$2.0 ($1.04) per hour. 23 Samoa's is lower at SAT2.0 (~$0.88) per hour, although that
was due to increase to SAT2.30 (~$1.01) per hour in January 2015. 24 There is no minimum wage for Tonga.
Based on these minimum wages, Fiji and Samoa are competitive with Mauritius ($1.47 per hour), and
Nepal, where an OO worker is expected to earn an estimated $1.25 per hour. 25 Minimum wages provides a
cost base for assessing a country's competitiveness. However it is noted that actual and expected wages in
each country may vary significantly from the minimum and, as mentioned above, it is not certain if workers
from Fiji and Samoa are willing to take up work at official minimum wages.

Weaknesses

High broadband costs: The cost of broadband connectivity for both traditional and online outsourcing is
not competitive in the three countries, particularly because of the data caps set by many operators, which is
a disadvantage for IT-enabled businesses that rely on a large flows of data traffic within and across borders.
The cost of a 512 kbit/s connection in Fiji may reach up to $26.73 per month, and in Samoa and Tonga a 2

Mbit/s connection is offered for a monthly price of $43.63 and $31.54, respectively, though with additional
fees for excess usage (see Table 6.1). For example, this compares unfavorably with Philippines, where
outsourcing companies can buy uncapped connection for about $22.29 (P1,000) per month for speeds of up
to 2 Mbit/s, and about $44.57 (P2,000) for speeds of up to 5 Mbit/s (Senate of the Philippines 2014).

High costs for last mile Internet: The competitiveness of last mile broadband connectivity varies across the
three countries, and generally ranges from moderately competitive to noncompetitive. For example, the
cost of fixed broadband is competitive in Fiji, as packages of up to 10 Mbit/s and a 30 GB monthly data
cap are available for F$49 (~$25) per month 26. Fiji and Tonga are connected to submarine fiber-optic cables
offering ample capacity and relatively low-cost bandwidth (wholesale). Samoa is connected to a submarine
cable that is nearing the end of its life but the wholesale price is relative high because of its unregulated
monopoly and legacy contract issues. Satellite services are used to provide redundancy but at relatively
high cost.

Opportunities

Reducing cost of Internet access: The recent improvements in international connectivity in the three
countries brings with it a high possibility that the cost of Internet access will be lowered significantly, both
for businesses and individuals conducting outsourcing. This is concrete progress that the countries could
use to market themselves, and to improve their outsourcing competitiveness in the medium to long term.

Threats

Unrealized benefits of new connectivity for end users: There is a risk that these foreseen improvements in
international connectivity may not translate to cost savings or improved services for businesses and
individuals involved in outsourcing. Governments in the three countries will need to ensure that the Internet
services industry carry forward the cost benefits to local GOS businesses and individuals.

Availability and Quality of Relevant Infrastructure
Strengths

Improved access to Internet: The three countries are moderately competitive in terms of availability of
Internet infrastructure for outsourcing and should be able to increase their competitiveness in the short to
medium term. Fiji stands out with over 5 Gbit/s of international bandwidth, substantially more than all of
the other countries combined (see Figure 6.3). It has been connected to undersea fiber optic cable for over
a decade and has emerged as a regional hub, landing cables from Tonga and Vanuatu. In addition, controls
imposed on international bandwidth pricing have resulted in more cost-oriented tariffs spurring demand
(World Bank 2015a).

Internet and broadband services have traditionally been readily available in the main islands and cities, and
businesses and individuals in the main cities generally have access to fixed or mobile broadband services.
The region is also increasingly linked to the global economy, particularly in urban centers. Since the mid-
2000s, the Pacific’s telecommunications sectors have undergone deregulation and reform. Competitive
markets have led to sharp increases in access to basic telecommunications throughout the region. As an
indicator of access and connectivity, mobile phone penetration in the PICs has grown from below 10 percent
in 2006 to between 60 and 95 percent in 2013, and this figure continues to climb, although there is some
way to go before it catches up with existing GOS players (see Figure 6.4).

The World Bank, with other partners, in particular the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is also supporting
a Pacific Regional Connectivity Program that aims to connect Tonga, Samoa, Palau, the Federated States
of Micronesia, and other countries as needed to global communications networks in a series of phased
investments in submarine fiber optic cables, or other appropriate regional connectivity solutions. In the first
phase, cofinanced by the World Bank and ADB, the Tonga-Fiji submarine cable went live in August 2013.
Within a few months, the number of Internet users in Tonga increased five-fold and prices fell by 60 percent.
There are now plans to extend the cable to Tonga’s outer islands. In Fiji, the proportion of Internet users
increased from 17 percent in 2009 to 37.1 percent in 2013. 27

High level of access to electricity: The three countries enjoy high levels of access to electricity relative to
other PICs. Samoa and Tonga enjoy high levels of access to power at 99 percent and 95 percent of the
population, respectively. Fiji has a slightly lower level of access at 89 percent of the population.
Nonetheless, in general, energy poverty is widespread in the PICs. It is estimated that 70 percent of Pacific
Islander households do not have access to electricity, which is equivalent to access rates in Sub-Saharan
Africa and slightly below the average for low-income countries (Dornan 2014). Further, costs of electricity
are high and volatile, particularly in Samoa and Tonga. This is because of the PICs high dependency on
energy imports, which makes electricity generation predominantly diesel-based, supplemented by
renewable energy generation, such as hydro, biofuels, solar, and wind, depending upon available and
accessible resources 28.

Ready access to computers and Internet: In the main islands and cities of the three countries the young
appear to have ready access to personal computers (PCs) and the Internet, either in their schools or homes.
For example, most undergraduate students interviewed for this study in Fiji and Tonga confirmed that they
have access to both PCs and the Internet. They can also use the network of private-sector cybercafés,
although they are typically located only in the city centers. In addition, the Fijian government has built
more than 25 telecenters across the country and they are reported to have been widely used. 29 This
infrastructure could be used as OO work centers.

Access to international micropayment mechanisms: Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa have access to at least one of
the three major international micropayment mechanisms, that is, PayPal, Payoneer and Skrill. These are the
three main payment mechanisms used by most international OO platforms to reimburse workers for jobs or
tasks completed.

Weaknesses

Quality issues with the Internet: The three countries are general weak in terms of overall quality of
connectivity infrastructure. With the exception of Fiji, broadband speed, quality, and reliability are
generally inadequate to support large-scale outsourcing operations that typically require full redundancy
and nonstop, round-the-clock availability. Interviews also suggest that the quality of last mile connectivity
can be highly unreliable. This drastically limits the countries' ability to perform microwork (under OO),
which is carried out in real time on online platforms (unlike online freelancing where the work can be
performed offline).

Limited availability of international transport and office infrastructure. There is insufficient international
transport infrastructure. For example, it may take the same or more time to travel from Sydney to Suva,
than to Manila. This is because of the lower frequency of flights and the need for transfers in between.
There is also a general lack of a dedicated and permanent IT parks in Samoa and Tonga to provide Class A
office spaces dedicated to nearshoring or offshoring. In contrast, Fiji has free trade zones in Kalabu and

Telepark that can and are being used for GOS operations, and the government has approved two temporary
facilities at USP Stratham ICT Park and ATH Technology Park. 30

Limited access to banking: Most young people in the three countries do not have access to banking services.
This is a hindrance to OO, as the international micropayment mechanisms need to be linked to a bank
account for effective payment to workers.

Opportunities

Improved connectivity opens up opportunities to participate in the GOS industry: The improved Internet
connectivity on some PICs (as discussed above) provides the opportunity for the local private sector to
participate in the GOS industry for the first time. Such opportunities did not exist previously, given that
basic connectivity is a prerequisite for participation in this industry.

Threats

Improved services are not certain: There is a threat that increased backbone connectivity may not be
translated into improved connectivity services for businesses and individuals in all three countries. This
could become a critical constraint for these countries to participate in global outsourcing services.

Environment
Strengths

Basic investment incentives are in place: Fiji has highly competitive incentives in place that are applicable
to the GOS industry (see Table 6.3). There are specific tax incentives for companies meeting basic
requirements in the ICT sector, which includes tax exemption for 13 years and duty free import of IT-
related equipment for initial establishment and ongoing operations. The country also has a dedicated
investment promotion agency, Investment Fiji, which actively promotes the country as a favorable location
for businesses and offers various incentives for ICT-related businesses. Investment promotion in Samoa
and Tonga, on the other hand, are still nascent. In July 2014, the first ever investment-profiling workshop
was held in Tonga, which aimed to educate participants on how to better package and promote investment
opportunities in Tonga to potential foreign investors. 31

Relative ease of doing business: The three countries are relatively competitive in terms of overall ease of
doing business, ranking at Samoa (67), Tonga (69), and Fiji (81), respectively out of 189 countries (see
Table 6.4). In fact, the three countries rank higher than India (142) and the Philippines (95), two of the most

successful countries in GOS (see Table 6.5). However, weaknesses remain in the three countries that require
dedicated efforts for improvement including, among other things, starting a business, protecting minority
investors, and trading across borders (Fiji), getting credit (Samoa), and registering property and protecting
minority investors (Tonga). The regulatory environment is important as it underlines the competitiveness
of the economy and whether such an environment is conducive to the operations of a business. In particular,
for small population countries, such as Mauritius (1.3 million) and Lithuania (2.96 million), the ease of
doing business is highly correlated to its attractiveness as a GOS location. This correlation could be
especially important for client companies considering nearshoring options in the three countries for the first
time. Clients companies will need to consider the local set up and operational issues that may arise from
their nearshoring operations, but there are limited experiences of GOS in the three countries to give them
confidence.

Emerging global outsourcing services industry: A small GOS industry appears to be emerging in Fiji and
Tonga, which could help to strengthen the enabling environment in terms of industry perception,
experience, and support. As discussed above, Fiji already hosts BPO operations set up by multinational
companies and won an international outsourcing award in 2014. In 2012, ICT service exports grew to
account for 4.3 percent of the Fiji‘s total service exports, compared to 2.9 percent in 2010. 32 Tonga also
opened a new call center helpdesk set up by Procomm Services in 2013. 33 The call center is technically an
onshoring, rather than offshoring operation as it serves mainly the domestic market. However such domestic
operations will improve the industry's experience and provide a usable reference for expanding their GOS
industry.

Weaknesses

Inherent challenges are still relevant for traditional and larger GOS approaches: The inherent constraints
of small countries with small populations and geographic remoteness remain a key impediment to large-


                                                                                                                                               35
                                                                                      Report No: 96218-EAP


scale nearshoring or offshoring operations in the three countries. Even in the age of globalization, 90 percent
of the trade that occurs over a distance of 1,000 kilometers would cease at a distance of 9,000 kilometers,
and the average Pacific island country is 11,456 kilometers from any other randomly selected country
weighted by rest-of-the world GDP (World Bank 2014). For traditional outsourcing, clients and PICs
service providers will still need to travel for set up of captive BPO operations, or interact for business and
operational discussions for noncaptives. Hence, the distance, time, and cost of travel will still be a
hindrance. However, these limitations are expected to have limited impact from an OO perspective, as
business discussions and actual task performance are mainly conducted virtually online.

Limited awareness as outsourcing destinations: The three countries (and PICs in general) also require
significant awareness raising as potential outsourcing destinations. There are no PICs in the list of well-
known global outsourcing destinations published by major consulting firms. 34 In addition, there are only
limited examples of GOS-related operations to establish a proven track record for outsourcing.

Opportunities

Increasing political support: Political support is growing for the use of ICT for development in the three
countries. The Government of Fiji has already recognized the importance of ICT as an enabler of economic
development and has implemented a number of favorable policies and incentives. In 2013, the Government
of Tonga requested the assistance of the Commonwealth Secretariat to develop a strategy to leverage
investment in the country's broadband for economic development (Commonwealth Secretariat 2013). The
strategy specifically identified global outsourcing services as a key industry development opportunity.

Unexplored Australian and New Zealand markets: There is a timely and unique opportunity for the three
countries to explore Australia and New Zealand as potential sources of demand for global outsourcing
services. As shown in Table 2.1, nearshoring offers the benefit of cultural similarity and ease of
management. The PICs are geographically closer to Australia and New Zealand, are located in almost
similar time zones, and have high cultural affinity and familiarity. In addition, compared to most potential
competitors from Asia or other regions, there is a positive association with Australia and New Zealand
because of the perception of the three countries as a tourist destination. Moreover, Australia's multibillion
industry already has contact centers with over 200,000 seats, of which over 20 percent are outsourced.
However, Australia’s most favored offshoring destinations have been the global industry leaders – the
Philippines because of proximity, and India because of process excellence and industry maturity (Avasant
2012).

Threats

Changing labor laws: The labor laws in the three countries could become onerous for the OO industry.
Samoa's labor laws already require part-time workers to be entitled to full-time employees’ benefits after
12 months of employment, regardless of the amount of time spent working. This is challenging for OO as
most of its global workers are part-timers. Hence, an intermediary intending to recruit, train, assist, and
contract local workers for OO jobs will also become liable for providing such benefits a year after hiring.
The labor laws for the other two countries may change in this respect too. In 2014, Fiji introduced its first
minimum wage law, and Samoa raised its minimum wage.

Cybersecurity. The three countries lack to a varying degree, specific policies, strategies, legislation, and
regulation related to cybersecurity. In Fiji, some legislation on cybercrime was enacted through the Crimes
Decree 2009: Division 6 - Computer Offences. 35 Tonga has also enacted cybercrime-related legislation in
its Computer Misuse Act 2003, Copyright Act 2005, and the Tongan Internet Corporation Registration Act
2000. 36 In Samoa, cybersecurity-related legislation is evident in the Crimes Act 2013, the
Telecommunications Act 2005, Broadcasting Act 2008, and Electronic Transactions Act 2008. 37 However,
all three countries lack legislation and a regulatory framework that is specific to cybercrime, that is, a

Chapter 7. Findings and Conclusions
Findings
The analysis found the following key competitive advantages for the three countries:

    •   Availability of a small labor pool that is young and qualified for basic voice or nonvoice BPO tasks.
        This labor pool is the youngest in the world (in terms of youth bulge and unemployment); and is
        relatively educated, has a high level of English skills, and is comparatively computer literate.
    •   Minimum wage costs are comparable to the international wage costs for basic outsourcing tasks.
    •   Availability of basic Internet infrastructure that is improving in terms of speed, quality, and cost
        owing to new and ongoing connectivity initiatives.
    •   Availability of at least one international micropayment mechanism in each country, for example,
        PayPal, Payoneer, Skrill.
    •   High level of political support for ICT initiatives resulting in connectivity improvements.
    •   Basic investment incentives are in place, but only Fiji has highly competitive ICT sector specific
        incentives.
    •   Higher ranking in ease of doing business than the leading global outsourcing services players, such
        as India and the Philippines.
    •   Emerging local global outsourcing services industry – Fiji already hosts some GOS operations, and
        in 2014 won the Offshoring Destination of the Year Award by the European Outsourcing
        Association.
    •   Ability to offer unique nearshoring services to the Australian and New Zealand markets. The
        benefits for potential clients include ease of management and operations because of proximity or
        similar time zones, relatively shorter distances than the nearest competitors, and cultural and
        business affinity.

The analysis also found the following key competitive disadvantages:

    •   The three countries’ population and labor pool is small, limiting their ability to serve large clients,
        and limiting the industry’s potential size and impact on jobs.
    •   Although minimum wage costs in the three countries are comparable with global benchmarks for
        basic BPO work, it is not highly compelling from a cost-savings perspective for potential clients,
        especially since the three countries are new industry entrants in a largely mature global market.
    •   Doubts about the youth’s ability and willingness to deliver quality on BPO tasks, while their wage
        expectations are much higher than their country's minimum wages, and are as high as those paid to
        workers in proven countries like Mauritius.
    •   Relatively high Internet costs for businesses and individuals.
    •   Highly limited awareness and virtually no experience in OO.
    •   Potential clients have limited awareness and experience of the region as outsourcing destinations.

These findings also may be viewed from various industry-specific dimensions:

By the three countries

    •   Fiji is significantly more ready than Samoa or Tonga for GOS industry development. The country
        has higher quantity and quality of skills, better telecommunication and physical infrastructure, a
        minimum wage that is still competitive, and regional and international companies already doing
        offshoring. Fiji also appears ready to take the lead, as it is positioning itself as the knowledge hub
        for the region.

By ITO/BPO/KPO subsectors

   •   BPO is much more feasible for the three countries in the immediate to short term. The general skills
       level appears sufficient and competitive for basic, voice and nonvoice-based jobs, such as
       helpdesks, data entry, or digitization. Minimum wages in Fiji and Samoa are also comparable to
       global BPO wage benchmarks. In addition, Fiji already has experience of voice-based services that
       could be used as offshoring references.
   •   It may not be feasible to compete in ITO for now, as there does not appear to be a sufficient quantity
       and quality of talented people available for this market segment. In addition, undergraduates’
       expectations of wages are equal to those of proven locations like Mauritius, but it is not clear if
       they could deliver their work competitively.
   •   KPO is unlikely to be feasible in the short to medium term because of the much higher level of
       skills and service provider maturity and sophistication required.

By Task Segments

   •   The three countries do not appear to have obvious or particular areas of strengths or specialization
       for niche offerings, such as graphic design or accounting services. For example, Sri Lanka focused
       on accounting services in their initial industry development effort, as they had the world’s largest
       number of certified accountants.

By Source Markets

   •   There is an opportunity to target Australia and New Zealand as primary markets. They offer a
       sizeable nearshoring market to be tapped, and the three countries have useable comparative
       advantage in terms of cultural affinity and positive associations of the countries as tourist
       destinations.
   •   There is also an opportunity to target the United Kingdom and Europe as secondary markets. In
       particular, Fiji can offer British clients a high level of English skills, and use MindPearl’s success
       as reference. The European Outsourcing Association Award 2014 also provides an excellent
       testimonial for targeting the European market.

By Operational and Client Size

   •   The three countries are likely to be more successful by serving mainly small (<$10 million revenue)
       or emerging ($10 to 100 million revenue) sized clients, as the three countries have limited
       scalability of labor.
   •   The three countries could also target medium-size companies because of their growing global
       demand for GOS (Avasant 2012).
   •   The three countries are unlikely to be able to serve enterprise-size clients in a large scale, but could
       offer limited BPO operations as alternatives or backup operations to these clients' needs for
       redundancy or 24/7 support. Enterprise clients have typically larger labor pool requirements, and
       generally prefer service providers to offer total outsourcing solutions (that is, countries that can
       offer various kinds of ITO/BPO/KPO to meet their complete outsourcing needs, not just BPO).

By Traditional versus OO Approaches

   •   Both approaches are complementary and are not mutually exclusive, from both the industry
       development and job creation perspectives.
   •   PICs are generally more competitive in OO because the traditional approaches
       (nearshoring/offshoring) are affected more by the inherent challenges of small size and geographic
       distance.

    •   The overall job impact may be higher for traditional outsourcing because of its significantly larger
        global market size.
    •   OO is not expected to create as many jobs because the global market ($2 billion out of $852 billion)
        is relatively small at this infant stage. Moreover, jobs are highly competitive because workers have
        to compete internationally for each piece of work offered online.

Conclusion
The global outsourcing services industry appears to have significant job creation potential in Fiji, Samoa,
and Tonga. In Fiji, for example, the study estimates it could create 1,936 to 5,809 direct jobs.

Improving Internet connectivity has made it more feasible for the PICs to examine GOS as a new and
innovative channel for job creation. GOS also allows the three countries to compete more effectively than
in other industries, since it requires relatively less physical movement of people and exchanges of goods.

In addition, the industry’s impact goes beyond job creation. The three countries can develop a completely
new industry, with the potential to contribute between 0.38 and 3.52 percent to the countries’ GDP. Such a
new service-based, digital economy industry for the PICs could also contribute to the region’s next phase
of growth and development.

The three countries enjoy several comparative advantages, such as having the youngest workforce in the
world, the relative ease of doing business, and a significant nearshoring opportunity with Australia and
New Zealand. These are the main selling points that the three countries could build upon to further their
industry development initiatives. Fiji could also leverage its existing experience and reputation (with ANZ
and Mindpearl), its comparatively competitive skills base, costs, and infrastructure, as well as its attractive
investment incentives for setting up BPO operations.

As discussed above, it is important to note that stakeholders' expectations about the industry’s job impact
on these countries must be managed. Private sector development alone is unlikely to spur sufficient work
to meet emerging job demands in the PICs (World Bank 2014). This is because the inherent challenges of
size, distance, remoteness, and isolation remain key constraints for the much larger traditional global
outsourcing services market. The OO industry is promising as it helps to overcome these inherent
challenges but this industry segment's size remains limited compared to the traditional outsourcing segment.

Chapter 8. Recommendations
General
The main recommendation is for the three countries to take a phased and focused approach to develop their
country’s global outsourcing services industry. Although the analysis identified a few areas of potential
comparative advantages, it did not find particularly unique or compelling strengths in the three countries to
attract the GOS industry. Consequently, the three countries should maintain a cautiously optimistic
perspective as the industry is relatively new to the region, as the much larger traditional market for
nearshoring/offshoring is already mature, and given that only Fiji has some experience and operations in
place.

One of the three countries could conduct global outsourcing services industry development pilots in the
short term, and take the next steps for industry development, provided that the pilots prove that the industry
is feasible. While holistic, long-term interventions are essential for developing the PIC's global outsourcing
industry, it is also important to identify short-term initiatives that can be easily managed and quickly
implemented to test the feasibility of GOS from a practical perspective, and to provide a stronger basis for
longer-term interventions.

From a region-wide industry development perspective, the PICs could also consider taking a “flying geese”
approach (National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies) in their efforts to grow their respective GOS
industry. Such an approach would be based on a regional division of labor pattern as illustrated by East
Asia’s rapid development. It describes a regional hierarchy where the production of commoditized goods
and services move continuously from the more advanced countries to the less advanced ones. In East Asia’s
case, Japan was the lead country, followed by the newly industrialized countries (Hong Kong, Singapore,
South Korea, and Taiwan), then the main ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia), and
finally the least developed nations (China, Vietnam, and the Philippines). Hence, the possible sequence or
pattern for the PICs could have Fiji as the lead country in the first phase, because of the numerous reasons
identified in the SWOT analysis. Tonga and Samoa would be in the second phase, because of their higher
connectivity readiness compared to the rest of the PICs. The remaining PICs would form final phase, as
connectivity in these countries improves and the region gathers expertise, experience, and visibility as
destinations for global outsourcing services.

Fiji could conduct two pilots on a trial and error basis to provide the practical guidance for the longer-term
industry development effort across the PICs. One of the pilots could be for nearshoring/offshoring
businesses, and another for OO. The total cost of the pilots is estimated at $5 million over 1.5 years,
assuming both pilots are implemented concurrently. The pilots should bring in quick wins in terms of job
creation, bringing deeper understanding and fine-tuning of the industry development effort for the next
stage of growth and expansion over the medium to long term, as well as industry development experience
for the other PICs. The pilot should also include activities that leverage key comparative advantages and
mitigates major weaknesses identified in this study.

The proposed pilots should take a conservative approach in terms of targeted industry services segments,
and aim for measured and quality industry growth. Fiji could focus at the lower end of the GOS value chain
(basic BPO services), since it already has experiences of such work and analysis suggests the three countries
are more competitive in this market segment. They should also focus on the priority tasks identified as
critical factors for success of the pilot and initial industry development effort.

There is also a need to bring in international expertise for the Fijian pilots, as knowledge and experience is
required to compete effectively in this global industry. International consulting firms could be engaged for

                                                                                   Report No: 96218-EAP


industry development planning, marketing and communications, business development, training, and so
on. 38

Depending on the pilot projects’ success, Fiji could also conduct medium to long-term industry
development projects in its next phase, while Samoa and Tonga initiate their activities. This next stage of
industry development for Fiji would aim to consolidate early competitive strengths, expand industry
coverage, and move up the value chain. The activities could be focused on longer-term issues, including:

    •   The development of a long-term industry vision, strategy, and action plans,
    •   Workforce training and company certification to international industry standards,
    •   Policy and regulatory adjustments for industry growth,
    •   Expanded marketing and business development support, and
    •   Additional incentives and support to encourage industry towards higher value-added services.

The pilots would also provide a more concrete foundation to identify the critical success factors for long-
term GOS industry development in Fiji, and focus on these during the next stage of industry development
in the country and across the region. These factors are expected to include:

Broadband Internet: Continued connectivity improvements in terms of speeds, reliability, and prices for
GOS businesses and individuals. High connectivity costs may hinder foreign investment as well as growth
of existing firms. In addition to physical infrastructure investments, a strong regulatory framework that
promotes further competition based on open licensing regimes and robust infrastructure sharing would be
vital to improve access and lower costs.

Business environment: Continued efforts to improve the business environment as represented by the Doing
Business rankings. Address the issue of lengthy and complicated administrative procedures by providing a
review of government requirements and develop a streamlined process for foreign investors that seek to
setup businesses.

Talent pool: Improving the quality and quantity of the talent base for the GOS industry, in collaboration
with the private sector and academia, in areas such as:

    •   Improved IT skills of new graduates for high value ITO work.
    •   Increased number of graduates in various horizontal skills, such as accounting or human resources
        management to support higher value added tasks in BPO.
    •   Public-private sector collaboration in training and certification based on the industry's specific
        needs. Dedicated efforts by the government will be needed to ensure the private sector collaborates
        more closely with universities to close the education-market gap. Further, developing basic ICT
        skills at basic/primary education levels are key in the planning of a knowledge-based society. This
        could be done by reforming the educational curriculum and raising awareness of teachers and
        parents.

Diaspora: Developing policies to better engage the Fijian diaspora. Possible options for exploration
includes offering dual citizenship, tax breaks for diaspora companies, and other measures to boost
investment and develop private sector capacity.

ICT sector development: Structural weaknesses in the ICT sector are one of the main challenges to the
development of the sector. Increased government and private sector collaboration is needed to improve the
enabling environment, in areas such as:

    •   Government’s continued assistance and support to the private sector in promoting and representing
        the industry to external clients;


                                                    42

     •   Improving the policy, regulatory, and incentive structure for GOS businesses and individual
         workers; and
     •   Establishing policy, regulatory, and legal frameworks to mitigate cybersecurity related risks.




Pilot on Traditional GOS
This pilot would aim to catalyze industry growth in Fiji by bringing in more flagship or anchor clients 39,
and assisting existing GOS operations in the country to expand their operations. This would provide
practical lessons and use as industry references for the country and region's industry growth. It would focus
on opportunities in BPO in general, given the country's greater comparative advantage in this industry
subsegment, and would be open various forms of operations in order to extract useful practical learning,
including nearshoring or offshoring, and captive or noncaptive operations in the piloting country.

The overall scope of the pilot could include the creation of 1,000 more direct jobs and 2,500 indirect jobs
(based on the industry average of 1 direct to 2.5 indirect jobs). The cost and duration of the pilot is estimated
at $4.5 million over 1.5 years.

The pilot's value proposition would be based on the unique selling proposition discussed above. The
competitive positioning of Fiji could be based on various dimensions. For segment offerings, Fiji could
provide voice-based BPO services, such as telemarketing and call centers, and nonvoice based services,
such as data entry and digitization that are not sector specific at this exploratory stage. With regard to
source markets, the piloting country could target Australia and New Zealand as the primary market for
nearshoring, with the United Kingdom and Europe as the secondary market for offshoring. With regard to
client industry and size, it is proposed for Fiji to avoid industry-specific focus at this stage, and target small
to medium-sized companies to tap into their growing demands for GOS.

The key activities for the pilot would include activities across the four dimensions of analysis. These key
activities would include:

     •   Provision of additional industry specific incentives in wage, training subsidies, and tax exemption
         for pioneer companies;
     •   Identifying potential local BPO services providers (for offshoring), and set up of an industry
         association focused on GOS, for example, NASSCOM in India, and IT and Business Association
         of the Philippines (IBPAP);
     •   Establishing a high-level industry champion within government;
     •   Developing a short-term industry development strategy;
     •   Conducting a holistic marketing and communications program to mitigate the low awareness and
         perception issues; and
     •   Providing comprehensive business development assistance for the government and the private
         sector for the entire process from qualifying, negotiating, and closing business opportunities.

The details for the proposed pilot program for traditional GOS are shown in Table 8.1.

Pilot on Online Outsourcing
The OO pilot would be aimed at practical testing of this relatively new industry from various perspectives.
It would assess the willingness of high-school graduates and female homemakers to do lower task types
(for example, data entry, digitization, image rendering, and so on), and graduates and undergraduates’
willingness to undertake and competitiveness in higher task types (for example, programming, search
engine optimization, web page design, graphic design, and so on). It would also provide insights on the
long-term interest and sustainability of workers or businesses in OO, and help the pilot's workers to win
and perform actual jobs on international OO platforms.

The scope of this pilot is for activities to create 300 jobs, and the estimated cost and duration is $500,000
over one year. An intermediary/agency approach is more suitable for the OO approach because of the varied
types of issues and support needed. Such an intermediary has multiple roles, to:

•   Provide working facilities with computers and the Internet.
•   Recruit a specified number of workers from different demographic groups, including high-school and
    university graduates, women and disabled persons, and across occupational groups including the
    unemployed, students, and housewives.
•   Contract with workers and formalize the workforce for labor rights and tax purposes.
•   Provide classrooms and hands-on training in OO, actual use of the OO platforms, and assistance for
    workers to win and deliver their first jobs.
•   Enable receipt of remuneration by individual workers, through bulk receipt of payments on the workers'
    behalf, and distribution to each worker through local bank mechanisms.
•   Conduct comprehensive monitoring and evaluation, and provide comprehensive operational reports on:
    o Worker numbers, profiles, and work patterns (percentage of work done at home or shared facilities,
        hours worked, types of tasks performed, earnings, and so on).
    o Systems for recruiting, training, rostering of workers, shared use of facilities, payment mechanisms,
        and so on.
    o Audited accounts of payments to workers.

There are also various unique implementation factors that should be taken into account for the OO pilot.
The pilot should contract with an organization (business, academia or NGO) as intermediary to conduct
most of the pilot’s activities, as this will help to provide useful lessons on interest of different types of
organization and their ability to function as intermediaries in the longer term. The pilot may also have to
be conducted in the main islands or more developed urban areas as they have significantly better last-mile
Internet connectivity, and could provide quick wins. The pilot should also consist of at least two operational
set-ups in different locations, to cater for different task types and levels, demographics, and work. It should
also bring in international expertise to help kick start the industry, given the lack of experience in each of
the three countries in the global OO marketplace. The details for the proposed pilot program for OO are
shown in Table 8.2.
