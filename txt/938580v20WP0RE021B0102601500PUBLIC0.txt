52     THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE OF OIL AND GROWTH




       BOX 1: A Stylized Example of the HOI

       Consider two countries, A and B, each with a total population equally        Country A
       distributed in 10 western communities and 10 eastern communities.
       The coverage rate of school enrollment (or the average enrollment rate)
       for both countries are 0.6, i.e. children in 60 percent of the communities
       attend school in each country. In the figure, red-colored communities
       illustrate covered communities. It is evident that access to school is
       distributed differently among the population in country A and B. In
       country B, children in western communities have a 20% probability
       of access to schooling, whereas the probability is 100% for eastern
       communities.
       Equality of opportunity will hold true for each country if western
                                                                                    Country B
       and eastern communities have the same rate of coverage. However,
       while in country A school coverage is 60% in western and eastern
       communities, this is not true in country B. This suggests that inequality
       of opportunities is higher in country B. The D-index is the share of total
       enrollment that is “misallocated”, namely 0/12 and 4/12 for A and B,
       respectively. The HOI is then calculated as the coverage rate multiplied
       by 1 minus the D-index (the share that is equitably allocated). In other
       words, the HOI penalizes country B for its inequitable coverage rate
       relative to country A. Therefore, HOIA = C0 (1-D) = 0.6 * (1–0) = 0.60;
       HOIB = C0 (1-D) = 0.6 * (.33) = 0.40.

    BOX 2: Long Term Implications of Malnutrition in Early Childhood

    Health in the earliest years—actually beginning with the future mother’s health before she becomes pregnant—lays the groundwork for a lifetime of well-
    being. Health is directly influenced by nutrition, beginning with the mother’s pre-conception nutritional status, extending through pregnancy to early infant
    feeding, and continuing with diet and activity throughout childhood and into adult life. Adequate intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients is particularly
    important in the early months and years of life, when body growth and brain development are more rapid than during any other period. Malnourished children
    score poorer on tests of cognitive function, have poorer psychomotor development and fine motor skills, have lower activity levels, interact less frequently in
    their environments, and fail to acquire skills at normal rates.
    The causal nature of such a relationship is indicated by several studies linking the improvement of diets to better motor and mental development for children.
    A randomized study of supplement distribution during pregnancy and early childhood in Guatemala showed that, not only were treated children observed
    to have improved cognitive development in preschool years (Martorell 1997), when the cohort was followed into adult years, the treatment group gained
    significantly higher schooling and wages (Maluccio et al. 2005). Glewwe, Jacoby, and King (2001) track children from birth through primary school and find
    that better nourished children start school earlier and repeat fewer grades, controlling for family characteristics. Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey (2006) show
    that increased stunting of children younger than age 2 in Zimbabwe has a causal impact on years of schooling completed 15 years after the nutritional shock.
    In Colombia, infants born to families at risk of malnutrition that received nutritional supplementation performed better than those who did not, especially on
    subtests that were primarily motoric (Super et al, 1990).
    Childhood nutrition not only reduces child mortality but has major economic returns coming from reduced cost of health care and increased productivity of the
    population over a lifetime. Nutrition impacts not only on survival, but on child development, school retention and achievement.

          BOX 3: Early Motherhood and Child Outcomes

          Early motherhood is often believed to cause adverse outcomes for children, such as lower birth weights, education, work experience and wages, more persistent
          poverty and welfare dependency, and higher rates of infant mortality. Evidence on this subject is, however, mixed. While on the one hand there are several
          studies arguing that the adverse effects of teenage childbearing primarily reflect unmeasured family background rather than the true consequences of a teen
          birth, other contributions show that controlling for family background does not fully eliminate the adverse consequences of early motherhood for children.
          Levine et al (2001) find that find that early motherhood’s strong negative correlation with children’s test scores and positive correlation with children’s grade
          repetition is almost entirely explained by pre-birth individual and family background factors of teen mothers themselves. However, controlling for maternal
          background, the authors show that children of teen mothers in the United States are more likely to initiate early sexual activity and to display problem behaviors
          such as truancy and fighting.
          Based on 1991 and 1999 data for the UK, Francesconi (1997) finds that being born to a teenage mother is usually associated with worse outcomes as young
          adults: lower chances of higher educational attainment, greater risks of inactivity and teenage childbearing, smaller probability of being in the top decile of the
          income distribution and greater probability of being in the bottom decile of the earnings distribution. These results hold true even after controlling for common
          family or maternal background factors.
          Geronimus et al (1992) estimates the relationship between maternal age and low birth weight, preterm birth, indicators of prenatal care utilization, smoking
          and alcohol use during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and well-child visits. The study controls for pre-pregnancy family background differences between teen and
          older mothers by comparing sisters who experienced their first births at different ages. The findings show evidence that maternal family background accounts
          for many of the health-related disadvantages of the firstborn infants of teenage mothers.
          Raj et al (2010) find that, in a nationally representative sample for India, children born to women married as minors are significantly more vulnerable to
          malnutrition than those born to women married at 18. The authors show that these associations were not simply a consequence of socioeconomic vulnerabilities
          of mothers, or of maternal malnutrition as indicated by low BMI. They hypothesize that perhaps young mothers may be unable to ensure adequate nutrition
          for their children, and that combined with the limited nutritional reserves stored within the bodies of adolescent mothers probably places their offspring at
          substantial risk for low birth weight and inadequate access to breast milk. The findings suggest that the effects of inadequate fetal nutrition and reduced
          breastfeeding among neonates born to adolescent mothers extend into infancy and early childhood, maintaining their ongoing risk for malnutrition related
          health problems and suggesting that such vulnerabilities accumulate over the lifespan.

    BOX 4: Doing Business in Iraq – Main Messages from the Investment Climate Assessment 2012

    The private sector has limited presence and incentives for its expansion are nearly absent in Iraq. Accordingly to the last Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for
    Iraq, this is a consequence of decades of socialist economic policy which have tightly bound Iraq’s economy to the state. Although the potential for private sector
    engagement in post-conflict Iraq is significant, the country’s private sector is both under-developed and unsupported. Most private businesses in Iraq are very
    small and informal, mainly operating in retail and trade, construction and transportation services, as well as in light industry in the textile, food, engineering,
    and chemicals fields.
    The Enterprise Survey suggests significantly higher costs of doing business in Iraq than elsewhere in the region. Respondents to this survey listed electricity,
    instability, and corruption as the three most severe obstacles to doing business in Iraq. The average firm suffered nearly 600 power interruptions per year, with
    some firms reporting three outages per day. This unstable power supply results in significant sales losses. As a reflection of the political instability in Iraq, security
    and crime are also major concerns, with many surveyed firms spending considerably on protection. Note however, that the importance of these problems
    often varies significantly between regions and sectors. Corruption further acts as an economic burden on firms surveyed, with firms reporting that bribes are
    commonplace, often to smooth frequent inspections from authorities, including government agencies and municipal police forces.
    Among other problems identified by this report are the following: poor access to finance and land; and competition from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
    and the informal sector. Credit systems and access to finance are severely limited because of the state’s long-term dominance. Nearly half of the firms
    surveyed reported having great difficulty in obtaining financing; fewer than 7% reported having a loan. Some small and micro-enterprises have no access to
    banks with markedly difficulties for the smaller ones. Firms also reported poor access to land for investment in general caused by widespread government
    ownership of prime land and inefficient methods of allocation to the private sector. With regard to competition from the informal sector, firms report
    difficulties confronting competition from unregistered companies, many of which infringe upon the rights of registered businesses, and face lower costs due
    to their noncompliance with formal rules.
    These are few of multiple constraints that private firms faced on doing business in Iraq such as proper transport or access to adequate labor force. It is not
    surprising that the ICA report emphasizes the fact that The World Bank’s Doing Business 2012 Report ends ranking Iraq 164 out of 183 economies. Iraq ranks
    second to last amongst the economies in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), significantly behind regional best performers on a global level such as
    Saudi Arabia (12), United Arab Emirates (33), and Qatar (36).

      Iraq’s historical endowment of agriculture has been
      steadily and it appears, irrevocably eroding. In 1971,
      agriculture accounted for 16 percent of value added,
      around a fifth of GDP and 55 percent of total em-
      ployment. At the time, it was recognized as a lagging
      sector, with little investment towards increasing pro-
      ductivity and building the necessary infrastructure.
      A 1974 World Bank report notes that “agricultural
      yields, reflected centuries of abuse and neglect of the
      land, much of which had been allowed to deteriorate
      to the point of being uncultivable.”47

        BOX 5: PDS Ration Items and the Valuation Problem

        The IHSES surveys collect information about the quantity of ration items received, consumed and purchased. The 2007 methodology used a notion of ‘net
        quantity received’ and purchases of ration items recorded in the diary on a monthly basis (very few transactions) to measure the quantity of rations consumed.
        The former is the quantity of ration items received, net of amounts bartered, sold, or given away. However, this measure has no clearly defined recall period, such
        as the last week or the last month. Moreover, since receipts are not consumption, they may not reflect utility. Two households who receive the same amount of
        rations, but consume very different amounts, derive different utility from rations.
        The IHSES surveys also include a direct question on consumption of ration items within the last 30 days. This is a more accurate measure of consumption, with a
        clear recall period, and equal consumption implies equal utility derived for households. This is the primary measure of consumption of ration items in the revised
        methodology. Purchases of ration items in the diary (over the last week) are converted into monthly equivalents, and also included, as households who purchase
        additional rations on the market must be assigned higher consumption and thereby utility.
        How is this important component of food consumption to be valued? In principle, goods and services ought to be valued equal to their infra-marginal benefit;
        i.e.; the market price faced for the marginal unit consumed. In the case of Iraq, ration items are rarely traded and in this sense, a market-equivalent price does not
        exist. A few transactions are recorded in the diary but these are insufficient to calculate unit values, and moreover, are associated with a select few households
        who are quantity constrained. So these unit values cannot be used to value all ration consumption.
        Another possibility is to use official prices for ration items, which are very low, nominal prices paid by consumers. Using these heavily subsidized prices would
        artificially suppress the value of food expenditures stemming from rations. Moreover, rations should be valued at a price close to one at which we expect these
        items to be traded; and official prices are not the prices at which households can procure unlimited quantities.
        Is there a close substitute to ration items that are traded in the market? In the case of Iraq, unit values for these substitutes are significantly higher for some
        items, especially rice, suggesting important quality differences. This implies that market prices for commercially available items cannot be used because they
        are not perfect substitutes.
        The only remaining candidate to value rations is a question that asks households their opinion on how much they would pay for ration-equivalent items in the
        market. In practice, few households expressed an opinion, and enumerators approached the local ration agent in the cluster, in a manner akin to a price survey.
        However, there were variations in these prices that may reflect uncertainty, noise and local variations in supply, demand and quality. In order to ensure that all
        those who consume exactly the same amount of a ration item are assigned the same expenditure; and that this expenditure increases with higher consumption;
        it was decided to use the national median values of prices reported by ration agents to value ration items.
