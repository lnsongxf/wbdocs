I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in the
        Dominican Republic perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in the Dominican Republic regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in the Dominican Republic;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in the Dominican Republic;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in the Dominican
               Republic; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in the Dominican Republic.

       Use data to help inform the Dominican Republic country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In January 2013, 505 stakeholders of the World Bank in the Dominican Republic were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of the Vice President; the office of a Minister; the office of the Congress; the judiciary branch;
employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; local government
officials or staff; independent government institutions; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; the media; NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); trade unions;
faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; bilateral agencies; and multilateral
agencies. A total of 275 stakeholders participated in the country survey (54%).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned it accordingly or completed
questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing the Dominican Republic, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in the Dominican Republic, and the Bank’s communication
and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues facing the Dominican Republic: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   the Dominican Republic was headed in the right or wrong direction, the most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in the Dominican Republic.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in the Dominican Republic, Bank staff
   preparedness, the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development
   agenda, agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to
   which the Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate
   the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources,
   the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in the Dominican Republic, with which groups the
   Bank should work more, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty-two development areas, the extent to which the Bank’s work helps
   achieve sustainable development results, and the extent to which the Bank meets the
   Dominican Republic’s needs for financial instruments and knowledge services.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities (i.e., Analysis, Studies, Research, Data,
   Reports, Conferences): Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they consult
   Bank knowledge work and activities in the work they do, the areas on which the Bank should
   focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with a series
   of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in the Dominican Republic: Respondents were asked to
   rate how significant a role the Bank should play in the Dominican Republic’s development in
   the near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in the Dominican Republic, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 180 respondents (52% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2009 and the 218 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the survey in FY
2005. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the Vice
        President and the office of the Congress were combined with those from the office of the
        President, respondents from PMUs were combined with consultants on Bank projects,
        respondents from multilateral agencies were combined with those from bilateral agencies,
        respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the
        private sector, respondents from private foundations and faith-based groups were
        combined with those from NGOs, and the few respondents from the office of a Minister,
        the judiciary branch, and local government were included in “Other”.

Geographic Location

       Because of the small number of respondents from areas in the North/Cibao,
        South/Southwest, or East, these respondents were combined into an “Other Areas”
        category. Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be
        found in the Appendix (see page 82). Only significant differences between geographic
        locations in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.6; this was
        statistically similar to the mean rating received in the FY ’09 country survey (6.8) and the
        FY ’05 country survey (6.4).
             Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects had the highest
                 levels of familiarity with the Bank whereas respondents from bilateral or
                 multilateral agencies had significantly lower levels of familiarity.
             Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of
                 familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
                 significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
                 effectiveness in the Dominican Republic, the Bank’s ability to help achieve
                 sustainable development results, and the Bank’s relevance to the Dominican
                 Republic’s development.

IV. General Issues facing the Dominican Republic

Headed in the Right Direction

       Over half of all respondents indicated that the Dominican Republic is headed in the right
        direction.
             Although the majority of respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that
              the Dominican Republic is headed in the right direction, the majority of
              respondents from the media indicated that the Dominican Republic was headed in
              wrong direction, and respondents from NGOs/private foundations/faith-based
              groups and academia/research institutes/think tanks were split between the
              Dominican Republic being headed in the right direction, wrong direction, and
              being not sure.

The World Bank’s Overall Effectiveness in the Dominican Republic (Indicator Question)

       Across all respondents, ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness in the
        Dominican Republic received a mean rating of 6.9; this was statistically similar to the
        mean overall effectiveness rating received in the FY ’09 country survey ( 7.1) and in the
        FY ’05 country survey (7.2).
             Respondents across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations had
              statistically similar ratings for the Bank’s overall effectiveness in the
              Dominican Republic.

       Ratings of the World Bank’s work achieving sustainable de velopment results in the
        Dominican Republic received a mean rating of 6.7 across all respondents.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant differences between stakeholder groups in their ratings of the
        Bank’s effectiveness across several of these thirty-two areas (see the Appendix for full
        details). For the most part, respondents from independent government institutions,
        PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects, and academia/research institutes had the
        highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas whereas respondents from
        the private sector/ financial sector/private banks had significantly lower ratings for the
        Bank’s effectiveness. Those areas with significant differences were:
             Anti-corruption;
             Information and communications technology;
             Law and justice;
             Poverty reduction;
             Energy;
             Public sector governance/reform;
             Education;
             Climate change; and
             Mining and extractive industries.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       Respondents in this year’s country survey gave statistically similar ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness across all areas that could be compared to respondents in the FY ’09 survey,
        but significantly lower ratings in some areas compared to respondents in the FY ’05
        survey (those differences that reached statistical significance are noted in the graph).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in the Dominican Republic,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-two
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s abilit y to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in the Dominican Republic.
        The area determined to be a key driver from these analyses was:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security and nutrition.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’09 country survey were:
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to empower communities to participate in
                  their own development;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to reduce poverty;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to bring about economic growth; and
              o The Bank’s effectiveness at helping to strengthen the education sector.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related
        to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in the
        Dominican Republic, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development
        results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security and nutrition; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates

The World Bank’s Work in the Dominican Republic

       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
        that the World Bank supports programs and strategies that are realistic for the Dominican
        Republic compared to respondents from the FY ’09 country survey, but significantly
        lower levels of agreement that the World Bank’s work is aligned with respondents’
        development priorities compared to respondents from the FY ’05 country survey. All
        other comparisons across country surveys were statistically similar.
       Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects had the highest levels
        of agreement that the World Bank supports programs and strategies that are realistic, that
        the World Bank plays a relevant role in the Dominican Republic’s development, and that
        the World Bank’s work is aligned with respondents’ development priorities whereas
        respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)

Overall Perceptions

       Respondents in this year’s country survey had statistically similar levels of agreement
        across all the aspects of how the World Bank operates that could be compared to
        respondents from the FY ’09 and FY ’05 country surveys.
       There were four instances in which there were stakeholder group differences in their level
        of agreement regarding these aspects of how the World Bank operates (see the Appendix
        for details). Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects and
        academia tended to have the highest levels of agreement for these aspects whereas
        respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and bilateral or
        multilateral agencies tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement. Those
        aspects with significant differences were that the Bank disburses funds promptly, that the
        Bank imposes reasonable conditions on its lending, that working with the Bank increases
        institutional capacity, and that the Bank’s teams and visits are well coordinated.

        to respondents from the FY ’09 (6.5 and 6.6, respectively) and FY ’05 surveys (6.7 and
        6.6, respectively).
       Respondents from independent government institutions, PMUs/consultants on Bank-
