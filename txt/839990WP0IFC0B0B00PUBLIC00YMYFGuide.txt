Your Money, Your Future (referred to as the “Guide” throughout) was created to assist
potential student borrowers and their families in making decisions regarding money
management.

The Guide is intended for students who are considering attending or are already enrolled
in a tertiary education institution (tertiary education includes university, technical and
vocational training, and any other studies completed after secondary school). The Guide
covers topics such as student loans, goal-setting, repaying debt, and aims to educate
students – and their families – in ways that will make them better money managers and
more responsible borrowers throughout their university careers and beyond.

Many of the topics raised in the Guide will be completely new to you and some may not
seem directly relevant to your current nancial situation. However, preparing to make smart
  nancial decisions early in your life will lead to fewer mistakes and more opportunities to
be nancially successful in the future. Additionally, information covered in the Guide may
be important for your parents, particularly in the scenario where you and your family would
incur debt in the form of a student loan. Therefore, it is critical that you take time to share
this information with your parents. They may be able to o er insight on the lessons they
learned throughout the course of their lives and may also bene t from new concepts raised
in the Guide.

The most important thing to remember when working through the Guide is that there
is not one right approach to managing your money. As discussed throughout the Guide,
everyone has di erent goals and ambitions, and consequently, will save, borrow and earn
money di erently. This Guide will teach you basic concepts and knowledge about nancial
management. It is intended that this foundation will empower you to make the right
  nancial decisions now and in the future so that you can achieve your goals.

For the purposes of illustration, the Dinar (a currency used in several countries) is referred
to throughout the Guide. However, the content of this Guide is transferable across countries
and their respective currencies.

For many people, money concerns are at the top of the list of anxieties that preoccupy their
daily thoughts. Why does dealing with money seem so problematic? It could be because
very few people have had the opportunity to be educated in personal nancial matters.
Lack of nancial education is especially common among young adults, who may be earning
income, borrowing money or thinking about their nancial future for the rst time.

Without proper nancial education, young adults make
uninformed decisions that usually result in a pattern
of poor nancial management. As personal nance           This Guide will provide

presented as an educational tool to assist you and your
family in making wise nancial decisions as you commence
your university studies and throughout your lives.

For many young adults, a student loan may be the rst signi cant loan for which they are
responsible. Entering the world of nance will involve many such decisions; some of which
may have implications for many years to come. However, knowledgeable consumers usually
make more intelligent decisions than consumers who are less informed. After having read
and studied this Guide, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to help you
navigate the world of personal nance and hopefully avoid making costly money mistakes.

Setting Goals
Personal nance is about setting goals, making choices and following through. In the next
few years, you will nd that managing your money will become an increasingly important
part of your life. Even if you do not have much cash to work with now, it is well worth it to
start learning all you can about how to manage your money. When you begin to earn an
income, you will be aware of your options, what mistakes to avoid, and what steps to take
to achieve the best possible outcome. Those who start planning early will be poised for
  nancial success.

Chapter 1: Basic Financial Issues             5
When it comes to setting goals, many people neglect to create nancial goals. They develop
goals for other parts of their life such as major area of study while in university, desired
profession, marriage plans, or summer vacation. But when it comes to money, they earn it
and they spend it without a plan. Usually when they earn more money, they spend more as
well. In this scenario, if they had a plan, they might elect to use their additional income to
increase their savings or to pay down their debt obligations.

The rst step in setting nancial goals is to decide what goals are important to you. No two
people are identical in their goals and aspirations. You may wish to save money for a car, a
mobile phone, clothes, a computer or the future purchase of a home. There is no right or
wrong answer regarding which goals are the best for you. It is a personal decision to be
made after much re ection on your current nancial situation and what you would like to
accomplish in the future.

Opportunity Cost

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best choice that one gives up when making a
                            decision. By de nition, any decision that is made causes other
                                decisions that could have been made to be abandoned. If
                                   one drives north, they cannot drive south. In another
                                    instance, if a family decides to use 1,000 dinars to add
                                      an extra room onto their house, the opportunity
                                       cost is some other thing for which the 1,000 dinars
                                       could have been used. In choosing to add the
                                        extra room, the family might have forgone the
                                        opportunity to take a family vacation or replace an
                                       aging car with a newer one.

                                       Electing to continue your studies also involves an
                                      opportunity cost. If you decided NOT to pursue your
                                    education, what would you do instead? Would you
                                 get married, nd a job, or travel? In addition to short-
                             term trade-o s, what would be the long-term trade-o if you
                   decided to abandon the higher education goal? Would you be trapped
in lower paying jobs and / or have fewer job opportunities?

Data from many countries illustrate the positive link between higher education levels and
unemployment. For example, in Chile, higher unemployment rates exist among those with
only secondary or incomplete college education.1

Other research shows the impact between education level and salary/job quality. For
example, in Brazil, on average the salary of a college graduate is worth almost three times
the salary of a worker with a high school diploma.2 Furthermore, in Egypt among both
males and females with a secondary education and above, the quality of their rst job was
substantially greater than among those with less than a secondary education. This data
con rms a correlation between a higher education and increased and better quality job
opportunities.3

Your decision to pursue and attain a higher degree is not one to be taken lightly. It is a
choice that will be instrumental in the direction your life takes in the years to come. This
decision should always precede the discussion about funding. If you decide that a university
education is one of your life goals, you will then nd a way to pursue it – regardless of the
 nancial obstacles. Student loans provide one alternative way to make higher education
more a ordable (See Chapter 3).


Write Down Your Money Goals
The best way to accomplish a money goal or objective is to write it down. The simple act of
writing the goal on paper makes it more tangible and allows you to organize and prioritize.
Once the goal is written down, the mind starts working on ways to make this goal a reality.

Once you choose a general goal, you should write down the steps needed to achieve that
goal. By breaking up the goal into manageable pieces, it will not seem so overwhelming.
For example, you may decide to allocate an amount of money to be put toward your goal
every month. If you consistently put the money away in your savings, you will have the
money your goal requires by the end of the time period needed to reach your goal.

If this monthly savings amount is too high for your budget, you may have to extend the
time period needed to save the total amount. Almost any goal is possible if you are willing
to adjust the monthly amount saved or the time period required to achieve
your goal. The only other factor for success is having the will to succeed
and making sure that your chosen goal is not an impossible one to
achieve.                                                                   Do not be afraid
                                                                   to ask questions. There
Money Should Not Be a Taboo Subject
                                                                   are no wrong questions
Do not be afraid to ask questions. There are no wrong questions when it comes to making

understood. Sometimes people are embarrassed to ask questions
if they do not understand nancial transactions. They feel that they
should already know the answer. Therefore they opt to remain confused
rather than risk sounding like they are not nancially savvy.

This logic incorrectly assumes that others understand money better than you do. Just
because someone is a professional, does not mean that he or she knows how to manage
their own money. Further, a high-income individual may not be a successful money manager.
His or her nancial bottom line may be much worse than someone from a lower-paying
profession. It is not a matter of how much you earn, but rather what you spend in relation
to what you earn that counts.

Resolve to talk about money as much as possible. Talk with your family and representatives
from your local bank. Setting a budget, debt reduction, investment strategies and cost-
cutting ideas are ideal topics for money conversations. The frequency of these conversations
and the comfort level you have with discussing your nances will almost certainly have a
direct correlation. The more you talk, the more comfortable you will be.

                                    How Do You Spend your Money?

Any time you spend money, it is a nancial activity, right? And any time there is a nancial
activity there is some sort of nancial decision involved. Some are relatively minor: How
much should I give the waiter for a tip? Should I go see a movie, or wait for it to come out on
DVD? In these cases, how you decide to spend your money is not likely to have a big impact
on your nancial wellbeing. (Of course, these minor decisions and activities can quickly add
up, and their cumulative e ect can be signi cant!)

Still, there are some nancial decisions and activities that can have a major impact all by
themselves. Should I enroll in a university that will require me to obtain a loan? Should I buy
a new phone?

                     Minor Financial Activities        Major Financial Activities
                        Movie or DVD rental                New cell phone
                                    Bus ride             University education
                                    Co ee                    Automobile

When you are young and live with your parents, your nancial decisions and activities are
probably all minor (even though they may not always seem that way!) When you leave
home, they increase in number and complexity. So what about now? What kinds of nancial
decisions and responsibilities do you have? How do you typically spend your money?

Figure Out Your Finances
Follow these steps to help identify and analyze your recent nancial decisions and spending
activities. Examining your nancial activities and decisions will help you better manage
your nances now and in the future.

     1. List your nancial activities and decisions over the last month. Your list should provide
        a picture of how you spend your money and what kind of nancial responsibilities
        you have. Do not worry about organizing your list — simply write down whatever
        comes to mind. If there is a consistent activity, such as buying lunch, just list it once.

     2. Organize your list. Look at your list and group the nancial activities and decisions,
        similar to the example below. Create di erent groupings, such as:
          •    Relative size of the activity/decision — Is it a minor spending activity/decision?
               Is it a major activity/decision?
          •    Frequency of the activity/decision — Are there some activities/decisions that
               occurred often during the past month? Some that occurred only a few times?
               Some that happened just once?
          •    Necessity of the spending — Are there some activities/decisions that you had to
               do? Are there others that you chose to do?
          •    People involved in the activity/decision — Is it an activity/decision that involved
               only you? Is it one that involved others?

              Activity                 Major/Minor?     Frequency?     Necessary?       Others
                                                                                      Involved?
        Lunch at school                    Minor            Daily          Yes           No




     3. Look for patterns and di erences. Are certain activities and decisions consistently
        grouped together? For example, are those related to entertainment or those
        involving friends often together? What other patterns do you detect? How are your
        spending decisions and activities di erent from one another?

Take It Another Step
Speculate on your alternatives. Another way to look at your nancial decisions and activities
is by thinking about what your alternatives were. Pick ve items from your lists and gure
out what you could have done di erently. What if you had chosen not to spend your money
the way you did? These alternatives are not necessarily positive or negative. As discussed
earlier in this chapter, these alternatives are often referred to as your opportunity costs.

Look backward and forward. What if you followed these same steps when you were 12 years
old? What items would have been on your list? What would some of your opportunity costs
have been? What about when you are 30? What do you speculate the items on your list
would be? Opportunity costs?

Now, here is a BIG question for you: What do you think is consistent about nancial decisions
and activities no matter how old you are? What do you think changes as you get older? Is it
the number of decisions? Is it the relative size of the decisions?

                                    Setting Goals for your Future

Where do you envision yourself in ve years? How about ten years? When will you nish
university? Are you working in your chosen career eld? How will you get there? What will it
cost? Re ecting on your daily life can help you prioritize what is important to you and what
you might want to change.

Take, for example, that afternoon co ee that you like to buy. Co ee = 1.20 dinars
It does not cost much each day, but if you think about it,    5 days / week = 6.00 dinars
you probably spend a lot more on co ee over one year than     Over one year = 330 dinars
you imagined. If one of your goals is to pay for university,
you might consider putting your co ee money into savings
instead of spending it one co ee at a time. Though some of these everyday actions and
  nancial decisions may be things that you really do enjoy, your priorities might change
when you consider your future.

Looking at the Long-Term
Follow the steps below to help you think about your goals for the future, and the nancial
goals you will need to set in order to achieve them.

     1. Answer the following questions to develop a baseline for your ideal future, keeping in
        mind that you will use the answers to these questions to help de ne speci c goals for
        yourself.

          a. Where do you want to go to university? How long will it take to earn a degree?
                ______________________________________________________________

          b. Where will you live while in university? (At home? At school? O campus?)
                ______________________________________________________________

          c. How much money do you think it will cost to attend university? (tuition, books, fees,
              etc.) ___________________________________________________________

          d. How will you pay for school? (Parents? Loans? Work?)
                ______________________________________________________________

          e. What might you have to give up if you go to university? What are the opportunity
              costs? _________________________________________________________

          f. What type of career would you like after university?

                ______________________________________________________________

Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 1: Basic Financial Issues                10
     2. Create a list of long-term goals for yourself based on your answers to the above
        questions. How long might it take to achieve these goals? How much money
        might be needed to achieve these goals? (At this point, it is ne to just guess.)

                Goal                       Length of Time Needed         Amount Needed
   Graduate from a two-year course               Two years                10,000 dinars




     3. Consider some of the themes that run through your goals. What are some of the
        main focuses? Can some of your goals be grouped together? What smaller goals
        would you need to accomplish in order to reach some of the bigger goals?


Take It Another Step

Discuss your goals with your parents. Ask them about some of the goals they had at your
age. Did they consider going to university? How did they accomplish their own goals? What
obstacles did they face? Were their own parents supportive of what they wanted to do with
their lives? What are some of the goals they still seek to achieve?

                               Creating and Managing a Budget

Although you may not yet have a source of income, understanding how to prepare a budget
is a critical element of becoming nancially literate. Talk to your family about this chapter.
Work with your parents on their household budget so that you can be aware of di erent
costs and expenses that you will incur in the future and how this relates to your future
income.

                  If the word ‘budget’ conjures up images of deprivation, think of it not as
                       some unpleasant chore or way to deny yourself, but as an empowering
         Too often       way to reach your nancial goals. Creating a budget is analogous to
                          cleaning a messy room. Although the actual task of cleaning may
          people
                           be time consuming, the end result is that your room is organized
         overspend         and in order.
    without even
     realizing it.       This is important because too often people overspend without
                        even realizing it. For example, if you are able to supplement your
                      income with money from your parents or with money from loans,
                  these funds may sustain an overspending situation. A budget will expose
the true situation, which has three possible outcomes:

     1. You spend more than you make.
     2. You spend every dinar you make.
     3. You spend less than you make.
Creating a budget is particularly important if your life situation has changed because
of events that prompt more independence such as attending university and eventual
relocation from your parents’ home. Future events like a rst full-time job, marriage or new
baby will lead to even more self-reliance over your nancial a airs.

These major events may alter your nances dramatically. Throughout your life, as you
journey through di erent life stages, the one constant map that will continue to provide
you with direction — is your budget. A sensible budget will always allow you to take control
of your money and not veer from your course.

Remember, a budget is a tool to help you plan, prioritize, and manage your income and
expenses. You need to review your budget often and update it whenever you experience a
change in circumstances.

Here are a few tips to help get you started:
   • Budgeting is not di cult, but getting started does take motivation. Promise yourself
       a reward for your e orts.
     •     Pay for items you need before those you want. Basic needs like food, shelter, medical



Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 2: Creating and Managing a Budget       13
         expenses and taxes should be paid rst. Anything left over can then be used for
         discretionary spending.
     •   Some expenses fall into both categories; they are both a want and a need. Shoes are
         a necessity but 20 pairs are not. Strive to limit your purchases to actual needs.
     •   There is no right or wrong way to allocate your money. We all have di erent nancial
         goals that we are striving to achieve.
     •   Do not give up. If you fall o your spending plan one month, readjust your spending
         the next month. The important thing is that you keep your ultimate nancial goals
         in mind.
     •   Budgeting takes practice and discipline but gets easier once you get in the habit and
         see positive results.

Step 1: Develop a Spending Plan
A spending plan, or budget, is your rst step toward building nancial responsibility. A
spending plan organizes your estimated income and expenses over a set period of time
— normally a month. Creating a budget means tracking your personal cash ow — that is,
how much money comes in and how much goes out.

A Spending Plan Can Help You:
   • Stay out of debt
     •   Identify areas of potential savings
     •   Provide a cushion for unforeseen expenses
     •   Save money for long-term goals
     •   Avoid impulse spending
Adding up your monthly income is usually relatively easy, but adding up all your expenses
takes a little more e ort. If you have not been keeping good records, you may have to
keep track of the money you spend for one month before you can enter numbers into your
budget.

Advance Preparation:
   • Gather information about any sources of income you may be receiving. This may
      include paycheck receipts from a part-time job, regular parental allowance, and
      monetary gifts for birthdays or holidays.
     •   Collect all your bills, checkbook register, and receipts for groceries, gas or anything
         else you buy with cash.
     •   Divide annual expense gures by 12 to determine monthly amounts, semiannual
          gures by 6, quarterly by 3, etc.
     •   Track where your money goes for those categories where you do not receive a bill
         or have receipts available (i.e. transportation and meals out). These expenses are



Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 2: Creating and Managing a Budget      14
             usually di cult to estimate. Therefore, the best way to get an accurate number is by
             making entries in a notebook — every time you spend money. This is most accurate
             when done for one month but two weeks will provide a good estimate (the two
             week total must be multiplied by two).
        •    Make estimates, when necessary, for any remaining expense categories. For example,
             most people spend money on “gifts” but it may be that in the particular month when
             you did the tracking exercise, there were no celebrations. However, keep in mind
             that most guesses tend to be lower than actual expenditures.
        •    Add your own speci c categories if you have expenses that are not contained in a
             typical budget. For example, you may engage in a specialized hobby, take lessons
             for a certain sport or play an instrument.
Create a Budget:
The rst time you put a budget together, plan on allotting a
fair amount of time to make sure that you do the advance
work necessary. You may be tempted to skip certain steps,
such as tracking your monthly expenditures or doing
the math to convert periodic expenditures to monthly
ones. However, if you guess and just ll in the blanks
with estimates, your budget will not be accurate. Without
knowing your genuine nancial situation, you will not be
able to develop a nancial plan that has any connection to
reality.

Once you have completed your budget, future changes only need to
be made when there is a change in your income or expenses. For example, if you pay o a
car loan, you can eliminate that expense from your budget. Or once you get a full-time job
after graduation, you can adjust the entry in the “income” line by replacing your parents’
allowance with a salary. Because a budget is a living document, many people choose to ll
it out in pencil. This allows for easy changes by just erasing the previous entry. All budgets
have these components in common:

        •    Write down your monthly take-home pay – the amount that you receive from your
             paycheck after any deductions are taken out. List income you receive from any
             source, such as a part-time job, gifts, investment income, or allowance from a parent.
             Add the entries to determine your total take-home or net income3 for that month.
        •    List how much you deposit in savings each month from your take-home income,
             even if it is only a small amount. If you do not currently set aside any savings, you
             need to get in the habit of paying yourself rst. This concept is addressed in Chapter
             7.
        •    List your “ xed” monthly expenses – the predictable, set amounts for the items and
             services that you pay for each month – like rent, car payment, or Internet access.
        •    List your “variable” monthly expenses – the amounts that uctuate, as well as the
             expenses you pay weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or once a year. These

Your Money, Your Future

         may include groceries, clothing, haircuts, tuition fees, textbooks, and gas and
         electricity. You will need to enter your average monthly amount for each expense.
         If you completed the advance preparation work, you should already have these
         numbers.
     •   List monthly estimates for “occasional” expenses – such as birthday and wedding
         gifts, or holiday gifts and sporting matches.
     •   Total your income and total your expenses. Compare the relationship between the
         two.
     •   Evaluate your outcome. If you have money left over after subtracting your expenses
         from your income and putting money in savings, you can carry over the balance for
         the next month or use it to pay unexpected expenses. If this month’s cash balance is
         negative, look for ways to cut back on the variable expenses.

Step 2: Review Your Progress

In some cases, your targeted spending plan and your actual spending habits do not coincide.
The goal is to spend according to the plan, but in reality many things may interfere with
our ability to stay within the budget constraints. Common categories in which you might
overspend may include meals out, clothing, entertainment, and mobile phone costs.

Since money management is a continual learning experience, it is necessary to keep records
of actual spending each month to compare with the plan. This comparison will allow you to:
    • Have an actual tally of how much you spent as opposed to estimates.
     •   Identify problem areas where overspending occurred.
     •   Reduce or eliminate some expenses.
     •   Brainstorm ways to increase income, such as nding a better paying job.

Step 3: Make Changes

This step requires adjusting expenses and/or income to reach your long-term nancial
goals, and is usually the most di cult. Many people, when asked to give things up or reduce
spending, tend to resist and come up with all kinds of excuses that start with “Yes, but...”
    • Common excuses include:
         -    I would give up my mobile phone, but what if there is an emergency?
         -    I would give up smoking, but then I will gain weight.
         -    I would give up eating out, but I do not have time to cook.
         -    I would give up entertainment, but then I will not have a social life.


The reality is that there are only two ways to improve your nancial situation — either
make more money or spend less (or do both). However, many people feel there is another




Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 2: Creating and Managing a Budget        16
solution. This solution is appealing since it does not involve sacri ces. It is not a proactive
solution, but one that relies on someone or something else saving the day:
    • You are waiting to marry into a wealthy family.
     •   You are waiting for your own family to help you out.
     •   You are waiting to get a good paying job.
     •   You are waiting to inherit money.
The problem with all these “solutions” is that they may or may not ever happen. Even if your
family does decide to help you out nancially, you will never learn to be truly independent
if you continue to request their assistance.

Being nancially independent is liberating; you are in control of your own nancial destiny
and do not have to rely on anyone else. This can also be frightening since you may fail.

However, there have been studies that prove a positive correlation between education in
personal nance and resultant behavior. Those with education tend to make wiser decisions
regarding their money.

So, the incentive to creating and following a budget is to increase your nancial prosperity.
The goal should be to end up with more money successes and fewer money messes.

                         Chapter 2 - Activity 1
                                   Where Does Your Money Go?

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, understanding how to create a budget is an
important way to organize and understand your nancial situation. If you do not yet earn
an income, work through this chapter with your parents using income and expense gures
that mirror your family’s actual budget.

Creating a budget is a great way to avoid feeling nancially overwhelmed or disorganized.
Not only will you feel more comfortable with your nancial situation, but you will have
more exibility to make nancial decisions to help you reach your goals. Even if you have
never had a budget before, it is not too late to learn how to budget your money.

Use the following activity to evaluate your own budgeting skills. Start to consider where you
spend most of your money and the bene ts of these expenses. Your answers will help you
formulate a basic spending plan. Your answers will also be helpful in the next activity, where
you will examine your own expenses in relation to recommended budgeting guidelines.

     1. Enter your estimated monthly income from all sources on the lines indicated below.
        Even if you do not yet have a formal job, you can still estimate the amount of
        discretionary money you receive from your parents. If you have additional sources of
        income, add them on the blank lines. Then, total your income in the space provided.

                                 Income                              Monthly Amount

     Sample Income                                                       350 dinars

     Family/Parents

     Job




                                               Total Income

     2. Next, estimate the amount of money you spend each month on food, housing,
        transportation, and other expenses, especially as they relate to the goals you
        set for yourself in Activity 2 from Chapter 1. Enter the amounts on the lines
        indicated on the next page. If you have additional expenses, add them on
        the blank lines. Then, total your monthly expenses in the space provided.

         Also identify the relative importance of each expense: is it very important,
         somewhat important, nice to have/do, or not very important? Classifying your
         expenses this way will help you determine where you might be able to cut back.

     3. Calculate how much money you have left over every month. Simply subtract
        your expenses from your income to determine this amount. If your expenses
        are greater than your income, then you need to look for ways to cut back.

                                             Total Income

                                      Minus Total Expenses -

Take It Another Step
Keep track of your actual income and expenses over a one-month period. Save any paystubs,
receipts, and bills, and then compare the total monthly amounts with your answers in Steps
1 and 2, above.

Did any of the di erences in estimated vs. actual expenses / income surprise you? What
changes in your behavior need to take place as a result?

                                            Budgeting Guidelines

Everyone has his or her own preferences about where to spend money. You may wish
to spend your money on education or entertainment, or you may just want to save your
money so that you can pursue your long-term goals. No matter how you choose to spend
your money, issues may arise when you spend more money than you have. Doing so creates
debt, which may not be the nancial situation in which you wanted to nd yourself.

This activity will help you look at your spending and determine how to make adjustments
to better align with your nancial priorities. Follow the steps below to compare your own
spending with the recommended amounts for a university student.

     1. Fill in the rst column with the amounts you tracked in Activity 1. These should be
        the actual dinar amounts you spent over one month.
     2. Calculate the percentage of your total monthly income that each amount represents.
        Enter these percentages in the second column.
     3. Look at the recommended percentage breakdown for student budgets in the third
        column. What is your initial reaction to these percentages? What surprised you?
     4. Compare your actual spending with the recommended spending percentages. In
        the last column, write “more” if you spend more than the percentage indicated in the
        recommended budget, or “less” if you spend less than the recommended amount.

                                  Actual             Actual     Recommended     More or

                                    Prepare for the Unexpected

Your budget is a exible document; your income and expenses might vary from month
to month and your priorities might change. Sometimes, you might face an unexpected
expense and need to make sacri ces in other areas of your spending in order to pay for it.
Thus, it is important to know how to work with and adjust your budget.

Consider how you would react to the following scenarios, based on the spending plan you
developed in the previous two activities. This activity focuses on adjusting your budget based
on di erent scenarios that could come up and cause unexpected spending. Think about the
following ctional situations. How would you react to them? What nancial decisions would
you make? What might you have to give up in order to pay for these expenses?

    Situation 1: You drive to work everyday, 10 kilometers each way, and you have the exact
    amount of money budgeted for petrol for the month, based on last week’s price of 5
    dinars per gallon. Unexpectedly, the price of petrol increases by 20%. What will you do
    to pay the extra cost for petrol?
        Added expense amount per month: __________________
        Your course of action (activities and expenses to cut back):
     ________________________________________________________________

    Situation 2: As a clerk at a store in your neighborhood, you make 70 dinars per week.
    Today you found out that the store is going out of business. How will this drop in income
    a ect your overall budget? Will you nd another source of income? Will you ask your
    parents for more money? Or will you cut back in certain areas?
        Decreased income amount per month: __________________

    Situation 3: A friend asks you to go away for a weekend to celebrate his birthday.
    Although you had not planned on spending any more money this month, you really
    want to go on the trip. With transportation, hotel, food, and entertainment costs, the
    trip will likely cost 100 or more dinars. Will you go on the trip? How will you pay for it?
    What might you give up in order to make the trip?

Re ect on past experiences and anticipate future issues. If you think about di erent
situations that caused a budget adjustment in the past, you may have a better idea of what
could happen in the future. What did you do in the past when unexpected expenses came
up? Did you have an organized budget then? How will you use what you learned in the past
to anticipate future budget changes?

Many readers of this Guide aspire to achieve a tertiary education. A student loan is a tool
that may allow a student to a ord the costs of tertiary education. A loan connected to the
advancement of your education is an investment in your future. With a higher education

The importance of tertiary education is a tenet that is agreed upon throughout the world.

to pass a placement exam, or the inability nancially to a ord continued education.

The increased number of private institutions and rising tuition costs have prompted more
students to look at student loans as one option to help fund their tertiary education. It
is becoming increasingly common for students and their parents to consider borrowing
money as a necessary higher education nancing tool if they lack the resources to pay
all or a part of these education costs. To meet this need, more banks and micro- credit
organizations have been moving to diversify their product line to include student loans.

In simple terms, a loan is an arrangement in which a lender gives money to a borrower and
the borrower agrees to repay the money at some future point in time. In the case of student
loans, the money is to be used to help pay the cost of tuition. Chapters 4 – 6 discuss debt
more in depth.

For this service, the lender receives a fee from the borrower for the use of the borrowed
money, which is gathered primarily through interest payments. An interest rate is often

Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 3: Student Loans                    24
expressed as an annual percentage of the original amount
borrowed. As money is not free, interest represents the
cost to the borrower of using the lender’s money.

Determine How Much to Borrow
The following steps will help you determine exactly
how much money you will need to borrow for school.
Knowing the correct amount will prevent you from
borrowing too little or too much. Coming up short
creates an obvious problem but borrowing too much
will result in additional and unnecessary debt that will
eventually have to be repaid.

Step 1: Identify Your Educational Expenses

Work with your tertiary education institution’s admissions or student services o ce to
identify all expected costs. These expenses may include, but are not necessarily limited to
the following:
    • Tuition
     •   Fees (e.g., registration, permits, etc.)
     •   Housing
     •   Meals
     •   Transport / Parking
     •   Textbooks and supplies
     •   Special equipment (e.g., computer)

Step 2: Evaluate Your Existing Financial Resources

Because the total cost of borrowing can increase signi cantly as each year of schooling
passes, a good strategy is to borrow only what is absolutely necessary. Evaluate non-loan
sources rst to pay for many of your educational expenses. Then determine how much
might be available and over what time period you can rely on the various sources.

Identifying alternative sources of non-loan funding is also important since most student
loans only cover the cost of tuition. The other costs associated with an education must be
paid for in a di erent way. These sources of funding may include:

     •   Gifts from your immediate family or relatives
     •   Current family income
     •   Savings
     •   Investments



Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 3: Student Loans                            25
        •    Income during the school year
        •    Scholarships / awards

Step 3: Calculate Funding Needed

Total Educational Expenses – Total Funding Available = Amount to Borrow

Once this amount is determined, you will need to shop around to nd a student loan with the
best terms. Lenders will list their “terms and conditions” – see Chapter 4 for more information
on “terms and conditions.” Compare loans among the various lenders to determine which
has the most favorable terms for your particular situation. Common questions to ask may
include:

        •    What is the interest rate (the lower the better)?
        •    Is the interest rate xed or adjustable?
        •    Are payments required while still in school?
        •    Is the total balance due upon graduation?
        •    If not, is there a grace period4 after graduation before payments begin (e.g., six
             months)?
        •    How will the principal be repaid (e.g., equal monthly sums)?
        •    What are the criteria for approving the loan?
        •    Are there any special fees associated with the loan (e.g., processing charge, late fee)?
        •    Do you have any repayment options if you get behind on payments?


Since this loan will be a sizable investment in your future, you should take the time to
 nd answers to all of these questions. Only when you understand the full extent of your
commitment, should you enter into this long-term obligation.

Also, discuss the possibility of obtaining a student loan with your family. Revisit the budget
exercises discussed in Chapter 2 to see how this student loan would t into your family’s
budget.

                            How Will You Spend your Money?

Chances are that you are reading this because you are about to enter your next life stage
— one that includes the next phase of your education. This chapter has focused on student
loans as a way to help increase your understanding of your options for nancing your post-
secondary education.

This activity will build on the foundation that you started with the previous chapter, in
which you identi ed and analyzed your nancial decisions and activities. In fact, it is a good
idea to get your work from that activity, so you can refer to it easily.

Follow the steps below to help you think about your expected nancial decisions and
activities as a university student.

    1. List the nancial activities and decisions you might encounter as a university
       student. Some may happen daily (e.g., meals, cell phone charges), while some may
       happen only once per semester (e.g., tuition, textbooks). Even if you are unsure
       about it, go ahead and list it. Do not worry about organizing your list at this point.

         ________________________________             ________________________________


    2. Organize your list. Now, look at your list and group the nancial activities and
       decisions, similar to the example below. Create di erent groupings, such as:
         •   Likelihood of the activity or decision occurring — Is it de nite, probable, or
             merely possible?
         •   Relative size of the activity/decision — Is it a minor spending decision/activity?
             Is it a major one?
         •   Frequency of the activity/decision — Which ones are you likely to experience
             daily or weekly? Which ones are monthly or less often?
         •   Necessity of spending — Is there some spending that you will have to do? Some
             that you think you will choose to do?

     3. Look for patterns and di erences. Do you notice any patterns within the likelihood
        category? Di erences? Are there some activities that are dependent on others?


Take It Another Step
Talk with a current university student. Ask someone you know who is currently enrolled
in university (or recently graduated) about some unexpected nancial decisions and
responsibilities. What were they? How did they handle the situations? What did they learn
from the experiences?

                               Paying for your Education

In the previous activity, you identi ed some of the nancial activities and decisions you may
face in university. Now, you will calculate the total of those activities and determine how
much funding you will need in order to pay for university.

    1. Add up all of your expected expenses. In the chart below, write down each of the
        nancial activities that you identi ed in the previous activity. Then, estimate the
       yearly cost for each. Add all of the estimated costs to come up with a yearly total of
       educational expenses.

   Total Educational Expenses


    2. Calculate the funding you will need to attend university. Using the example
       chart below, enter your total educational expenses (from Step 1). Then subtract
       your existing nancial resources to determine the additional money you may
       need to borrow in order to pay for your education. Remember this formula:

         Total Educational Expenses – Total Funding Available = Amount to Borrow

Some student nancing programs may limit the amount that a student or family may
borrow per year. Therefore, it will be important to discuss the nancing options available to
you with your local nancial institutions.

                               Ask the Right Questions

Deciding how to pay for university is not always an easy process. University and the expenses
that come along with it can be expensive, but there are options available for those who
are focused on the goal of continuing their education. Now that you know what nancial
activities and decisions you might face in university and the amount of funding you will
likely need, you can research your nancing options with a clearer picture.

One of the best ways to gain insight about student loans is to begin by asking questions.

Determine what you already know about student loans and areas for which you need
additional information by following the steps below. Remember that many of your questions
may be answered throughout this Guide.

     1. Make a list of all the things you already know about student loans. This list may
        include potential lenders, information about the application process, interest (or mark-
        up) rates on student loans, repayment terms, and factors that in uence the amount of
        your loan.
        Community Bank A has low mark-up rates.




     2. Write down all the remaining questions you have about student loans. Maybe
        you are wondering what type of documentation to provide or how the
        lender works with your chosen university? Knowing which questions to ask a
        potential lender will prepare you to gain the most relevant information possible.
        How long will it take to pay back my loan?




       Keep the above questions in mind as you continue through this curriculum. The goal
       is to have a better understanding of how student loans work and how they will be able
       to help you with the costs of higher education.

  Establishing Credit

                                  Chapter 4:
                                   Establishing Credit

Credit involves the act of buying goods and services now and paying for them over time.
When you obtain credit, you are using borrowed money in lieu of your own. Credit is
usually granted through a loan or agreement with a creditor. A good way to understand
this concept is that it is similar to paying “rent.” Just as you would pay rent for the privilege
of living in someone else’s house, credit allows you to “rent” others’ money to buy goods and
services.

Debt on the other hand is created after money is lent. Debt refers to the amount owed from
the funds that are borrowed. There is a cause and e ect
relationship between the two—the granting of credit
creates debt.
                                                                 When you borrow

people nd hard to amass. In exchange, you receive
a valuable asset (i.e., your education, car, or home).

When you borrow money from a bank or other lender, you agree to pay it back. It is not a
gift. In return for this arrangement, you pay fees and / or interest (commonly called mark-
up), as well as the money you have initially borrowed (the principal). You are o ered credit
because people trust you to repay them within a predetermined period of time.

Credit can be an essential nancial management tool. Using credit gives you exibility to
make purchases when you need them the most, not just when you have the cash to pay for
them.

This is both advantageous and disadvantageous. On the positive side, you will have
immediate grati cation and need not wait until you have accumulated the money. On the
negative side, this may facilitate overspending; it is always easier to spend other people’s
money. Regardless, establishing credit is the rst step toward ensuring strong, long-term
 nancial health.

Types of Credit
There are many di erent types of credit including home mortgages5, car loans, small
business loans, student loans, and credit cards. To decipher the language of credit, some
helpful translations are listed below:

Installment Loan: This is a credit account where you pay back a set amount every month for
a period of time. Cars, student loans, and mortgages are all examples of installment loans.

Unsecured vs. Secured: A secured debt is one that is linked to an asset, such as a home or
an automobile. An unsecured debt is one that does not have an asset attached, such as a
credit card.

In case of nonpayment of the loan, the creditor may take back the asset linked to a secured
debt. Examples include foreclosure6 or automobile repossession.7 For unsecured debts,
since there is no property to be seized, the creditors have to rely upon other methods to
recoup the money lent (see Chapter 6).

Credit and Debit Cards: In many countries, the use of debit cards or cash has far surpassed
that of credit cards. Credit cards have only recently emerged as an alternative form of
payment. For most university students, credit cards are very di cult to obtain since they do
not have a guaranteed job yet. Those students who do possess a credit card have usually
obtained it because their parents have the nancial means to back the extension of credit.

Credit and debit cards look similar but there is a signi cant di erence
between the two forms of payment.

      •    Debit Card: A card that is tied to your bank account.
           When you make a purchase with this card, the money is
           automatically withdrawn from your bank account. This
           is not a form of credit.


      •    Credit Card: A credit account that allows consumers to
           make purchases up to a pre-determined amount (i.e.,
           credit limit) and pay back what is borrowed, plus interest or
           mark-up. These payments may be partial.
You can continue to use a credit card as long as you do not go over your credit limit. While
some payment is required each month, you do not have to pay o the entire balance.
However, it is important to always pay your credit card bill on time. If you miss a payment,
the credit card company may charge you late fees. These fees can compound over time and
be a very expensive way to purchase goods.


5
  Mortgage: An installment loan you use to pay for eventual ownership of an apartment or house. A lien is placed on the property until you pay
o the loan according to its terms and schedule.
6
  Foreclosure:The legal process by which an owner’s right to a property is terminated, usually due to default.Typically involves a forced sale of the
property at a public auction, with the proceeds being applied to the mortgage debt.
7
  Repossession: The taking back of a borrower’s automobile by the lender, usually due to loan default.

Chapter 4: Establishing Credit                                          34
Remember, having a credit card means that the credit card company has agreed to lend
you money. You are required to pay that money back, usually with interest added, for the
convenience of borrowing those funds. It is not free money. (See Chapter 6)

There is yet another type of card, which resembles a credit card but has a di erent payment
structure:
    • Charge Card: A credit account in which you are required to pay the entire balance
        you spend at the end of each month.
For example, if you spend 1,000 dinars, you are required to pay the entire 1,000 dinars when
you receive your bill.

Even though there are only two main types of cards that o er you credit, every card is
di erent in the credit limit, interest rate, and other fees and terms. Always review credit
card agreements carefully before applying for and using a card, and look at your statements
closely each month to make sure you understand all the charges.

Terms and Conditions
When you enter into a credit arrangement, you will have to sign a contract that contains
all the terms8 and conditions of the loan. If you understand the terminology, including the
vocabulary listed below, you will fully comprehend the nature of your agreement.

Finance Charges: The amount of interest / mark-up and other fees (e.g., transaction fees, late
fees, etc.) that you are charged from your creditor each month.

Some of the most common nance charges are:
   • Transaction Fees: Transaction fees are sometimes assessed when you transfer a
      balance from one credit card to another or when you use an ATM to withdraw money
      from a bank that is not your own. Withdrawals from ATMs in foreign countries are
      usually charged a higher transaction fee than from ATMs in your home country.
        •    Annual Fee: Sometimes a company will charge you a fee just for using its services.
             This fee will usually appear on your statement once a year. For credit cards, you may
             be required to pay this fee even if you never use the card for any purchases. Since
             many cards have no annual fee, it is worthwhile to shop around.
        •    Cash Advance Fee: This is a fee linked to a credit card for withdrawing money directly
             from the card, instead of using the card to make a purchase of goods or services. The
             fee charged for this transaction is usually higher than for a straight purchase.
        •    Over-the-Limit Fee: This is a fee charged if you go over your credit limit. Be aware
             that your purchase may be approved even if you are over the limit. So it is important
             to always know your outstanding balance and if you are close to the limit before you
             make a purchase.
        •    Late Payment Fee: This is a fee charged if a payment is received after the due date.
             Missing even a few payment deadlines could cause your interest rate to increase.

    Terms: Your agreement with your creditor that speci es how often you will make payments on an account and for how long.

      •    APR: The term APR, or annual percentage rate, refers to the total amount of interest /
           mark-up and fees you are required to pay per year on a credit account. Your APR may
           change while you have your account if it is a variable rate and not a xed rate. The
           higher the interest rate or mark-up, the more money you will have to repay in total
           on the loan. APR is calculated and expressed in terms of percentages.
                                 For example, if your loan has a 10% APR rate, you will pay 10 dinars per
                                     every 100 dinars you borrow annually. To calculate your monthly
                                        rate you simply divide your annual percentage rate by 12. For
                                          example:
If your loan has a 10%
APR rate, you will pay                            18% divided by 12 equals 1.5%.
  10 dinars per every
                                                If 200 dinars is your account balance then 200 x 1.5% = 3
100 dinars you borrow                           dinars. This is the monthly cost of credit. That may not sound
       annually.                               like a lot, but it can de nitely add up! The most important
                                             lesson to remember is this – the time you spend shopping
                                           around for the best rate is well worth the savings you will gain
                                       in the long run.


Qualifying for Credit
Some countries are beginning to adopt “credit reports9,” which assist creditors in deciding
whether to o er credit to a customer. Local credit reporting companies in addition to
government agencies are in the early development stages of these reports. Although the
use of credit reports is not yet widespread, creditors can use other methods to determine
whether a customer is creditworthy.

Banks normally operate on the premise of “Know Your Customer.” You can start to build a
relationship with a bank by opening a small savings or current account. Then as the bank
gets to know you, your credibility will slowly become established. The more credibility you
have, the more nancing options are available to you.

Your payment history (whether detailed on a credit report or developed through a
relationship with a bank) will be a powerful determining factor as to whether you receive
credit and what interest rate or mark-up you will be charged. Thus, it is important to maintain
excellent credit management. This is the subject of the next chapter.




9
 Credit report: A report containing detailed information on a person’s credit history, which includes identifying information, credit accounts and
payment history. It can be obtained by prospective lenders with the borrower’s permission, to determine his or her creditworthiness.

each month or buy only things you know you can pay o in one month? What will you
have to give up if you take on a loan payment? Will a bank o er you good credit products
with your nancial history? These are the types of questions you should ask yourself when
considering whether to apply for credit. And they are the same types of questions that a
bank will consider before o ering you a loan or a credit card.

Banks extend credit to consumers who exhibit good credit behaviors. And the better their
behaviors, the better credit products the bank can o er. Take mark-up rates, for example.
Consumers with “good credit” often qualify for lower mark-up rates. And that means lower
monthly payments and lower overall costs paid to the bank. See the following example for
a demonstration of how much money you can “save” by establishing and maintaining good
credit:

                                     Managing Debt

After you have applied for and received credit, you need to act in a responsible and prudent
manner to ensure that this credit is not misused. When you accept a contract with a creditor,
you enter into a relationship in which you must meet certain obligations. Credit is not your
money, nor is it a gift. It is a responsibility that needs to be taken very seriously.

This chapter will examine certain tactics that will help you use credit wisely. In general, debt
management strategies can be used to:
    • Avoid the overuse of credit
    •    Reduce the total amount of debt
    •    Shorten the repayment time
                                                                      Debt management
                                                                       strategies will be

These strategies will be particularly important when you get
your rst job after university and become solely responsible for
your student loan. However, you should discuss these strategies in
depth with your family as soon as you begin to consider a student loan. Incurring any type
of debt will a ect your parents’ budget and the implications should be considered carefully.

Through commitment and adherence to each recommendation, you will become a better
money manager. In the course of your exploration, you may nd that certain tactics are very
easy to follow, whereas others are more di cult. Concentrate on those strategies that you
are not already implementing. Practice following the advice given, even if it is di cult, and
you will soon notice your unhealthy money habits being replaced by more bene cial ones.

Student Loan Debt:
Depending upon the terms and conditions of the student loan, the repayment may start
while in school or shortly after graduation. Either way you must categorize this monthly
amount as a need and not as a want in your budget. It should always be paid before any
discretionary spending takes place. If you have a shortage and nd it di cult to make this
payment, it may require reducing or eliminating other expenses.

For those student loans with a grace period, you will have a reprieve before payments come
due. However, do not forget to add this upcoming expense to your post-graduation budget.
Making nancial plans that do not include this regular payment will result in budgets that
underestimate your total expenses. Believing your expenses to be less than they actually
are, can result in nancial decisions that do not re ect the reality of your nancial means.

                             For example, you may select an apartment that is more expensive
                               than you can a ord. This mistake could have been avoided if you
                                 had taken your student loan payments into consideration.

                                   If you received student loans from various sources, you may
                                   want to stagger the due dates so that all the payments are not
                                   due at the same time each month. Spreading out the due dates
                                  may assist in managing your cash ow. Certain student loans
                                 may also allow you to consolidate them. This would result in one
                              payment per month instead of several and it may also lower the
                           interest rate.

Decide Between Cash and Credit:
Buying on credit nearly always costs more than buying the same item with cash. It is a
good idea to get into the habit of asking yourself these questions every time you consider
purchasing something on credit:
   1. Is this something I need?
    2.    If so, do I need it now or can I wait?
    3.    Can I qualify for credit?
    4.    What is the interest rate or mark-up?
    5.    Are there additional fees?
    6.    How long is the tenor and the grace period?
    7.    How much is the monthly payment?
    8.    When is the monthly payment due?
    9.    Can I a ord to pay the monthly payments?
    10. How long will it take me to repay the amount borrowed?
    11. What will happen if I do not make the payments on time?
    12. What is the extra cost of using credit (OR) how much will it ultimately cost me?
    13. What will I have to give up if I buy it? What is the opportunity cost?


Your answers to these preceding questions will guide your answer to this nal question:
“All things considered, is using credit worth it?”

Pay Cash for Living Expenses:
Do not depend heavily on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses. If you nd yourself
using credit to pay for groceries, gasoline, meals out, personal hygiene items or clothes, try
to pay with cash instead. Some people nd they are using credit for these items because
they do not have the available cash. This is often a warning sign of being overextended.

Chapter 5: Managing Debt                           43
Use Credit for Items of Lasting Value:
Credit is best used for items whose value will outlast the installment payments. If you
purchase furniture on credit, for example, will you still be paying for that couch long after
it has fallen apart? What about that meal you ate long before you received the credit card
bill? Psychologically it is more di cult to pay for something that you no longer have in your
possession.

Understand Statements:
Check every billing statement for correct information, including purchases, any credit
reversals, and payments. Act quickly to correct errors, such as double payments, under-
reported payments, or in ated purchase amounts. If there is an honest accounting error,
the creditor should easily be able to revise your account. Keeping receipts will assist in
presenting your case.

Think Ahead:
Be proactive, not reactive, about your nances. Make a plan that includes your di erent
  nancial obligations after graduation. You want to endeavor to be in control of your money
and not have your money control you. By being in control, you can make the decisions that
you want to make and not have decisions thrust upon you. For example, if you have money
in a savings account, you may be able to take more time nding a job that you really want
and not be forced to take the rst job that is o ered to you – just because you need the
money.

Live Within Your Means:
Do not open new credit accounts unless they t with your overall budget plan. Remember
that numbers do not lie, so if your expenses are as much as – or more than – your disposable
income, taking on another loan will de nitely not help you solve your cash ow problems
(See Chapter 2).

Resist Impulse Buying:
Major purchases should never be made without rst doing
comparison shopping and then making sure that your budget
will allow for the purchase. Impulse buying occurs when
your emotions are allowed to supplant your logic. Many      To gure out your

greater, you are in the danger zone and need to work on reducing your debt level. You are
in great shape if your debt percentage is 15% or lower. (See Chapter 5, Activity 2)

Make Payments on Time:
Consequences of missing the due date may include higher interest rates as a penalty
and late fees until your account is brought up-to-date. Notify creditors when you move
so that your bills arrive on time and your payments are never late. If your loan’s due date
is approaching and you have not received a statement, call the customer service number
located on your credit card or previous billing statement. Not receiving the bill is not a valid
excuse for not paying.

Credit Card Debt:
Credit card usage has been increasing among adults and is projected to increase even
more in the future. Therefore, in anticipation that credit cards will become a part of your
 nancial portfolio as you enter the job market, you need to learn the basics of credit card
management prior to your actual receipt of them. Preventative
education is the best way to avoid credit mistakes in the
future:
    • Try to restrict your total number of credit
        cards to only one.
    •    Pay the entire balance when it is due;
         resist making only a partial payment.
    •    Review your spending habits by
         analyzing your bill. Identify unnecessary
         purchases and make an e ort to cut
         them out in the future.
    •    Set a monthly limit for your total charges
         and stick to it.
    •    Do not charge your credit cards to the maximum
         limit and keep them at that level.
    •    Pay your bill as soon as you get it. Depending on how the interest rates are
         calculated, each extra day could result in additional interest charges.
    •    Never lend credit cards to friends or leave cards or receipts lying around where
         people can nd them.
    •    Keep a list of your credit card account numbers and creditors’ phone numbers in
         a safe place in case a card is lost or stolen. If this happens, report it as soon as you
         notice it is missing.
    •    Do not pay just the minimum amount due. Paying more than the minimum
         will save you much more money over time. The next chapter has an example
         illustrating this.

Chapter 5: Managing Debt                        45
Debt Consolidation Loans:
Consolidating your loans may encourage borrowing more than is absolutely necessary. If
you elect a consolidation loan for an amount that exceeds what you owe on the accounts to
be consolidated, you will end up with more debt than before. However, a debt consolidation
approach can be smart if you move your debt to a lower interest loan and do not incur
additional debt. Consider this example:

Family A and Family B both owe 14,000 dinars in total debt on multiple accounts at an
interest / mark-up rate of 18 percent. They would like to become debt free. By getting a debt
consolidation loan at a 10 percent interest rate, they could lower their monthly payment
signi cantly.

Family A borrows only the amount needed to pay o their existing debt and then closes
all their accounts. Family B gets a loan for 6,000 dinars more than they need and then they
continue to use their lines of credit, eventually bringing them back up to their initial level of
14,000 dinars. Notice the di erence in ending debt levels:

                                Family A                 Family B
Debt consolidation loan         14,000 (10%)             20,000 (10%)
New debt                        0                        14,000 (18%)
Ending debt                     14,000 (10%)             34,000 (14%*)
* 14% computed based on the average interest rate of both loans combined

Debt consolidation loans can be a good idea if, like Family A, you only borrow the amount
equal to the existing debt and then close the existing credit accounts in order to avoid the
temptation to continue using credit. By making the wrong choices, Family B has made their
debt situation worse than when they started.

Do people go shopping with the intent of going into debt? Do they spend more money
than they have because they want to be in debt? Probably not! There are many di erent
reasons why people go into debt -- some are avoidable and some are not. Some are

them according to the likely levels of
debt, timeframes for the debt, and whether the debt is avoidable or unavoidable. Finally,
decide what you think each person should do in the given situation. There may not be a
“right” or “wrong” answer; it is important to examine the bene ts and opportunity costs for
both sides of the issue.


Scenario 1: Eric took out a student loan to pay for university. Although he originally wanted
a career in nance, he has been thinking recently about attending business school after
graduation to give him broader career options. He would have to take on additional debt to
do so. Alternatively, he could go to work for his uncle at an investment rm after graduation.

Talk with family members about their experiences with debt. Did they weigh the bene ts
and opportunity costs before going into debt? How did they manage their debt? Knowing
what they know now, would they have done anything di erently? Learning about family
members’ experiences can help prepare for your own decisions about going into debt.

                              Managing your Debt Level

Have you already encountered situations where it was necessary to go into debt? As you
get older, it becomes more likely that you will go into debt to reach a long-term goal or even
to pay for an unexpected expense. Whatever the reason, it is important to remember that
managing your debt and paying it back in a timely manner are responsibilities that come
with taking on the debt in the rst place.

The amount of debt you carry in relation to your income – that is, your debt-to-income
ratio – also becomes an important consideration in your overall money management.
(Earlier in the chapter, you learned to divide your total monthly debt payments by your
monthly gross income to come up with this ratio.) Review the chart below, which examines
di erent debt-to-income ratios and how they can a ect one’s personal nancial situation.

It is important to note that di erent cultures around the world will have di erent tolerances
for levels of personal debt. The chart below re ects a US norm, which may well not be
appropriate for all national contexts.




                                                                                Source: Citi
Now, you will look at the debt levels of the individuals from the previous activity to
determine where they fall on this spectrum – both currently and in the future if they take on
the additional debt. Referencing the chart above, ll in the debt categories for their current
and potential future debt percentages. Does this change the decision you made about the
individual in the last activity? If you would change your decision, describe what you would
do di erently and why.

Calculate your own level of debt. As a student, you may not yet have debt obligations. If
that is the case, ll out this exercise with your parents, using the debt obligations of your
parents. If you family has not yet incurred debt, think of potential types of debt that you
may one day incur. Start by lling in each of your regular debt obligations (i.e., loans, credit
card bills, and other debts) in the chart on the next page.

                                                    Repaying Debt

This nancial literacy Guide has already covered the rst two stages in the credit continuum.
The last stage is repaying your debt.

                             Establishing                




                                                            Maintaining

When you enter into any loan agreement, it comes with a responsibility to pay it back.
Similarly, by signing an agreement for education funding, you will be required to make
regular payments during your period of study with the balance due after graduation. Your
repayment amount should be a xed item in your budget. You need to allocate enough
money each month to make sure that this payment is made consistently and on-time. It is
important to remember that this loan was at least partially responsible for
your attainment of a higher education.

Some lenders allow a grace period after graduation before you           You will need to
must start making regular payments. A common grace period is            have a clear plan
six months – meaning that after the sixth month following your
graduation, you will have to start making monthly payments. Your
                                                                         for repayment.
“after graduation” spending plan should not neglect to include this
expense. Even though this payment will not start immediately upon
graduation, it will soon come active so you need to budget for it. You will
need to have a clear plan for repayment based on the schedule of debt for your loan as
there may be cycles where the debt repayment sum is higher and then tapers o . Be certain
to speak to your bank to understand the speci c aspects of how your repayment will work
during and after graduation.

Most people do not encounter any problems in handling this monthly expense and
you should not anticipate any problems either. However if, at any time, you experience
di culty in repaying the loan, it is important to contact the lender to work out an alternate
arrangement. Some of the outcomes of defaulting10 on your student loans may include:

     •    No additional nancial aid
     •    The entire loan may become due in full.
     •    Collection costs may be added.
     •    Tax lien11
     •    Paycheck garnishments12
The actual consequences depend on the discretion of your local bank / creditor. Since
di erent institutions have varying procedures for dealing with default, it is important to
 nd out the process for your institution of choice.
10
   Defaulting: Failing to make a payment on a loan as agreed in the loan’s terms.
11
   Tax lien: A claim on property by the government to secure payment of taxes owed.
12
   Garnishment: When an amount is withheld from your paycheck.

                             Repayment Di culties
                              Many young adults behave like ostriches when they
                                encounter nancial problems, by hiding their heads in the
                                 sand. If they ignore the problem, they think it does not
                                  exist. Sometimes the problem seems so overwhelming or
                                  insurmountable that denial becomes the most attractive
                                  solution. We tend to believe that if we ignore unpleasant
                                  news, then our problems will just go away. But avoidance
                                 of debt problems only works in the short run; you
                                eventually must confront the issue.

                            Step 1: Admitting the Problem to Yourself
                        The rst step to nding a solution to any debt problem is to
overcome any self-imposed barriers you have erected that would prevent you from getting
or receiving help. These psychological barriers sometimes cause people to believe their
 nancial situation is hopeless because they:
    • Are not good with numbers
     •   Were never taught about money
     •   Are paid on commission, with no steady salary
     •   Are unemployed
     •   Are too old / too young
All of these situations present challenges, but no nancial situation is ever hopeless. Sitting
back and doing nothing because you do not believe a solution exists will only guarantee
that your situation will never improve. However, being willing to admit to yourself that there
is a problem... is the rst step toward nding a solution.

Step 2: Admitting the Problem to Others
Your lenders will be more cooperative if you contact them before they contact you. Imagine
a hypothetical situation where you lent money to a cousin. If your cousin runs into a
situation where he is unable to pay you back, you would probably prefer that he be honest
and explain his repayment problems.

However, people are often embarrassed when they are unable to pay back a loan so they
instead hide from their friends or family. When this happens, the person who has lent the
money feels angry and upset that his family member is not being responsive. If the debt
remains unpaid, the situation can cause irreparable damage to the relationship.

The same philosophy holds true for a bank-client relationship. It should be honored in the
same fashion as any personal loan. By contacting the bank, you will learn of alternative
arrangements that may enable you to continue making payments. These repayment
options may vary from bank to bank and are subject to availability.

Student Loan Repayment Options
In the case of student loans, the following are some of the options that may be available
to you. Depending on your individual situation and the options o ered by your local bank,
you may elect to choose one repayment option over the other. The rst two options will
link your payment to your income. This may make the payment easier to manage since the
amount will be calculated with your income in mind:

Income Sensitive:

    1. Graduated Repayment Schedule
       This repayment schedule assumes that borrowers should make more money as they
       progress in their careers. Payments are initially lower and then increase later in the
       repayment schedule.
    2. Income Sensitive Repayment
       The monthly payment amount will be established based on your gross monthly


Hardship Related:

When circumstances cause repayment to become di cult, sometimes a change in the
terms of the loan can solve the repayment challenge. For example, in the case of a change
in due date, if you fall behind because your student loan is due the same week as the rent
or mortgage, car payment or other signi cant bills, contact your lender to see whether you
can change the due date and thus stagger your bill payments.

It is important to contact your lender and be proactive. Ignoring
the situation will not make it go away; it usually only succeeds
in making the situation worse. Never make the assumption           It is important
that there is nothing your lender can do to help. This is
usually not the case.                                             to contact your
                                                                  lender and be
                                                                    proactive.

Repay Credit Card Debt

The previous chapter discussed ways to manage your credit obligations and avoid
unnecessary debt. However, despite knowing the rules of how to use credit wisely, some
people still nd themselves overextended. If one day you nd yourself overwhelmed with
credit card bills, follow these steps to get out of debt:

    1. Cease using your credit cards. Put them away in a safe place where you will not be
       tempted to use them.
    2. Do not apply for additional credit cards.
    3. Pay more than the minimum payment (even a small amount over the minimum
       reduces both the amount of interest paid on your debt and the time it will take to
       pay it o ). For example:

         If you owe US$2,500 dollars on combined credit card debt with an 18 percent APR,
         and only pay the minimum ($75 or 3% of the balance) every month until the entire
         amount is paid off, it will take almost 15 years. You will have paid US$2,300 in
         interest alone—almost the same amount as your original balance! However, if you add
         the following amounts every month to the minimum payments, look at the results:

  ADD TO MINIMUM           PAYOFF TIME (MO/YRS) TOTAL INTEREST PAID          INTEREST SAVINGS

              0                   180 /15                   2,300                     0

             10                    40/3.3                    822                   1,478

             25                    32/2.6                    657                   1,643

             50                     24/2                     495                   1,805


    4. Send in payments as soon as you receive the bill. (For every extra day you carry a
       balance, your interest charges may accumulate.)
    5. When one card is paid o , make the same payments on another; resist seeing the
       extra money as spending money.
    6. Refuse the credit card issuer’s o er to skip a monthly payment (zero owed that
       month).
    7. Consolidate cards. Make sure to cut up the cards with balances that are now zero or
       you may be tempted to use them again.
    8. Re nance high-rate credit cards. Shop around for the best interest rate.
    9. Consider using savings to pay o high-rate credit card balances, but only if you
       already have a three-to six-month emergency savings fund.

Credit handled wisely is a wonderful thing. The bene ts of having access to credit cards are
numerous. Conversely, not understanding credit cards and making unwise decisions can
a ect you negatively for years to come.

Repaying Other Debts
Other common loans include mortgages, automobile loans, small business, and personal
loans. All these loans come with an obligation to pay them back. Depending on the
discretion of the bank / lender, there are di erent consequences for nonpayment of these
loans.

Most commonly, if your bills are past-due13, the bank may immediately foreclose on the
collateral or call upon your guarantors. In the rst case, collateral refers to the item that the
loan is secured to. For example, in the case of an automobile loan, the vehicle
is the secured property. This means that non-payment of this type of
loan will initiate e orts to retrieve the vehicle by the creditor.

In the second case, your guarantor is the person who has agreed
to back your loan. Once the original recipient of the loan is
in default, the bank will contact the next in line (guarantor) to
attempt to get the loan current. Since the guarantors are equally
accountable for repayment of the loan, committing to be a
guarantor is a responsibility that should be taken seriously.

If you continue to avoid your creditor’s attempts to reach you, you can
expect to hear from a debt collector / collection agency. This is someone, other than the
creditor, who regularly collects debts owed to someone else. Lawyers who collect debts
on a regular basis are considered debt collectors, too. Normally these external agencies are
more di cult to work with than the original creditor. This is precisely why you should not
ignore the situation and allow your account to end up with a debt collector.

The best rule of thumb is to avoid taking on more debt than you can handle. However, if
you nd yourself needing loans to fund your lifestyle, you may be living above your means.
Go back to your budget (see Chapter 2) and nd areas where you can either reduce or
eliminate some expenses. Keeping your debt to a manageable level is the key to avoiding
repayment problems.

                              Create Your Own Financial Plans

How can you use everything you have learned to create your own nancial plan? You have set
goals and gained knowledge of available nancial options. You understand the importance of
a budget, how to establish credit, and what to do with regard to debt. This guide has created a
reference point — a foundation from which you can plan your nancial future.

So, start putting what you have learned to good use! In the activity below, you will create two
di erent scenarios for nancing your university education and repaying the debt after you
graduate.

Consider the following questions in coming up with your plans:
   1. Where will the majority of your university funding come from?

                                     Saving and its Bene ts

You will hopefully reach a point in your life when you earn enough money to meet your
basic life expenses and still have some left to either save or invest. As a student, this time
may seem far o . However, thinking about how you want to save money in the future will
help you meet your longer term goals.

When given the choice between saving and spending money, those who seek immediate
grati cation choose spending as the more desirable of the two options. Your purchase is
something tangible; you can enjoy it without delay. On the other hand, the bene ts of
saving are not realized until a later date – one must delay grati cation. For many people,
especially young adults, the concept of waiting until a later date is not as attractive as the
present moment. Why delay when you can have it now?

Unfortunately the mentality of “immediacy” does not lend itself to good saving or investing
behavior. Therefore, the rst step to starting a good saving habit is to understand why it is
worth the wait.

Each person is certain to experience unexpected “life events.” These result in the unexpected
expenses that are usually not accounted for in your budget. Life events run the spectrum
from everyday annoyances to major emergencies.

Sample life events:
   • Home repairs                                             Each person is
                                                          certain to experience
     •    Tra c tickets
                                                         unexpected “life events.”
     •    Auto accidents                                    These result in the
     •    Health issues or illness                      unexpected expenses that
     •    Birth of a child                              are usually not accounted
                                                            for in your budget.
     •    Technology repairs (e.g., computer / mobile
          phone)
     •    War
     •    Recession
     •    Death in the family
     •    Displaced
     •    Theft
     •    What were some of your recent life events?




Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 7: Saving and its Bene ts             64
When these life events occur – and they will – you need to make sure you are prepared to
pay for them. Otherwise, you may be forced to get an emergency loan or possibly be unable
to make the required payment and end up su ering the consequences.

Emergency Cash Reserve
Having a cash reserve is an important ingredient in post graduate nancial planning.
Realistically, while in university, most students have a limited income and any available funds
are usually committed to normal living expenses or student loan repayment requirements.
                   However, upon graduation and the attainment of a steady and substantial
                           stream of income, an emergency cash reserve should be a goal.

                                     Setting aside money to cover unexpected expenses provides
                                       a nancial safety net that lets you deal with “life events”
                                        as they arise. For example, if you were to lose a job, an
                                         emergency fund can pay your bills in the interim. Most
                                         experts recommend an emergency fund equal to three to
                                         six months of living expenses. This amount should be easy
                                        to calculate after having completed your budget in Chapter
                                      2. You simply take the amount you calculated for your total
                                    monthly expenses and then multiply it by 3 and then by 6. The
                                  three-month amount should be the minimum that you strive to
                               maintain in this savings account.

The amount of your emergency fund also depends upon your age, health, job prospects,
and personal nancial situation. An emergency fund covering three months of expenses
might be adequate if you are not the sole income earner in the household. In this case, if
your household has multiple sources of income or dual wage earners, you can count on
those other sources of income in an emergency. The three-month reserve may also be
adequate if you have lost a job but have a skill that is in demand and are con dent that you
can nd another job without much di culty.

However, there are many situations when you may need a cash reserve that is closer to the
six-month amount. Maybe you are in business for yourself, your work is seasonal, your job
is uncertain, or you rely heavily on sales’ commissions. Additional reasons for erring on the
conservative side are: if your health is questionable and you foresee medical expenses; or if
you anticipate a large expenditure for the care of a relative in the near future.

Your emergency savings should be kept at a nancial institution instead of at your home.
The main reason is for security of your money. If there is a re at your house, you can lose
your money in the re, or it may be lost due to theft.

Saving versus Investing

Even though the words ‘saving’ and ‘investing’ are often used interchangeably, there are
major di erences between the two.




Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 7: Saving and its Bene ts                   65
Saving provides funds for emergencies and for making
speci c purchases in the short-term (usually three years or   Since the bank’s good
less). The safety of the deposit and liquidity of the funds
(i.e., ease of converting to cash) are important aspects of
                                                            fortunewasmadepossible
saving. Because of these low-risk characteristics, savings   through the use of their
accounts generally do not yield a high rate of return on    customers’ deposits, the
the initial deposit.                                           logic follows that all

money into a bank savings or checking account. These                     rewards.
funds can normally be withdrawn at any time without
penalty. However, if you are willing to restrict access to your
money for a period of time, there are savings options that pay a
higher rate of return. For example, money market funds or certi cates of
deposit are options that pay more than a traditional savings or checking account.

Certi cate of deposit (CDs): low risk, low return investments, also known as “time deposits.”
The customer agrees to keep the money in the account for a speci ed amount of time,
anywhere from three months to six years.

Money Market account: a savings account that bears interest, and on which checks can be
written.

With these two options, in exchange for the higher rate of return, your money is not as
liquid. These savings products may require you to leave your money in an account for a
period of time. Usually the longer the time period required, the higher the interest rate
o ered.

Investing, on the other hand, focuses on increasing wealth and achieving nancial goals in
the long-term (usually three years or more). There are di erent types of investing, such as
purchasing real estate or stocks14. Stocks are listed and traded on stock exchanges around
the world. Since investing involves di erent degrees of risk (depending on your type of
investment), it should not be considered until you have adequate savings set aside.

Given that investing is a much more complex activity than saving, it is always wise to consult
a skilled banker or nancial professional. The characteristics of investing – in addition to their
complexity – include an element of risk, which can be somewhat mitigated if a professional
recommends diversi cation15. Without a professional to ensure a diversi ed portfolio, many
individuals tend to invest too heavily in one particular company or type of investment.

Smart investing also requires the need to resist emotional decisions when there are changes
in the stock market. Oftentimes, when people are faced with the prospect of losing money,
they react emotionally and not logically. Having a professional who is in charge of your
investments can help you to make rational decisions when, for example, your investments
in the stock market lose value. Although it is always wiser to buy low and sell high, many
people unfortunately do just the opposite when the value of their investments declines.

A good nancial advisor will ask you many questions, such as your present age, your desired
age at retirement, how much money you would like to accumulate before retirement, and
your risk tolerance level. These questions will help the professional formulate the best
investment portfolio for you. Since everyone’s individual needs are di erent, no one’s
investment mix should be the same.

Tips to Encourage Saving Behavior
Most people agree that saving is a good thing; they just say that it is impossible because of
their nancial situation. In reality, money that comes in has three places it can go – savings,
living expenses, or debt payments. The choice is up to you.

There is no way to predict whether someone will have a stronger tendency toward saving
money or toward spending it. Some researchers believe that these tendencies are ones
we are born with. You may know people that save easily; you may even be a natural saver
yourself. However, many people do not nd it easy to save, even if they agree that saving is
a good thing. They might say that it is impossible and come up with countless excuses as to
why “now” is not the best time to save.

          I cannot save because...

     •    I am a student and not earning any money yet.
     •    I am working at my rst job but not earning enough.
     •    I just became a parent and have childcare expenses.
     •    I have too many household bills.
     •    I am taking care of my elderly parents.
     •    What are your excuses?


Get into the habit of paying yourself rst. This is the most e ective      Paying yourself

spend. Another option that works on the same principle is to give
your paycheck / earnings to another person – someone whom you
trust – who will then deposit a certain amount into your savings account.

Other tips to make saving easier include:

     •    Never make a signi cant purchase on the rst trip. This is when you are emotional
          and your logical reasoning may not be present. Go home and think about it before
          you decide whether to buy. If you still want it a week or a month later, then it is
          probably not a frivolous purchase.


Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 7: Saving and its Bene ts              67
     •    Bring along someone who is conservative with their money when you go shopping.
          This ensures that any purchase you attempt to make will be di cult since the other
          person will oppose it.
     •    Identify areas in your budget where you could begin to cut back. You may be
          surprised at how much you spend on your mobile phone or on eating out. Make
          a reasoned decision about where you can spend less and put that sum away in
          savings.
     •    Put someone else in charge of your nances. If money slips like water out of your
          hands, let someone else take control of it. You may currently receive or have received
          money in this fashion from your parents in the form of an allowance.
     •    Consider yourself a creditor. When you pay your bills, write a check to yourself.
          Decide on a monthly amount that you can a ord (experts say we should try and
          save between 5-10% of our net income) and deposit that money into your savings
          account. Then, pay your other bills as usual. If you nd that you do not have enough
          money to cover all your expenses, write down the amount you are short and look for
          ways to trim your budget.
Once you establish a regular savings plan, consider increasing your monthly deposit as time
and experience result in your getting pay raises and better paying jobs. Many people in this
situation choose to increase their standard of living instead of saving the extra money. It is
important to resist this tendency; if you use the additional income to get a better car or a
nicer apartment, you are just increasing your expenses to match your increase in salary.

Another way to increase your monthly savings amount is after you pay o a debt. Once you
pay o your car loan, student loan, or other installment debt, you can deposit that exact
amount into a savings account. You will not miss the money since you were not used to
receiving it anyway – it went to your creditor.

Start Saving – The Sooner the Better
As a university student on a tight budget, saving money may be tough. However, the
advantage is that you can be aware of the bene ts of saving so that you can begin as soon
as you earn an income. Your savings normally accumulate interest, so the more you can
set aside, the more your account can earn, so your money grows faster. The interest rate is
usually expressed as a percentage, which allows your money to grow through multiplication
of the expressed interest rate.

There are two common ways that interest is calculated:

Simple interest. This is based only on the original amount. If your account has 500 dinars in
it and earns 5% simple interest per year, it earns 25 dinars in interest. Multiply the amount
by the interest rate to get the return.




Your Money, Your Future
Chapter 7: Saving and its Bene ts              68
Compound interest. Whenever interest in calculated, it is based not only on the original
amount in the account but also on any interest that has been added. The more frequently
interest is compounded, the faster the balance grows. The rate that
interest is compounded is referred to as the Annual Percentage
Rate (APR). Banks usually disclose this amount to you when you
open an account. This deceptively small, cumulative growth
makes compound interest extremely powerful. Albert
                                                                    The more

Rule of 72. This will give you an approximation of how long it
will take to double your money at a speci ed interest rate. The            grows.
Rule of 72 cites, “Any interest rate divided into the number 72
will give you the number of years necessary to double your initial
investment.” For example:

An investment earning 3 percent interest:

72 ÷ 3 = 24 years
If your initial investment is 200 dinars, it will take twenty-four years to reach 400 dinars and
forty-eight years to reach 800 dinars.

An investment earning 6 percent interest:

72 ÷ 6 = 12 years
If your initial investment is 200 dinars, it will take twelve years to reach 400, twenty-four
years to reach 800 and thirty-six years to reach 1,600.

This formula is especially useful for nancial estimates and understanding the nature of
compound interest.

The bene ts of starting to save early far outweigh those of choosing to wait. You should
start saving as soon as possible and save consistently throughout your life. With time on
your side and a commitment to putting money aside regularly, the money you accumulate
will aid you through short-term crises in addition to funding your future retirement.

                                    Saving to Reach your Goals

Have you thought about your life after university? You will likely be more nancially
independent. You will probably earn more money. You will also have more nancial
responsibilities, perhaps including student loans to pay back over time.

Hopefully this Guide has convinced you how important it is to be disciplined about paying
down your debt. Even if you are good about dealing with your debt, it is also bene cial
to have some additional money set aside. Those savings come in handy when you want
to purchase something that is not normally part of your monthly budget or pay for an
unexpected expense.

Saving money is helpful for many reasons and setting goals for saving is a great way to
motivate yourself to avoid spending all that you make. It is not di cult to start with short-
term savings goals (such as buying a camera) and build up to bigger, longer-term goals
(such as paying for a car). Follow the steps below to set up your own savings plan.

     1. De ne your goals. Make a list of your nancial goals and all the things for which you
        want to save money. There is no limit to the list; just write down all the things that
        come to mind.

     __________________________________               _________________________________

     __________________________________               _________________________________

     2. Organize your list. Prioritize the items you wrote down by numbering them in order
        of importance. Then, break your list up into short-term and long-term goals using
        the chart below, with the most important goals at the top of each column. You might
        think of short-term goals as those you can accomplish in the next six months. Long-
        term goals will take longer.

          You will use the chart on the previous page to create an actual savings plan for
          accomplishing your goals in Activity 3.

     3. Think about the bene ts of accomplishing each of your goals. A new cell phone
        might allow you to talk with your cousins more regularly. Maybe the car will allow
        you to get to school or perhaps to work quicker. Regardless of the costs associated
        with your goals, recognize that there is an intrinsic value in achieving them.


Take It Another Step
Evaluate how your priorities have changed as you have gotten older. Are there things you
want to save for that you wanted when you were 12 years old? How have your priorities
changed over time? What are some of the things you are thinking about saving for now that
may not be on your list in 5 or 10 years?

Setting aside savings will take some discipline. However, it comes with rewards beyond
the assurance of having money available for big purchases or an unexpected challenge.
Because of interest or mark-up, saving small amounts over time can add up signi cantly, as
illustrated in the hypothetical situation below.

When you have the luxury of time, saving for long-term goals is an easy decision. But there is
another important factor in growing your money: the rate of return. Consider the example
below, which illustrates what happens to an initial 709 dinars investment at di erent rates
of return.

Now, consider the goals that you set for yourself in the previous activity, and answer the
following questions:

          -    How long will it take me to achieve each of my short-term goals?

               _________________________________________________________________
          -    What about the long-term goals?

               _________________________________________________________________
          -    Will I need to access my money while it is in savings?

               _________________________________________________________________
          -    How much can I realistically expect to earn on my savings?

               _________________________________________________________________


Answering these questions may help you determine what type of savings option will be
best for achieving your goals, both short-term and long-term.


Take It Another Step
Visit a bank and learn about the savings options available to you. There are many di erent
types of accounts with di erent rates of return. A bank will be able to set you up with an
account that is best for you and your short- and long-term goals. Even if you are not ready
to open an account yet, review your options, and ask questions you may have about the
di erent options.

                                       Create a Savings Plan

So, you have de ned some of your short-term and long-term goals. And you have learned
the importance of time and the rate of return on helping you save for and achieve your
goals. Now it is time to create a savings plan!

     1. In the chart below, ll in the rst column with the short-term and long-term nancial
        goals you de ned in Activity 1.
     2. In the next column, enter your estimate of the amount of money needed to achieve
        the goal.
     3. Then, ll in the amount of time needed to save for the goal, and the amount
        you will save each month toward that goal. For long-term goals, consider any
        interest you may earn on your savings. For example, with the car purchase below,
        you would need to earn about a 4% rate of return on your savings in order to
        accumulate 2000 dinars over two years.



        Short-Term                  Amount Needed        Length of Time    Monthly Savings
      Financial Goals                                                       Contribution

   A new cell phone                   100 dinars           4 months           25 dinars




        Long-Term                   Amount Needed        Length of Time    Monthly Savings
      Financial Goals                                                       Contribution

   A used car                        2000 dinars            2 years           80 dinars




          Remember, the earlier you begin saving, the earlier you can reach your goals.
     4. Consider the opportunity costs. Are there expenses and activities you are willing to
        give up in order to reach your goals?

Take It Another Step
Consider goals beyond the nancial spectrum. What are some of the things you want to
do in your life, regardless of money? Do you want to become a doctor? A parent? Where
do you want to spend your time? These are questions that will become relevant when you
are developing a nancial plan, as they involve managing both your time and your money.
