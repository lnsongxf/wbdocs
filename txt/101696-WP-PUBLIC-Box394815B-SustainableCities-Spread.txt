     ARUSHA ENHANCES FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY WITH NEW
     ELECTRONIC OWN-SOURCE REVENUE COLLECTION SYSTEM

     Cities and towns in Tanzania, led by Arusha, have begun to institute a global
     best-practice property tax revenue collection system—the first step in a set of
     municipal e-governance initiatives.

     Tanzania has had relatively stable governance, strong economic growth and
     rapid urbanization over the last decade. However, despite Tanzania’s 7%
     average annual growth during the past decade, 40% of Tanzanian adults
     remain in extreme poverty.1 Tanzania is in dire need of urban infrastructure and
     lacks a sustainable means to fund infrastructure and essential public services.

     Cities in Tanzania and across the developing world struggle for municipal
     financing, because of overreliance on fiscal transfers from the central
     government—which can be unreliable—and on external donor funding.
     Through the World Bank’s Tanzanian Strategic Cities Project, Arusha has
     obtained the training and technology to improve own-source revenue
     collection and lessen its dependence on inter-governmental fiscal transfers.
     The case presents a successful initiative with the potential to be scaled across
     Tanzania and Africa.

     Although property taxes are the city’s main source of local revenue, Arusha
     had historically been unable to process and enforce property tax payments
     efficiently, resulting in low own-source revenue collection. The city had tried
     to improve collection, but with poor results; tax-related information from field

     JOHANNESBURG PURSUES FISCAL AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
     THROUGH URBAN DEVELOPMENT

     Johannesburg is working to bring more urban development into its core
     areas with an eye toward long-term economic and social benefits.

     South Africa’s cities struggle with high unemployment, high inequality,
     persistent segregation, and service delivery challenges. At the same time, as of
     2009 the nine largest cities are responsible for 59% of total economic output in
     the country.1 Increasingly, national government attention is focusing on cities’
     functioning and how well cities can lower costs and finance new infrastructure
     through financial tools to utilize land values.

     South Africa’s National Treasury has recently moved to address these issues by
     creating the Cities Support Program, a package of analytics, local government
     capacity building and technical assistance aimed at promoting the inclusivity
     and productivity of South Africa’s large cities. The World Bank is providing
     policy and investment advice under a multi-year advisory services agreement
     including advice to eight metropolitan cities and the national government on
     increasing competitiveness, improving mobility, efficient financing of urban
     infrastructure, improving urban land management, improving delivery of
     housing, improving environmental and social management of investments.

     Under this Cities Support Program, Johannesburg is working with the World
     Bank on setting out urban regeneration and mixed-use development projects,

     Kampala, Uganda
     UGANDAN CAPITAL MOVES TOWARD FISCAL AND FINANCIAL
     SUSTAINABILITY WITH WORLD BANK HELP

     Major administrative problems were outstripping the ability of Kampala,
     Uganda’s capital, to properly manage its rapid urbanization.

     With an annual urbanization rate of more than 5%, Uganda’s cities have
     become increasingly important to the country’s economic growth and
     transformation --urbanization in Uganda is estimated at 12% to 15%, but cities
     account for 72% of the country’s manufacturing output and more than 55% of
     GDP.

     The country’s rapid urbanization has caused some important problems. For
     example, urban areas remain underserved and poorly managed, infrastructure
     backlogs are severe, and more than 60% of city dwellers live in informal
     settlements. As people have been moving to urban areas, Uganda’s municipal
     and local governments have begun to grow and acquire more responsibilities,
     spurring distinctive needs such as stronger institutional systems of local
     governance and administration to plan and manage new settlements, and
     for ways to pay and meet the rising demand for infrastructure. Typical urban
     investments such as providing lighting and improving roads cost between 100
     million and 1 billion shillings (US$ 28,000 to US$ 276,000), compared to an
     average of about 10 million shillings in rural areas.

     There were gaps and inefficiencies in Kampala’s financial management before
     2010, weakening delivery of services and infrastructure to the city’s growing
     population. For example, the city operated through 151 unauthorized city
     bank accounts, managed cash handling in a way that was highly susceptible
     to misuse, and ran multiple revenue collection centers. There was a lack of
     documented financial policies, poor legislation was in place to support revenue
     mobilization, there was poor enforcement, weak field collection and vigilance,

NAIROBI’S POOR, IN INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS, RECEIVE PIPED
WATER AND SEWERAGE FOR FIRST TIME

Subsidies and technological innovations used as new tools to extend water
and sanitation services to poor in Nairobi’s informal settlements.

Kenya faces huge challenges in bringing water and sanitation services to
the urban poor, accounting for more than 60% of those in cities. As of 2015,
only about 36 percent of those in informal settlement households in Nairobi
have access to piped water in their house or compound, while 84 percent
of households in formal areas do. Although their attitude is now changing,
Kenyan authorities and utilities have long avoided bringing infrastructure
services to informal settlements, either because of potential disputes over land
ownership, or because users are perceived to be unable to pay for services such
as water, sanitation and electricity.

Nairobi’s city government is working with the World Bank for greater social
sustainability—to bring water and sanitation services to the urban poor and
thereby standardize access to these public services. The Kenya informal
settlements improvement project is financing trunk water and sewerage lines
in informal settlements in Nairobi. This is the first Bank supported project in
Kenya aimed at upgrading infrastructure in slums. A separate project financed
through the Bank provides subsidies and loans for the last-mile connections in
these poor communities. These subsidies come from the Global Partnership on
Output-Based Aid—a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank
that aims to improve the delivery of basic services to the poor in developing
countries. The target for Nairobi alone is 16,000 connections serving over
110,000 people.

The subsidies offer households $175 for sewerage connection and $80 for water

     Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
     An integrated strategy in Ho Chi Minh City focused on urban improvements,
     flood-risk management, and institutional reforms is promoting the
     competitiveness and sustainability of the city.

     Ho Chi Minh City has a population of approximately 7.7 million as of 2014.
     The city’s nominal GDP growth in the last five years averaged about 10.8%,
     accounting for 20% of national GDP. As the leading megacity in Vietnam, it
     attracts huge numbers of immigrants, including poor people from all over the
     country. This has been particularly true in the past 20 years, as labor-intensive
     industries have fueled economic growth, which has made the city expand
     significantly. Meanwhile, the majority of the land area of the city is located
     less than 2 meters above sea level which makes it particularly vulnerable
     to flooding. These conditions have led to an integrated strategy towards
     sustainable development. The city is focusing on promoting institutional
     reforms such as better financial management and greater participation of the
     private sector to increase competitiveness; reorganizing the local government
     to better respond to flooding; and rehabilitating and constructing infrastructure
     for increased resilience and to better serve the growing urban population.
     Ho Chi Minh City is also the business and commercial heart of the country
     contributing 45 percent of the country’s manufacturing. The Government of
     Vietnam recognizes the important role of urbanization in the overall economic
     development of the country and is keen to invest in Ho Chi Minh City as it
     continues to shift from labor-intensive manufacturing industries to knowledge-
     and technology-intensive activities, enabling it to become a leading city in the
     region.

     One of the most concerted efforts of the city has been around the issue of
     flooding. Ho Chi Minh City faces regular flooding during the June-November
     rainy seasons and during high tidal peak periods from September to December,
     due to such factors as heavy rain, land sinking caused by ground water

     Quezon City, Philippines
     Quezon City, Metro Manila’s largest city, comprising around a quarter of the
     metropolitan land area and population –2.76 million people as of the latest
     census in 2010—, is recognized for its innovations and reforms, particularly
     regarding major development challenges.

     FISCAL AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
     In 2001, a new administration took over the management of the local
     government of Quezon City. At that time, Quezon City was the most financially
     distressed local government unit in Metro Manila. It faced a serious budget
     deficit and its general fund was overdrawn. It also had huge outstanding
     obligations to basic service providers, which included private utility companies,
     of PHP 1.4 billion (~US$ 30 million) and a bank debt of PHP 1.2 billion (~US$ 26
     million). The local government’s predicament was how to increase its income
     not only to pay its existing obligations but also to finance its development
     needs. To address this, the local government introduced fiscal and financial
     reforms. For example, it converted real property tax (RPT) records from index
     card entries into a computerized tax information system. This has allowed
     the local government to reconcile actual and recorded RPT payments in real
     time, detect disparity in tax records, and reduce misdemeanors in various
     stages of tax assessment and collection. It also reduced the time for payment
     transactions from 3-5 hours to 30 minutes. Furthermore, the local government
     was able to uncover tax delinquencies in the amount of PHP 10.7 billion (~US$
     230 million). In addition, Quezon City used geo-spatial technology called
     “eTAXMAPS” that integrates and synchronizes parcel tax maps with land tax
     records. Using this tool, the local government has a better view of the overall
     tax collection in the city, having a better capability to identify undeclared,
     misclassified and unaccounted-for properties.

     The local government also raised its business taxes to increase revenues. At the
     time, the Quezon City’s business tax rates were among the lowest among Metro

     Georgia’s capital has taken concrete steps to become a low-carbon city by
     2020, striving to meet European Union objectives to reduce CO2 emissions.
     The World Bank has been supporting the city for the last two decades
     in its municipal infrastructure rehabilitation, energy-efficiency, traffic
     management, transport planning, and formulation of a participatory city
     development vision 2030.

     Pledging to become a low-carbon city by 2020, Tbilisi has joined the European
     Union Covenant of Mayors and aims to meet the EU objectives to reduce
     CO2 emissions by 20%. The city submitted its 2011-2020 policy document on
     sustainable energy, which identifies activities in multiple sectors that would
     allow the city to meet its carbon-reduction target.

     The City has already completed many energy efficiency activities, including
     retrofitting residential buildings and upgrading its urban transport fleet.

     With annual co-financing from the city totaling 25 million Georgian lari (US$10
     million), the residents’ condominium associations are repairing building
     roofs, elevators, entrances, windows, plumbing, and installing sensor lighting.
     Residential buildings have been fully equipped with advanced heating systems.
     Energy efficiency activities have been launched in kindergartens. Tbilisi’s old
     landfill was closed and replaced, the street lighting system has been upgraded
     with energy efficient bulbs and the city’s water system is shifting from pumping
     into gravity.

     With an eye toward improving air quality and cutting vehicle greenhouse
     gas emissions, the city is expanding its public transportation system through

     The World Bank has been providing capital investments and technical
     assistance throughout the city’s reform process under a series of municipal
     development projects. The Bank has assisted Tbilisi to recognize that
     integrated improvements in public and private transport, public lighting, solid
     waste management, and municipal buildings are critical for the city to enhance
     its performance in energy-efficiency.

     Through its energy assessment of Tbilisi, the World Bank recommended that
     the city better integrate land use and transport planning to improve access to
     jobs and education. It encouraged use of public and non-motorized transport,
     through such means as traffic or parking restraints to limit private vehicle use,
     and improving public bus service by upgrading buses, adjusting routes, and
     establishing dedicated bus lanes.

     Istanbul, Turkey
     Located on a major fault line, Istanbul has become a model for disaster
     risk management, and one of the world’s most proactive cities in terms of
     safeguarding against seismic risks.

     Earthquakes are a substantial risk for Turkey. For example, a 7.6 magnitude
     earthquake struck the Marmara region in 1999 affecting Istanbul, the highest
     magnitude earthquake in the country’s recent history, killing more than 17,000
     and causing an estimated US$ 5 billion in physical damages and losses to the
     Turkish economy. The city still faces a high risk of earthquakes in the coming
     decades since it lies on the major North Anatolia seismic fault line.

     Following the 1999 earthquake, Turkey realized that it was poorly prepared
     to prevent or manage disasters, calling for the need to reform building
     codes for future construction as well as to retrofit existing infrastructure. In
     response, Turkey launched the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency
     Preparedness Project (ISMEP) in 2006, with help from the World Bank,
     European Investment Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank, and Islamic
     Development Bank – assistance that helped the government gain credibility
     and local support for the effort.

     The project is aimed at making Istanbul more resistant to major disasters within
     the next 20 to 30 years, thus making the city more sustainable. Its components
     are designed to improve city disaster management and emergency response
     capabilities, and to retrofit public facilities as hospitals, schools and housing
     to better withstand seismic shocks. The effort is also designed to develop risk-
     assessment techniques for commercial, industrial and residential buildings,
     and improve enforcement of building codes.

     Already, two command-and-control centers have been built – one on the
     European side and one on the Asian side of the city–to centralize and better

     other information using social media and text messaging. Many hospitals,            digitalized address-based data, allowing them to better track the buildings and

     Beyond the Pipes – Supporting sustainable planning, rehabilitation and
     expansion of Water Supply and Sanitation Service Delivery in Metropolitan
     Lima

     In Lima, Peru, the World Bank has been working with Servicio de Agua Potable y
     Alcantarillado de Lima, or SEDAPAL, since 1995 to improve water and sanitation
     service delivery to more than 8 million people.

     The Peruvian capital, Latin America’s fifth-largest metropolitan area, averages
     only 9 mm of annual precipitation, making it the second-largest desert
     city in the world. Its rapidly growing population, recurring water shortages,
     competition for water among different users and for different purposes
     (domestic, industrial, agriculture), have posed major service delivery
     challenges, and an estimated 1 million people still lack adequate water and
     sanitation services. The impacts of climate change will further strain the
     region’s water resources.

     This note describes initiatives undertaken by SEDAPAL and the Peruvian
     government since 2009 with World Bank and other Development partners’
     support:

     EXPANSION OF WATER AND SEWERAGE NETWORKS IN PARTS OF
     LIMA’S NORTHERN SERVICE AREA

     In 2009, Peru approached the World Bank, the Japan International Cooperation
     Agency (JICA), and KfW (a German development bank) requesting support for
     the design and implementation of a comprehensive program – Lima Norte
     Program – to improve SEDAPAL’s operations.

     The Program developed a series of demand and supply management activities
     in order to free scarce water resources for new users. The Program’s efforts

     and future demand and identifying ways to meet demand more efficiently,           shape Lima’s options? How should the investments in the plan be prioritized,
     finding management bottlenecks and developing a new organizational model,         and could some be delayed? Using state-of-the-art methods for decision

     MEDELLIN WORKING WITH WORLD BANK ON INNOVATION AND
     URBAN REDEVELOPMENT

     Medellin is strengthening economic vitality within its Innovation District
     and striving to promote urban redevelopment, while retaining affordable
     housing, in its downtown area.

     Over the second half of the 20th century Colombia has experienced a rapid
     urbanization process resulting in over 75% of the population today living in
     cities—from 6 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in 1951 to 61 such cities
     today. It is estimated that by 2050 over 85% of the population will live in cities,
     which means around 20 million new urban dwellers, demanding infrastructure,
     urban services, jobs and improvements in quality of life. To better understand
     the challenges in the urban sector and to develop policy alternatives, the
     Government of Colombia and the World Bank conducted the Colombia
     Urbanization Review: Amplifying the Gains from the Urban Transition, which
     focused on Connecting, Planning and Financing Colombian cities.

     In the case of Medellin, the World Bank is supporting the city in the
     implementation of a scientific, technological and Innovative District that seeks
     to strengthen the innovation ecosystem, while transforming the urban layout by
     promoting the use of more efficient infrastructure and mixed-income real estate
     development. The support of the Bank has been focused on providing strategic
     analysis on innovation strategies and the use of an innovative tax increment
     financing instrument to diversify funding and attract private sector investments.

     Medellin has become known as one of the world’s most innovative cities,
     and was named “Innovative City of the Year” in 2013 by a Wall Street Journal,
     Urban Land Institute and Citi competition. It has become innovative through
     what Medellin city officials refer to as “social urbanism”—a mix of social work,

     JORDAN: CULTURAL HERITAGE, TOURISM, AND URBAN
     DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

     Jordanian historic cities became more livable for their citizens and more
     attractive for tourists, with a joint effort of the Government and the World
     Bank Group

     The World Bank Group helped Jordan with an integrated project targeting
     five historic downtowns. The project enhanced livability for local communities,
     strengthened social cohesion, and improved city competiveness, creating an
     enabling environment for local businesses to grow, with a particular focus on
     businesses working in cultural heritage and sustainable tourism.

     Tourism rooted on cultural assets has indeed always been important to
     Jordan’s economy. However, starting in the late 1990s, the country begun
     lagging behind other regional destinations in growth rate, market share and,
     even more importantly from a poverty reduction perspective, length of stay
     and per capita spending. Till that time, tourism development strategies had
     focused mainly on Petra, Jordan’s premier attraction, and few other sites.
     Jordan changed its direction with the 2004 National Tourism Strategy, a
     pioneering effort that resulted in broadening the country’s tourism appeal,
     improving quality, and increasing employment, business turnover and
     earnings. The country’s medium-term objective was to bring tourists beyond
     traditional sites, to bring their spending where poverty is and extend their
     stay. Additionally, the strategy recognized the need for a greater integration of
     elements of the sustainable tourism model now used widely (with communities
     and tourists at its foundation), giving value to both domestic and international
     tourism, priority to local economic development, social cohesion, improving
     cultural and natural heritage sites, rehabilitating historic city cores, and raising

     WORLD BANK HELPS SOUTHERN WEST BANK TURN AROUND
     FAILING WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

     A new solid waste management system in the Southern West Bank includes
     better trained professionals, the rehabilitation and closure of unsanitary
     dumpsites and a new model to work with the private sector in implementing
     a sanitary landfill.

     As of 2014, more than 4 million people live within 1,000 square miles in the
     Palestinian territories, where the amount of solid waste threatens both the
     environment and health. Furthermore, more than 2,500 tons of waste are
     produced each day. 34% of which is generated in the Hebron and Bethlehem
     governorates in the Southern West Bank.

     The solid waste management system in the Palestinian territories was plagued
     in recent years by poor service planning, low collection and disposal capacity,
     inadequate fee collection, and insufficient national and local funding for
     upgrades. Medical waste and household waste were disposed of together in
     uncontrolled dumpsites, and solid waste was randomly dumped in open lots,
     along roadsides and in more than 19 unsanitary dumpsites spread across
     villages. Waste burning was also common.

     These practices threatened public health through both pollution of the
     groundwater aquifers that are the main local water source and because of air
     pollution from the burning of waste. They were also a major barrier to tourism.

     Local governments in the Southern West Bank implemented a number of
     transformative solid waste management projects with World Bank support.

IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOLID WASTE SECTOR IN MOROCCO

Facing difficulties in managing its municipal solid waste (MSW), Morocco
several years ago launched a comprehensive multi-year program to improve
the governance and performance of their MSW system.

Until 2006, Morocco focused its solid waste services on keeping streets and
neighborhoods clean, focusing mostly on collection, but giving little attention
to disposal or environmental and social impact.

In an effort to improve the sector, the country enacted its first solid waste law
in 2006 and, shortly thereafter, approved a 15-year national program to expand
municipal solid waste collection services, improve disposal practices and
promote recycling. The plan envisioned 90% collection coverage, 100% sanitary
landfill disposal, the closure of 300 open dumps and 20% sorting of recyclable
materials by 2021. Putting the program into effect remained a challenge,
which led to Morocco approaching the World Bank for assistance.

Authorities wanted to improve transparency and citizen engagement by
implementing the new law, which provided a clear framework for the sector
and the promotion of efficiency. Initiatives have included publishing all
municipal solid waste contracts with private operators on the Government’s
website, establishing 14 centers to report and publish relevant data,
introducing citizen report cards for citizen feedback, and instituting contracting
reforms such as introducing a dispute resolution clause in private contracts.
Officials instituted mechanisms and incentives for municipalities and private
firms to support the continuation of investments and services, such as cutting
government debt to private operators, to improve financial sustainability.

Several steps were taken to integrate social and environmental considerations

                                                                                     85

     to other recycling projects. As of mid-2015, about 200 million dirhams (US$         social issues into the national framework. The cooperation with the World Bank
     22 million) have been collected from eco-tax revenues. About 20% of the tax         was also successful, a key aspect being an extensive and long-term dialogue

     To build institutional efficiency, the government, with World Bank help, set
     up the National Commission of Solid Waste Management, which coordinates                  ACHIEVEMENTS:

     CHITTAGONG’S EXPORT ZONE IMPLEMENTS GREEN INITIATIVES TO
     BOOST COMPETITIVENESS

     Chittagong, Bangladesh’s economic capital, is working with the World Bank
     to increase its growth and energy efficiency while addressing the problems of
     climate change.

     The World Bank Group (WBG) and the Korea Industrial Complex Corporation,
     a state-owned development agency, are working to identify ways to cut
     greenhouse gas emissions from Chittagong’s export processing zone, one of
     eight such zones in the country.

     Energy costs and supply and a trend toward green products are pushing
     Bangladeshi industry toward increased energy efficiency. The Chittagong zone
     has faced increasing electricity costs and, as with other EPZs, has suffered from
     power outages and unreliable supply. Industrial energy rates for the Chittagong
     EPZ have jumped five times in two years.

     The WBG (including both the World Bank and International Finance
     Corporation) effort is aimed at cutting carbon emissions through institutional
     and regulatory changes, as well as training and education.

     An initial inventory showed the Chittagong zone was emitting 330,000 metric
     tons of greenhouse gas a year. The WBG team identified a number of ways to
     save energy, including some quick fixes, such as improving boiler efficiency.
     Cogeneration—using a power unit’s waste heat to generate steam for other
     enterprises—emerged as a way method to save energy. Initially, energy
     regulations did not support the buying and selling of steam, but cogeneration’s
     potential benefits provided incentives to scale up the practice. National
     legislation on cogeneration has since been approved.

     MYSORE’S INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM ENHANCING BUS
     SERVICE, HELPING AVOID TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND COSTS

     Mysore, India uses an intelligent transport system to ease the strain for
     commuters, allowing it to provide safer and more reliable bus service.

     Southern India’s historic city of Mysore is trying to increase public transport use
     to avoid the traffic congestion common to Indian cities.

     Authorities in the tourist destination, educational center and developing IT hub
     of almost one million in Karnataka state are trying to deal with growing traffic
     congestion using an intelligent transport system to improve the city’s public bus
     service. The initiative is the result of Mysore’s participation in India’s national
     urban strategy and World Bank support.

     Mysore is generally well planned, without larger Indian cities’ traffic congestion,
     but it wanted to head off future problems, particularly given the spread
     of population and economic activity from larger to smaller cities, which is
     common in India.

     Without action on public transport, the city feared more clogged traffic, and
     higher fuel consumption and pollution. Furthermore, the city’s public transport
     ridership was low compared to private transport use.

     The World Bank’s sustainable urban transport program in India promotes
     intelligent transport systems, bus rapid-transit systems and public bike sharing.
     Together with India’s Urban Development Ministry and the Karnataka State

      LAND POOLING IN THIMPHU, BHUTAN

      Bhutan’s capital uses land pooling, an alternative to eminent domain, to
      promote more inclusive and efficient urban development.

      Bhutan is undergoing a rapid transition from a rural economy to an urban
      society. The average annual urban population growth rate has been around 4
      percent since 2007. Given its small population, the country is relatively well
      positioned to meet the challenge of rapid urbanization. Nevertheless, the
      limited availability of serviced land is a challenge and urban institutional and
      governance systems need to be strengthened.

      In this context, the city authority is using land pooling to facilitate urban
      development. Land pooling is a participatory approach in which a group of
      neighboring land owners and occupants combine their land together for unified
      planning and redevelopment in collaboration with the government or private
      developers. In this process, each participating household contributes land for
      building basic infrastructure and public amenities based on the needs of the
      community, and in return, receives a serviced land plot of smaller area with at
      least equal value in the vicinity of the original site upon the completion of the
      project. Land pooling is an alternative to eminent domain, which often raises
      issues such as fairness and transparency. Land pooling fosters collaboration
      and ownership, because it requires landowners to agree on planning, servicing
      and redevelopment decisions.

      Thimphu’s urban area expanded from 8 to 26 square kilometers in 1999, and
      after extensive consultation, the first comprehensive master plan was approved
      in 2003. Implementation required preparation of local area plans (LAPs) to
      show the details of infrastructure networks and other services. Fourteen
      such plans were prepared for the newly included areas using the approach
