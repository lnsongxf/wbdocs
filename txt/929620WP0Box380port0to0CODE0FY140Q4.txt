      Working paper "Monitoring and Evaluation System: The Case of Chile 1990-2014".
      Working paper "How-to Guide on Managing Evaluations".

Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR):

      A grant for evaluation capacity building over $2.9 million was signed with the University
       of Witwatersrand.
      The CLEAR program is undergoing an independent formative mid-term evaluation and
       IEG’s team has worked with all stakeholders on providing input. The first draft of the
       evaluation is expected in early July 2014.

International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET) 2014:

      The IPDET 2014 Core Course was attended by 154 participants from 68 countries. 60%
       of the professionals attending IPDET were under 40. The group was highly educated,
       with 70% having a master's, 12% a PhD, and of the 18% BAs; many have two degrees.
       60% of attendees were women (up from 53% women in 2013). Including the two
       workshop weeks, IPDET attendance adds up to 215 participants in total. Many of
       IPDET’s highly successful workshops were offered again, but the new workshops also
       attracted strong participation, including offers by IEG staff.

Management Action Record:

      The update of the adoption of IEG's recommendations will start in July and the results of
       the Management Action Record exercise (that is, rating of the level of adoption) will be
       presented in the 2014 Results and Performance of the World Band Group (RAP) report.

                                                5
Knowledge Management:

Projects under way or completed:

        Completion of the first phase of the IEG Data Mart, which launched with 12 maps
         visualizing IEG/World Bank Group data.
        Progress on adoption of a Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) System:
         Discussions have begun with ITS on the requirements and process needed to adopt a CRM
         and how it can be implemented into the Bank's broader IT platforms.
        Continued progress on the Information Management and Technology Solutions action plan,
         which will establish a high-quality full-text search platform to index all document
         collections relevant to IEG’s evaluation research.

Web traffic to IEG resources

Overall, downloads of IEG resources continued to increase, with a total of 3,045 across the three
months of Q4, while the number of unique visitors up to 162,876 (Q3: 113, 127). The growth is
partly a result of ongoing use of social media, in particular twitter and linkedIN, but also appears
to relate to the posting of IEG’s new blog series (“What Works”) which has helped significantly
diversify traffic across developing countries visitors in particular:
