THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

CHANGES IN DOING BUSINESS 2017

As part of a three-year update in methodology, Doing Business 2017 expands further by adding postfiling processes to
the paying taxes indicator, including a gender component in three of the indicators and developing a new pilot
indicator on selling to the government. Also, for the first time this year Doing Business collects data on Somalia,
bringing the total number of economies covered to 190.
The paying taxes indicator is expanded this year to include postfiling processes – those processes that occur after a
firm complies with its regular tax obligations. These include tax refunds, tax audits and tax appeals. In particular, Doing
Business measures the time it takes to get a value added tax (VAT) refund, deal with a simple mistake on a corporate
tax return that can potentially trigger an audit and good practices with administrative appeals process.
This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a business,
registering property, enforcing contracts and labor market regulation. Three of these areas are included in the distance
to frontier score and in the ease of doing business ranking, while the fourth—labor market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies were men.
This was incomplete by not reflecting correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to women—which in some
economies may be different from the processes applied to men. Starting this year, Doing Business measures the
starting a business process for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are men and one where all
entrepreneurs are women. In economies where the processes are more onerous if the entrepreneur is a woman, Doing
Business now counts the extra procedures applied to roughly half of the population that is female (for example,
obtaining a husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a gender component has been added to the quality of land
administration index. This component measures women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property according to the
law. Finally, within the enforcing contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on having equal evidentiary weight
of women’s testimony in court.
Also for the first time this year Doing Business collects data on Somalia, bringing the total number of economies
covered to 190.

chapter starting on page 1 of the Doing Business 2017 report. For more details on the data and methodology, please

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by
any economy on each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting
minority investors, paying taxes and resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only
comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits, registering property, trading across borders, enforcing
contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are only comparable to 2014. The measure
is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the frontier). See the data notes
starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

score as the economy at the threshold.

quality and efficiency in the court system. This new         Court structure and proceedings (0-5)
index replaces the indicator on procedures, which
was eliminated this year. The ranking of economies           Case management (0-6)
on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by          Court automation (0-4)
sorting their distance to frontier scores. These scores

are the simple average of the distance to frontier
scores for each of the component indicators
The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
   The value of the claim is equal to 200% of the
    economy’s income per capita or $5,000,
    whichever is greater.
   The dispute concerns a lawful transaction
    between two businesses (Seller and Buyer), both
    located in the economy’s largest business city.
    For 11 economies the data are also collected for
    the second largest business city.
   Seller (the plaintiff) sues Buyer (the defendant) to
    recover the amount under the sales agreement.
    The dispute is brought before the court located
    in the economy’s largest business city with
    jurisdiction over commercial cases worth 200%
    Doing Business 2017                SOUTH ASIA (SA)     126




    of income per capita or $5,000, whichever is
    greater. As noted, for 11 economies the data are
    also collected for the second largest business
    city.
   At the outset of the dispute, Seller decides to
    attach Buyer’s movable assets (for example,
    office equipment and vehicles) because Seller
    fears that Buyer may hide its assets or otherwise
    become insolvent.
   The claim is disputed on the merits because of
    Buyer’s allegation that the quality of the goods
    was not adequate. Because the court cannot
    decide the case on the basis of documentary
    evidence or legal title alone, an expert opinion is
    given on the quality of the goods. If it is standard
    practice in the economy for each party to call its
    own expert witness, the parties each call one
    expert witness. If it is standard practice for the
    judge to appoint an independent expert, the
    judge does so. In this case the judge does not
    allow opposing expert testimony
   Following the expert opinion, the judge decides
    that the goods delivered by Seller were of
    adequate quality and that Buyer must pay the
    contract price. The judge thus renders a final
    judgment that is 100% in favor of Seller.
   Buyer does not appeal the judgment. Seller
    decides to start enforcing the judgment as soon
    as the time allocated by law for appeal lapses.
   Seller takes all required steps for prompt
    enforcement of the judgment. The money is
    successfully collected through a public sale of
    Buyer’s movable assets (for example, office
    equipment and vehicles).

What do the indicators cover?
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of
insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities. These variables are used to calculate the
recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the
dollar recovered by secured creditors through
reorganization, liquidation or debt enforcement
(foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To
determine the present value of the amount
recovered by creditors, Doing Business uses the
lending rates from the International Monetary Fund,
supplemented with data from central banks and the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
To make the data on the time, cost and outcome
comparable across economies, several assumptions
about the business and the case are used:
   A hotel located in the largest city (or cities) has
    201 employees and 50 suppliers. The hotel
    experiences financial difficulties.
   The value of the hotel is 100% of the income per
    capita or the equivalent in local currency of USD
    200,000, whichever is greater.
   The hotel has a loan from a domestic bank,
    secured by a mortgage over the hotel’s real
    estate. The hotel cannot pay back the loan, but
    makes enough money to operate otherwise.

* Indicates a “no practice” mark. See the data notes for details. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific
area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible”
mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “ no

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
