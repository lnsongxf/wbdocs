FOREWARD BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR




        I am delighted to welcome the Deputies to this meeting, holding here in DC on the margins
of the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group.

I also take this opportunity to present to you EDS25 Constituency Report to Governors at this
Spring meetings. You will recall that based on request in Kigali, Rwanda, we would now have one
full-fledged Annual Report for the Constituency during the annual Meetings, a shorter version of
the Report at Spring and periodic briefing Notes to capitals based on the activities at the Board
which we will send to the capitals from time. This agreement was re-stated during the last
ministerial meeting in Washington DC, USA and this is what we committed to. The Report contains
a summary of recent major events; updates of World Bank Group strategies, policies, 2015
projects and programs, as well as progress reports on some Bank activities as at April 10, 2015.
It also presents the status of our countries’ portfolio and programs with the World Bank Group;
as well as highlighting some administrative matters and events. I trust that Deputies will find the
report useful and look forward to very fruitful deliberations at the Spring Meetings.

Lastly, I would like to thank the Governors for the strong support since I took over as Executive
Director of this constituency. I would also like to thank Dr. Mansur Muhtar, my immediate
predecessor and Mr. Kurt Joseph Morais, Senior Advisor for their service to this Constituency. I
also welcome the new Alternate Executive Director- Ms. Bongi Kunene to the Constituency and
thank the entire team in the office for their support and cooperation.

Sincerely,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global economy is still struggling to gain momentum as many high-income countries continue
to grapple with the negative effects of the 2008/09 global financial crisis while emerging markets
are less dynamic than in the recent past. In 2014, global growth was lower than initially expected,
continuing a pattern of disappointing outturns over several years, with a marginal increase to 2.6
percent, from the 2.5 percent in 2013.

For the first six months of FY15, loan commitments totaled $14.4 billion, over 2 times the amount
committed in the similar period of FY14. This increase was exceptionally high due to a strong
pipeline developed in the second half of FY14, following the increase in the Single Borrowing
Limit (SBL) and the strong Q1 ahead of new pricing measures effective October 1, 2014. While
IFC total commitments were $8.9 billion, compared with $7.3 billion in the first half of FY14, a
decrease of 23%, of which $5.0 billion is from its own account and $3.9 through core mobilization
during the same period. In case of MIGA, a total of 18 new guarantee contracts and additions to 5
existing contracts were issued for a total of $1.1 billion, representing 31% of the full year plan,
and a decrease of 35% compared to gross issuance of $1.7 billion in the same period of FY14.

In line with the institutional reforms, a number of strategies were developed, updated or reviewed
in FY 15 to guide the WBG’s work. For instance the FY16 -18 planning followed a new strategic
process initiated in FY14, the W process. Improvements were noted along with challenges relating
to the transitional state in which several regional offices and the Global Practices (GPs) still
operates. For FY16 – 8, the World Bank (WB) is seeking to build a strong link with the SDG
agenda, the Financing for Development processes and outcomes, and the 2015 United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP21).

On the part of the IFC, the FY16-18 IFC Strategy and Business Outlook paper focused on the
medium-term strategic and business outlook for IFC seen within the context of a longer-term
vision for what IFC wants to achieve and how it wants to operate. IFC’s overall strategy within
the low momentum in global growth which is expected to continue in the medium term is to
continue to focus on contributing to the WBG strategy and goals.

On Expenditure Review (ER), which was adopted in December 2013, the target of the ER is a
reduction of WBG’s annual cost base at $418 million over 3 years, including a buffer of $18
million, with end goal of a leaner, more efficient institution and a financially stronger WBG, better
positioned to serve its clients.

With respect to the Program-for-Results (PforR) instrument introduced in January 2012,
Management carried out an initial review of experience with the new instrument after two years
of implementation. The review found that the PforR instrument has been successfully rolled out
across a broad range of countries and sectors, policy requirements have been met, and
implementation for all but one of the approved operations is broadly on track. Accordingly,
Management proposed to the Executive Directors to agree to a change in the five percent cap on
                                                 7
PforR Financing, and come back to the Board if and when the anticipated three year average
demand exceed 15 percent of total IBRD/IDA commitments. The other proposal was to agree on
a limited exception to the high-value procurement exclusion requirement under the PforR. The
Executive Directors broadly agreed with the two proposals with a proviso to address the issue of
heaviness and high cost in preparing PforR operations, which has restrained its adoption in many
countries.

The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard (WBG CSC), first published in April 2014, represent
the apex framework for monitoring and reporting contributions to the goals underpinning the WBG
Strategy. The WBG and WB CSCs were updated and discussed with Executive Directors in
October 2014. Important progress was reported especially in the area of incorporating citizen and
beneficiary feedback. Directors commended the progress to date. The next update of the WBG
CSC is scheduled for the 2015 Annual Meetings.

The WBG has made significant and commendable progress with the comprehensive review of its
procurement policy and procedures embarked upon since 2012. Taking into account the views and
opinions of external stakeholders and staff, the Bank, on April 12, 2013, presented a proposed new
framework for procurement in World Bank operations. An updated version is expected in
April/May at which point a board decision will be made.

The new Environmental and Social Standards Framework will replace current Safeguard policies.
The Staff team have consulted with various stakeholders. Although most of the standards are
acceptable at a general level, it remains important to study the updated framework which will be
released in July 2015, and assess how feasible and pro-development these standards and approach
are for our countries.

From billions to trillions is the theme for the DC Meeting at the 2015 Spring Meetings of the World
Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and five other MDBs In this
critical year, these, institutions have come together to explore and confirm what they can do, within
their respective institutional mandates, to support, and in particular finance, the eventual
achievement of the proposed post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014, brought to an end a four-year period of
stability around $105 per barrel and signaled an end to a price “supercycle”. Oil prices are
expected to remain low in 2015 and rise only marginally in 2016. This decline in oil prices no
doubt present a significant window of opportunity to reform energy taxes and fuel subsidies, which
are substantial in several developing countries, and reinvigorate reforms to diversify oil-reliant
economies.

As part of the reforms to strengthen Diversity and Inclusion (D&I), the senior management of the
WBG (SMT) signed a Diversity and Inclusion compact which outlines specific actions and targets
for which they will hold themselves accountable. The SMT Compact has been cascaded down to
all Vice Presidents, who are in the process of preparing their own D&I action plans. Inclusion will
be measured though the staff perceptions expressed through surveys.

As of December 2014, the Angolan portfolio comprised five (5) IDA investments projects,
representing a total net commitment of U$ 426 million, and one (1) MIGA guarantee of up to Euro
470 million (Hydropower Cambambe Project). As at March 31, 2015, the World Bank Group
commitment in Nigeria comprises US$ 5.947billion of IDA credits and US$300m Budget Support,
US$ 895 billion IBRD projects, US$ 1.395 billion of IFC, US$ 98 million of MIGA and US $19.4
million Global Environmental Facility (GEF) projects. While for South Africa, the US$3.75 billion
loan to Eskom Sector Investment Project (ESIP) remains the major IBRD operation, of which a
total of US$1.542 billion has been disbursed to date.

Following the agreement to conduct periodic IBRD and IFC Shareholding Reviews, every five
years, discussions have since commenced on the 2015 Review at the Executive Board. Currently,
there appeared to be no appetite or willingness for re-alignment of shares during this review.
Governors will be appropriately notified of this position at the 2015 spring meetings.

With respect to the Voice Secondment Program, an official from the South African Treasury is
currently participating in the 11th Cohort of the program which commenced in January 2015. A
call for nominations for the 12th Cohort has been circulated to the Capitals. Nominations will close
on Friday, May 15, 2015. The 12th Cohort of the Program will commence in January 2016 and
end in July, 2016.

Ahead of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis in July 2015 and towards the post
2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed Conference in New York in September
2015, the World Bank has stepped up its collaboration with the United Nations (UN) and other
Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).

Following an exchange with the Bank staff on curbing illicit financial flows and Base Erosion and
Profit Shifting (BEPS), the Sub-Saharan African Executive Directors at the Bank discussed options
and made recommendations to the management on how the institution could lend support to Africa
and to actions recommended in the report of AU/ECA the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial
Flows from Africa led by Former President Mbeki of South Africa.

On 25 February, 2015, the constituency office met a delegation of visiting South African
Engineers/CEOs delegation for an hour’s interactive session. The delegation visited the World
Bank and the IFC to learn more about the institutions, projects financed by the Bank Group in the
region, policies, standards and processes for procurement of technical services.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS


1.1    Overview

The global economy is still struggling to gain momentum as many high-income countries continue
to grapple with the negative effects of the 2008/09 global financial crisis while emerging markets
are less dynamic than in the recent past. In 2014, global growth was lower than initially expected,
continuing a pattern of disappointing outturns over several years, with a marginal increase to 2.6
percent, from the 2.5 percent in 2013.

Looking ahead, global growth is expected to rise moderately to 2.9 percent in 2015 and, on average
about 3.3 percent through 2017, supported by gradual recovery in high income countries, low oil
prices, and receding domestic headwinds in developing countries.



1.2    High Income Countries

In 2014, Growth in high income countries has picked up to 1.7 percent, from 1.4 percent in 2013,
but with increasingly divergent performance. While activity in the United States and the United
Kingdom has gathered momentum as labor markets heal and monetary policy remains extremely
accommodative, the recovery has been sputtering in the Euro area and Japan as legacies of the
financial crisis linger, intertwined with structural bottlenecks.

In Euro area, activity has been weaker than anticipated, especially in Germany, France, and Italy.
Impaired balance sheets and high unemployment (legacies of the global financial crisis) are
impacting on a fragile recovery and reducing the expected growth benefits from sustained low oil
prices. For 2015-17, the Euro area periphery is expected to contribute more to growth.

In Japan, at 0.2 percent, growth in 2014 fell significantly short of expectations as the economy
struggled to recover from a sales tax increase in April 2014 and subdued exports despite a weak
yen. Looking ahead, soft oil prices, labor market reforms and the announced additional monetary
stimulus by the Central Bank of Japan would support recovery, and growth is expected to reach
1.2 percent in 2015 and 1.6 percent in 2016.

1.3    Developing Countries

While China is undergoing a carefully managed slowdown, with the main challenge in shifting
from investment to consumption led growth, disappointing growth in other developing countries
in 2014 reflected weak external demand, but also domestic policy tightening, political uncertainties
and supply-side constraints.
                                                10
Deteriorating terms of trade and falling commodity prices dampened growth in commodity
exporters such as Russia, Venezuela and Angola. Policy uncertainty, social and labor tensions,
combined with slow progress in structural reforms dented confidence and contributed to slowdown
in Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, India and Mexico. Fiscal and monetary
policy tightening to contain credit growth or inflation and improve fiscal positions have adversely
impacted activity in Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey, Ghana and Zambia.

As the domestic headwinds that held back growth in 2014 ease and recovery strengthens in
developed countries, growth is expected to gradually accelerate beyond 2015.

1.4    Sub-Saharan Africa

Growth picked up moderately in SSA in 2014, to an average of 4.5 percent compared with 4.2
percent in 2013. GDP slowed markedly in South Africa, constrained by strikes in the mining sector,
electricity shortages and low investor confidence. Angola was set back by a decline in oil prices
and the Ebola outbreak severely disrupted output in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. By contrast,
in Nigeria, the region’s largest economy, activity expanded at a robust pace, supported by a
buoyant non-oil sector. Growth was also strong in many low income countries, including Cote
D’Ivoire, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Tanzania.

Looking ahead, with the recent forecast downgrades in Nigeria and Angola due to low persistent
oil prices, SSA is expected to contract its GDP growth in 2015 and starting recovery in 2016-17.

WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS


2.1    Overview

During the first half of FY15, World Bank Group commitment volume to client countries totaled
$30.1 billion, an increase of 34% over the first half of FY14. This overall increase was driven by
strong IBRD commitments, whose performance was at 66% of full year projection, and by a strong
IFC Mobilization at $3.9 billion versus $2.2 billion in FY14. As regards to disbursements, the total
WBG volume was flat at $22.9 billion, compared to December 2013.

2.2    IBRD Operations

For the first six months of FY15, loan commitments totaled $14.4 billion, over 2 times the amount
committed in the similar period of FY14. This increase was exceptionally high due to a strong
pipeline developed in the second half of FY14, following the increase in the Single Borrowing
Limit (SBL) and the strong Q1 ahead of new pricing measures effective October 1, 2014.Gross
disbursements during the first 6 months of FY15 were $11.7 billion in FY14, compared with $12.8
billion in FY13.



2.3    IDA Operations

IDA commitments, at end of Q2 FY15, stood at $5.8 billion, a decrease of 11% compared with
$6.5 billion in Q2 FY14. Gross disbursements of development credits and grants during the six
months of FY15 were $5.9 billion, an increase of $ 0.3 billion from FY14 YTD. In terms of
regional focus, Africa and South Asia together accounted for 75% of total gross disbursements
during the first semester of FY15.

The top five borrowers with the largest development credit outstanding, as of December 2014,
accounted for 50% of the commitments, and included India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam and
Nigeria. The African country’s development credit represented 5% of the IDA’s portfolio.

To increase IDA lending envelope to recipient countries, concessional partner loans were
introduced under IDA 17, by incorporating a limited amount of debt funding into the financing
framework ($4.4 billion). As of December 2014, IDA has signed loan agreements totaling $3.8
billion with four of the five partners and had received loan proceeds under two of those agreements
of $1.3 billion. As part of the overall arrangement, the money has been invested in a fixed return
instrument with the IFC.



                                                12
2.4    IFC Operations

In the first half of FY15, IFC total commitments were $8.9 billion, compared with $7.3 billion in
the first half of FY14, a decrease of 23%, of which $5.0 billion is from its own account and $3.9
through core mobilization. The Corporations’ total disbursed investment portfolio was $5.3 billion,
an increase of 18% over the same period in FY14, with $3.6 billion in loan portfolio, $1.2 billion
in equity portfolio, and $0.8 billion in debt security portfolio. From total commitments, 47% were
programs in IDA countries.

IFC is increasingly using its borrowings issuance as a tool to promote capital markets development
in emerging and frontier markets, which includes raising local currency funds. As of December
2014, $2.0 billion of non-US$ denominated market borrowings were outstanding, denominated in
Armenian drams, CFA francs, Chinese renminbi, Dominican pesos, Indian rupees, Nigerian naira,
Russian rubles, Rwandan francs and Zambian kwachas. Proceeds of such borrowings were
invested in local currencies, loans to clients and/or partially swapped into US dollars.



2.5    MIGA Operations

During the six months of FY15, MIGA issued 18 new guarantee contracts and additions to 5
existing contracts for a total of $1.1 billion, representing 31% of the full year plan, and a decrease
of 35% compared to gross issuance of $1.7 billion in the same period of FY14. Of the total new
issuance, 47% of projects were in priority areas, such as complex projects and those supporting
IDA countries. During that period, the Agency supported 7 new projects in Sub-Saharan Africa
(30% of the total issuance) amounting to $72 million, an increase from the 6 projects for $95
million accounted for in Q2 FY14.

As of December 2014, MIGA’s gross exposure to Sub-Saharan Africa totaled $3 billion (26.6%
of the portfolio), with most of the business concentrated in Infrastructure (mainly power sector)
which accounted for two thirds of the total exposure.

SELECTED WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAMS AND POLICIES


3.1     World Bank/IDA FY 16-18 Strategy & Business Outlook

In line with the institutional reforms, the FY16 -18 planning followed a new strategic process
initiated in FY14, the W process. Improvements were noted along with challenges relating to the
transitional state in which several regional offices and the Global Practices (GPs) still operates.

The strategy and business outlook is premised on 4 building blocks, strategic context, strategic
work program directions, financial sustainability, and business planning. For FY16 – 8, the World
Bank (WB) is seeking to build a strong link with the SDG agenda, the Financing for Development
processes and outcomes, and the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21.

Overall, the World Bank acknowledges the challenges posed by low momentum in global growth
which is expected to continue in the medium term, and the impact this will have in the attainment
of the WBG goals and targets set for 20301. It is expected that this constrained global economic
trajectory will result in further tightening of the financial conditions leading to moderation in
capital flows to developing countries. In response to this challenging environment, the WB has
decided to focus on scaling up services and building financial strength including financial products
for public and private sectors, knowledge services, and investment risk mitigation.

Operationally, the Bank prioritizes strong delivery with emphasis on IDA, increased focus on
poverty and shared prosperity, strengthening of the operating model and strengthening of diagnosis
and joint implementation2 plans, and improvements to internal processes to enhance knowledge
exchange, align trust funds to bank priorities, improve selectivity of areas of engagement, shift
the budget to favor client engagements (currently Country engagements get 53% of the budget,
14% goes to global engagements and 33% to program and practice management), and maintain
efficiencies initiated through the expenditure review process.

 The strategic work program will include accelerating work in IDA countries and prioritizing
transformational programs, expand work in MICs mainly through knowledge services and support
to countries with a growing demand for IBRD, responding to crisis and meeting commitments of
CCSA, enhancing program selectivity and program collaboration, and enhancing the efficiency of

  The WBG goal is to reduce poverty (number of people living on or under $1.25 a day) to 3% by 2030, and shared
prosperity (average real per capita income of the bottom 40%). Scenarios presented in the January 2015 edition of
the Global economic Prospect suggest that developing countries would need per capita growth of at least 4%
between 2015 and 2030 to achieve the 3% poverty goals.

  As part of the one World Bank Group, the four agencies, World Bank (IBRD and IDA), IFC and MIGA are
encouraged to cooperate closely in the field and have Joint Implementation Plans (JIP). The model emphasizing
joint programs is proving to be challenging at times, more lessons will emerge in the FY16-18 implementation
phase.

the advisory services. At the same time, the Bank is expected to scale down and be strategic on
global partnerships, reform the grant making facilities namely CGIAR (Consultative Group for
International Agriculture Research) and SPF (State and Peace Building Fund) to align to the
Bank’s work and improve accountability.

On financial sustainability, the CFO’s message is that the Bank’s financial outlook in the near term
is constrained, a steadily improving trajectory is expected beyond FY16, and that no action is
necessary on the part of shareholders.

The long term capital outlook is marked by considerable uncertainty due to sensitivity of income,
and the persisting low interest rate environment. Allocable net income for FY15 is expected to
range between $650 and $750 million (lower that the $750million projected in FY14 3 ). The
instituted “margins for maneuver” measures are expected to increase the revenue from loan spread
and increase lending capacity. At the same time, expenditure reviews are expected to start yielding
some savings- $106 million in FY16, $93 million in FY17, and $45 million in FY18. Despite these
measures, overall income is expected to remain constrained even with respect to meeting IDA 17
replenishment hence the proposal to transfer the bulk of the FY15 allocable net income into
surplus. Careful monitoring of the medium terms outlook and further updates to the Board are
expected.

SDR 33.5 billion (an equivalent of $50.5 billion) is available for IDA recipient countries, and as
of February 2015 SDR 5.3 billion have been released and are available for commitment. IDA
anticipates playing a critical role in the post-2015 agenda, and asserts that this will require adaptive
actions and building on its comparative advantages. A process to review development results, long
term vision and financial sustainability, and governance and reform of the IDA replenishment
process, has been set-up and will inform future directions.

External funds makes up a 1/3 on the Bank’s activities funding. The package includes trust funds
(TF 4 ) and reimbursable arrangements with client countries including Reimbursable Advisory
Services (RAS) and Reserves Advisory Management Program (RAMP). Focus in the FY16 – 18
will be placed on improving alignment, transparency and integration of external funds into
business planning processes, and ensuring financial sustainability. Added attention will put on
expanding reimbursable advisory services as well. These actions are expected to build on the
focused budget sustainability, budget process improvements including maintaining efficiencies
started with the expenditure review, and strategic reviews.

While Board members expressed support for the strategy there are still concerns that despite the
threat posed by low growth to the Bank goals, there is still no better understanding on how to

deliver growth or certainty on interventions most effective in improving the lives of the bottom
40%. Despite the increasing emergency responses provided for floods and hurricanes, Disaster
Risk Management (DRM) is not one of the priorities. The Bank was also urged to continue to
improve its support to MICs beyond RAS. The prioritization of IDA over reserves in the allocation
of net allocable income was scrutinized, as to whether it is the best way to strengthen the Bank and
even support IDA countries and as an area of concern given the lower level of reserves. The need
for clarity on how the implementation of safeguards and procurement policies will be financed
were also emphasized.



3.2    IFC Strategy and Business Outlook FY 16-18 Growing for Impact

The FY16-18 IFC Strategy and Business Outlook paper focused on the medium-term strategic and
business outlook for IFC seen within the context of a longer-term vision for what IFC wants to
achieve and how it wants to operate.

This is one of the key engagements in the annual World Bank Group (WBG) strategic planning,
budget and performance review (W) process build on conclusions of the strategic phase of the
planning process, and provide a platform for institution-specific Management teams and the Board.

IFC’s overall strategy within the low momentum in global growth which is expected to continue
in the medium term is to continue to focus on contributing to the WBG strategy and goals. Within
this context, IFC’s selectivity will be guided by opportunities that enable it to integrate impact and
financial sustainability, and where it can foster economic growth while responding to client demand
and addressing priorities emerging from the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country
Partnership Frameworks (CPFs).

IFC will explore emerging opportunities and frontiers where it can engage for greater impact in
addition to growth in established priority areas, including an even stronger focus on Fragile and
Conflict Situations and maintaining its IDA targets. Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Middle East
and North Africa are still key regions given poverty levels and particular challenges. In Middle Income
Countries, where 70% of the global extreme poor reside, IFC will remain highly selective in its
engagement. Work in sectors such as infrastructure, agribusiness, financial markets, health and
education continues to be important, and will benefit from increasing collaboration across the WBG,
including through new platforms such as the Global Infrastructure Facility, which will help to advance
the public-private partnerships (PPP) agenda. In addition, jobs (where the private sector has a critical
role to play), climate (where IFC is uniquely positioned to help clients address causes and effects of
climate change, including through programmatic initiatives and collaboration across the WBG), and
gender, continue to be important cross-cutting strategic themes.

IFC’s growth is critical to maximize its contribution to reaching the goals, especially in light
challenging external context, increasing risk aversion, and retrenchment by other IFIs from
emerging markets – business as usual will not be enough. The macro environment of slower
projected growth and rising inequality, and the changing financial landscape, increase the need
and opportunities for IFC. With global growth being below expectations, IFC recognizes that the
world in which it operates requires an urgent response from the private sector. As the largest global
                                                  16
development finance institution focused on the private sector, IFC can provide leadership, connect
supply of financing sources with demand and opportunities for investments, play a role in de-
risking emerging markets and stimulating growth through demonstration effects, and leverage
lessons of experience while diversifying risk IFC is not pursuing growth for growth’s sake, but
overall growth for both greater impact and financial sustainability. Although scale is important,
volume is an outcome and not a driving factor.

Managing IFC’s capital adequacy is crucial to the fulfilment of IFC’s mission. IFC needs to holds
sufficient capital to protect against unexpected losses and maintain its triple-A rating. IFC’s approach
to capital measurement and management is broadly aligned with global regulatory standards (the
“Basel Accord”) and with the methodologies of the rating agencies. However, IFC has to constantly
keep abreast of changes of methodology and to identify any potential threat to its triple-A rating.

For FY 15, IFC is on track to generate gross expenditure review savings at or above the planned level
for FY15. In the first half of FY15, IFC has re-invested all of these savings in its operations while still
managing to decrease expenses. However, IFC may request a modest nominal budget increase in FY16,
which includes consideration for inflation. This increase will support strong program growth and
enable prudent portfolio management in a time of great market uncertainty.

For the IFC, there are two major challenges to achievement of the WBG goals: weak, below-trend
growth and rising inequality. IFC together with the whole WBG and its development partners, will
need to: (i) offer growth solutions, in particular to allow untapped human potential, which exists
everywhere, to be realized; and (ii) help to open up technological frontiers for all. In order to fulfill
its mission and make a lasting and significant impact on achieving the goals, while also trying to
maximize its current capacity, IFC will need to grow and shape its capabilities in human and
financial capital as well as its more intangible convening power and influence. IFC will need to
grow key elements of its capacity:

    •   Intellectual capacity – strategic staffing which meets current gaps as well as anticipating
        emerging
    •   new needs; and thought leadership to support growth of the private sector.
    •   Leverage capacity – working with clients and partners, and developing new relationships
        and ways to mobilize resources for development.
    •   Financial capacity – generating sufficient returns on investments and managing financial
        resources effectively to allow for capital growth. These efforts need to start now, as they
        will take time. IFC will refine its ideas about this longer-term outlook and strategy for IFC
        over the next few months – this is an ongoing process IFC expects to undertake and will
        look to engage with the Board.

3.3    Expenditure Review Update

The objective of the Expenditure Review (ER), adopted in December 2013 under the change
process at the WBG, is to reduce the WBG’s cost base through efficiency measures that also reduce
complexity, thereby contributing to IBRD net income and lending capacity, supplementing IDA
commitment authority, and increasing the efficiency of the external fund use.

The ER is also expected to contribute to longer term budget discipline by informing the broader
strategy and performance review process and more generally to help improve organizational
effectiveness.

The target of the ER is a reduction of WBG’s annual cost base at $418 million over 3 years,
including a buffer of $18 million, with end goal of a leaner, more efficient institution and a
financially stronger WBG, better positioned to serve its clients.

The ER has been a Bank Group exercise, with each organization contributing. Across the Bank
Group, the savings target represents approximately 8% of total spend, of which 9% at IBRD/IDA,
5% at IFC and 3% at MIGA. The savings identification phase was completed in January 2015 and
savings have been either clawed back (FY15) or embedded into indicative FY16-18 budget
trajectories. In FY15, approximately $74 million were clawed back from the IBRD/IDA budget,
and $31 million from IFC.

The ER program targeted general and administrative (G&A) costs while seeking to minimize
impact on financial and advisory services to clients. Efforts were also made to minimize the impact
on staff numbers, estimated to be in the range of $130 to $145 million, approximately one-third of
the gross savings.

The implementation of savings measures is underway. A monitoring and evaluation framework
has been established to track and validate savings, monitor progress against milestones, provide a
regular feedback loop to the budget process, collect information for institutional reporting, and
support regular and ad hoc analysis of key topics. To date, savings have been recorded in some
elements of the board budget and administrative costs. Significant savings were made on travel
costs


3.4    Program for Results: Two Year Review

In January 2012, the World Bank Group introduced a new financing instrument, Program-for-
Results (PforR) Financing, to complement the Development Policy Financing (DPF) and
Investment Project Financing (IPF) it already provided. The PforR instrument has the following
features: (i) finance and support borrowers’ programs of expenditures and activities; (ii) disburse
against achievement of program results rather than against inputs; (iii) focus on strengthening
                                                18
institutional capacity to implement the program; and (iv) provide assurance that the Bank’s
financing is used appropriately and that the environmental and social impacts of the program are
adequately addressed.

Management committed to carry out an initial review of experience with the new instrument after
two years of implementation to: (i) assess the early experience with the design and implementation
of PforR operations and challenges faced by borrowers, development partners and Bank staff, and
(ii) identify emerging early lessons and recommend any proposed changes that would strengthen
the instrument.

Management has had two discussions with the Executive Directors at the CODE on the Two Year
Review, one (November 2013) to discuss the scope and methodology of the review, and the other
(October 2014) to look at the findings and comments of the Independent External Panels of
Experts. In addition, Management consulted further with Executive Directors to arrive at the final
recommendation paper that was discussed in April 9, 2015.

Consultations on the preliminary findings of the review were carried out with PforR teams in
government, development partners, civil society organizations, the private sector and others
stakeholders in the 15 countries that have used the instrument.

The review found that the PforR instrument has been successfully rolled out across a broad range
of countries and sectors, policy requirements have been met, and implementation for all but one
of the approved operations is broadly on track. Those who have used the instrument have positive
opinions, and findings suggest there is interest in the instrument among those who have not yet
used it. The paper concludes that no major changes in the design of the instrument are necessary
at this stage but some adjustments and areas of improvements have been identified. The challenges
identified included: how best to define and agree on Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs), the
articulation and application of the Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACGs), the impact of exclusions
in high value contracts, and the heaviness of the instrument

Based on the findings and with a view to respond to the demand by clients, Management proposed
to the Executive Directors to agree to a change in the five percent cap on PforR Financing, and
come back to the Board if and when the anticipated three year average demand exceed 15 percent
of total IBRD/IDA commitments. The other proposal was to agree on a limited exception to the
high-value procurement exclusion requirement under the PforR.

The Executive Directors broadly agreed with the two proposals, with most of them concurring that
the five percent cap is indeed a major constraint to the development of an instrument that is critical
to the implementation of the WBG strategy and vital in creating institutional capacity to address
the pressing challenges in client countries. Many Directors however, advised Management to move
more cautiously and invest in enhanced quality assurance and risk management for PforR given
                                                 19
the novelty of the instrument and the fact that it was not yet fully tested. Some Directors have also
stressed the need for PforR to reflect changes in the procurement and safeguards frameworks, and
touched upon the importance to focus on the outreach and communication to deepen knowledge
of the instrument by the various stakeholders. Directors have also urged Management to address
the issue of heaviness and high cost in preparing PforR operations, which has restrained its
adoption in many countries.


3.5    World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard

The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard (WBG CSC), first published in April 2014, represent
the apex framework for monitoring and reporting contributions to the goals underpinning the WBG
Strategy. The WBG CSC aggregates the contributions of all the institutions within the WBG
namely: the World Bank (WB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). In 2014, WB and IFC revised their Scorecards while
MIGA developed a Scorecard to replace its Key Performance Indicators (KPI), following the same
structure and objectives as the WBG CSC. The Scorecards are living documents to be adapted and
improved based on experience with Implementation and the evolving external and internal
environments.

The group scorecards are structured in three tiers: Tier I: The Goals and Development Context tier
provides an overview of progress on key development challenges faced by WBG client countries;
Tier II: The Results tier reports on key sectoral and multi-sectoral results achieved by clients
implementing operations supported by the WBG; and Tier III: The Performance tier captures
measures of operational and organizational effectiveness. In line with the WBG Strategy,
indicators in the first two tiers are grouped into three categories: growth, inclusiveness, and
sustainability/resilience. Scorecard indicators are disaggregated by gender, and fragile, conflict
and violence-affected situations (FCV), where feasible.

The Scorecards have evolved into accountability and management tools that provide feedback to
the Senior Management on WBG’s progress toward the goals and Strategy. Since the publication
of the WBG/WB Scorecards, relevant indicators have been cascaded to Memoranda of
Understanding with Senior Management and from there to relevant business units, to promote
accountability and broad ownership. The senior management has committed to update the
scorecards annually. The WBG and WB CSCs were updated and discussed with Executive
Directors in October 2014, while Tier III of the CSC were updated and discussed with Executive
Directors at a Technical Briefing on March 19 and an Informal board Meeting on April 9 ahead of
the Spring Meetings. At the last informal briefing to the Board, important progress was reported
especially in the area of incorporating citizen and beneficiary feedback. Directors commended the
progress to date and called for expedited action in particular in the clients’ rating for Bank
Advisory work and the remaining placeholders. The next update of the WBG CSC is scheduled
for the 2015 Annual Meetings.

3.6       Update on the Reform of World Bank Procurement Policy

The WBG has made significant and commendable progress with the comprehensive review of its
procurement policy and procedures embarked upon since 2012. The reform was occasioned by the
global changes and the need for the WBG to better support client countries to strengthen their
public procurement systems. Taking into account the views and opinions of external stakeholders
and staff, the Bank, on April 12, 2013, presented a proposed new framework for procurement in
World Bank operations to the Board Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE). The
proposed framework includes a vision, guiding principles, a strategy for implementation, and
amendments to operating policies and procedures that govern the Bank’s principal financing
instrument, i.e. investment lending. Management has concluded plans to present the framework
for the implementation of the reviewed procurement policy to CODE in due course.

The vision statement proposed: “Procurement in Bank operations supports clients to achieve value
for money in delivering results”, seeks to maximize development results by continuing to be a
global advocate for good procurement, while supporting clients to strengthen their procurement
systems. The guiding principles will underpin the overarching goal of achieving value for money.
The principles are consistent with international best practice and include economy, efficiency,
effectiveness, integrity, openness and transparency, and fairness.

For each investment operation, the Bank will agree with respective borrowers on the specific
procurement arrangements that will apply, consistent with the guiding principles of its policy. This
could imply more flexibility in the procurement rules, relying on the country methods and
procedures where respective conditions have been met.

Though some clients might wish to use the Bank’s revised procurement system, this would no
longer be mandatory for all Bank-financed projects. The Bank envisages that the procedures and
methods contemplated in its current guidelines, standard bidding documents and other templates,
and related products would be part of a new “Public Procurement Tool Box” to be deployed in
accordance with country conditions, the profile of the Bank’s country program, and the particular
needs and risks of the operation. The toolbox will also include training material and guidance on
improving country procurement systems and incorporating new and innovative procurement
methods and techniques as well as best practices worldwide.

During a recent informal briefing on the reform process, staff presented the new procurement
planning and tracking system (STEP). The presentation highlighted a value proposition including:

      -   Life cycle tracking (records all contracts and tracks all performance)
      -   Risk identification (identifies risk at activity level)
      -   Integrity scanning (verifies supplier eligibility and reduces risks of ineligible payments)
      -   Bidding information (captures competition data and market analysis)
      -   Transparency (automates publication of data and enables open contracting)
      -   Legacy integration (enhances data migration and stages future integration); and

                                                   21
      -   Monitoring and reporting (which simplifies access to data and enhances analytics).

Implementation arrangement is expected to be facilitated by:
    - Continuous guidance and support from Governance Global Practices (GGP)
    - System requirements completed with ITS and GGP
    - Rollout approach will be based on WBG and Client systems to STEP
    - Data transfer facility which will help clients adapt their systems to STEP.
Client engagement plan under the implementation arrangement will address capacity constraint

We are broadly in support of the proposed key components in the review of the World Bank
procurement policy including expanding the options of clients on procurement process;
recognition of country systems where the exist including addressing context specific challenges or
weaknesses dynamically and systematically; client capacity building for sustainable procurement
system; and the introduction of flexible principles and guidelines for PPPs, NCBs and ICBs. The
new elements introduced to the policy along with expected supportive capacity building, makes it
necessary for the Bank to reflect on how the policy roll-out will be financed. An updated version
is expected in April/May at which point a board decision will be made.



3.7       Policy reforms: Environmental and Social Standards Framework

The new Environmental and Social Standards Framework will replace current Safeguard policies,.
The Bank’s safeguard policies are a set of guidelines and conditions determining considerations to
be made prior to project implementation to ensure that potentially adverse human, social and
environmental consequences are identified and managed. These standards are used by the Bank
team, management and board to determine whether investments do no harm in respective contexts,
and whether they can be supported by the Bank.

As part of the operations reforms, the Bank has introduced new budget planning and management
processes, new instruments for engagement with countries, i.e. systematic country diagnosis and
(SCD) and country partnership framework (CPF). The review of Safeguards, together with the
procurement policy review, is intended to improve the ways in which the Bank projects takes into
account all the likely social and environmental impacts at planning and during implementation.
The reform of the safeguard policies is also intended to respond to both clients and donor concerns
relating to implementation difficulties and reputational concerns in some areas.

The new framework brings together the 8 safeguard policies into one policy and procedure with
10 standards, namely (1) assessment and management of ESS risks and impacts, (2) labor and
working conditions, (3) resource efficiency and pollution prevention, (4) community health and
safety, (5) land acquisition, restrictions of land use, and involuntary resettlement, (6) biodiversity
conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources, (7) indigenous people, (8)
cultural heritage, (9) financial intermediaries, and (10) information disclosure and stakeholder

                                                 22
engagement. Respect for human rights and the sustainability priorities are integrated at a high
level and thus embedded across all standards.

Approach-wise, the framework seeks to create a balance for strong oversight with borrower’s long
term responsibility (responsibility for adhering to the standards is not only at the beginning of the
project but is monitored until project completion) for the set standards. Unlike the previous
standards that treated a country as a unit of operation, these ones focus on the project area, with a
belief that the standards could easily influence other regional or national practices.

Following a discussion with the Board Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE), the
responsible team have consulted with various stakeholders including client and donor counties,
international organizations, CSOs, indigenous people and LGBT right groups, and specific
thematic experts. As part of the consultations, the WB team visited numerous African countries
including Nigeria in our constituency and also discussed the framework with the African Finance
Ministers and the caucus meeting in Khartoum. The key issue of concern for African Governors
relates to Environmental Safety Standard 7 – Indigenous people. Several countries (including both
signatories and non-signatories to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People) see the
standard as divisive and likely to fuel conflicts in their countries and thus called on the Bank to
find other ways to promote inclusion. At the same time, the push-back from indigenous people
rights groups has left Bank team at a slightly undecided position, a compromise is expected.
Although the Bank will have to take directives from its governors, the African position on the
indigenous people standard was also complicated by the African Union Commission on the Rights
of the Indigenous People who informed the Bank that the standard should stand, is in line with the
African Union position.

Overall, three standards on which strong opposing views have been registered are labor,
indigenous people and human rights. There is also no clear consensus on the use of borrower’s
systems, adaptive risk management approach, ESS on bio-diversity, climate change, and on
resources for implementing these detailed standards.

It will cost the bank or borrowers more to implement these standards, although one of the
motivation for the review was improving efficiencies. The cost element will be addressed in the
second phase of the discussions. Concerns from borrowers is that these costs should not be passed
on to projects.

 Although most of the standards are acceptable at a general level, it remains important to study the
updated framework which will be released in July 2015, and assess how feasible and pro-
development these standards and approach are for our countries. Issues still requiring some deeper
reflection and even input from Capitals where possible include questions on whether emphasis on
emissions curb and GhG accounting exclude most of the investments required in the region, what
the implications for setting standards for sub-contractors are for us as borrowers.

3.8    From Billion to Trillions –Transforming Development Finance- Post 2015 Financing
for Development –Multilateral Development Finance

From billions to trillions is the theme for the DC Meeting at the 2015 Spring Meetings of the World
Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The DC discussion note is the
joint product of the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development
Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank Group. In this critical year for
development, these Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the IMF have come together to
explore and confirm what they can do, within their respective institutional mandates, to support,
and in particular finance, the eventual achievement of the proposed post-2015 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).

The Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD) in Addis Ababa in July
2015 will be an important milestone in the post-2015 global effort to achieve universal and
sustainable development, underpinning the expected adoption of the SDGs at the United Nation
(UN) Special Summit for Sustainable Development in New York in September. This trajectory
will continue with the WBG/IMF Annual Meetings in Lima in October, and with the 21st
Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change in Paris in December, which seeks a new international agreement on climate change. In
sum, 2015 will create a platform to support global development aspirations for the next 15 years.

The DC Note proposes a preliminary vision for the collective role of these MDBs and the IMF
looking toward to the Addis FFD Conference and beyond. Guidance is being sought from
Development Committee members, including shareholders from each of the institutions, on how
the MDBs and the IMF might best cooperate with respect to their individual and shared
responsibilities and activities to support country clients in financing the Sustainable Development
Goals.

The main focus of the Discussion Note is transforming development finance. The paper posits that
to meet the investment needs of the SDGs, the global community needs to move the discussion
from “Billions” in ODA to the “Trillions” in investments of all kinds: public and private, national
and global, in both capital and capacity. Globally, achieving the proposed SDGs will require the
best possible use of each grant dollar, beginning with some US$135 billion in ODA. Yet flows for
development include philanthropy, remittances, South-South flows and other official assistance,
and foreign direct investment—together these amount to nearly US$1 trillion that needs to be used
just as effectively.

The paper argues that the most substantial development spending will take place at the national
level in the form public resources, while the largest potential is from private sector business,
finance and investment. This is the trajectory from billions to trillions, which each country and the
global community must support together to finance and achieve the transformative vision of the
SDGs.

A paradigm shift on how development will be financed is required to unlock the resources from
all sources public and private needed to achieve the SDGs. The world needs intelligent
development finance that goes well beyond filling financing gaps and that can be used strategically
                                                 24
to unlock, leverage, and catalyze private flows and domestic resources. Official Development
Assistance (ODA) will remain an important source of external public financing for Low-Income
Countries (LICs) on the basis of their vulnerability and low fiscal capacity. In the future, however,
ODA must be targeted increasingly to crowd-in other funding sources including enabling DRM.
Specific country case studies to identify the diverse financing sources to fund the implementation
of the SDGs for each country would be conducted by the WBG.

Specifically, the main role of the MDBs and IMF will be to:

       i.      Contribute to legal and policy reforms and programs to improve the investment
               climate at the interface of the public and private sectors
       ii.     Act as technical advisers and as honest brokers between commercial interests and
               policy makers.
       iii.    Build platforms connecting private sector corporations and financial institutions
               with policy makers and official agencies, to identify and put in place or revise most
               important policies
       iv.     Identify areas of market failures or areas where markets are yet non-existent. And
               then structure commercially viable projects in these areas.


The paper was discussed by the Directors and they generally welcomed and commended this
unprecedented collective efforts on the part of the MDBs and the IMF to support client countries
in financing the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In particular, EDs inter alia sought
additional clarity on the specifics of what the World Bank Group would bring to the table in this
joint effort and how the MDBs will collaborate with OECD-G20 to facilitate effective global
action that would restrict, stem, and reverse the tide of cross-border illicit flows. The paper was
revised to incorporate some of the inputs of Directors. The paper will be presented to Governors
to seek additional guidance at the plenary of the DC at Spring Meeting.


3.9    Financing for Development and the Future of IDA

IDA hosted two seminars in this financial year. One titled Update on Dialogue on Future
Directions for IDA (Dec 2014) and the held in March 2015 under the heading of Development
Finance Update: Financing for Development and the future of IDA. In the first seminar IDA put
emphasis on why business as usual is not enough (to end poverty in 2030), the spread of poverty
across LICs and MICs, and the comparative advantages of IDA. The proposed four strategic
directions were (1) deepening engagement to end poverty in IDA clients by strengthening impact
in FCS, ensuring robust access to concessional finance to LICs, and maximizing the use of WBG
knowledge as a platform for customized client engagement; (2) Scale up support for building
resilience and addressing vulnerability and safeguarding IDA’s capacity to deliver critical support
in the event of shocks; (3) tackle poverty pockets in IDA graduating countries and enhance
capacity to address vulnerability in IDA allocations; and (4) maximize leveraging and partnership
with private sector by optimizing synergies between IBRD-IDA-IFC-MIGA. On the financing
options, IDA presented five options. These are (1) strong replenishment to meet client demand,

                                                 25
(2) diversify risk management tools for tailored client solutions, (3) complement IDA with IDA-
plus to scale up client support, (5) mobilize private resources for development finance and optimize
financial instruments, and (6) review the WBG capacity to serve different client segments.

The second seminar placed IDA strategic propositions within the Financing for Development
discourse. Emphasis is on attaining the two goals, SDGs, and the need for intelligent post-2015
development financing that goes beyond filling gaps but unlocks, leverage and catalyze private
flows and domestic resources. The proposed policy directions are (1) deepen engagement to end
poverty in IDA countries; (2)scale up support for resilience and vulnerability, (3) facilitate access
to non-concessional financing for transition countries to tackle unfinished poverty agenda, and (4)
maximize leveraging and partnership with private sector.

The financing strategy acknowledges a constrained IBRD’s capacity in the near term, and proposes
the leveraging of IDA’s equity to address the increasing financing needs and increase impact of
WB investments, and use of non-concessional financing to supplement concessional financing to
serve IDA clients5.

The Executive Directors’ discussion focused mainly on the financing strategies, in particular the
proposed use of the IDA equity and the proposed non concessional window also referred to as
IDA-plus. While the African chair emphasized the need to ensure availability of resources for
LICs, maintenance of the core concessional window and also expressed support for an IDA plus
piloting, there were significant number of Chairs that recommended a detailed deliberation at
Deputies meeting, and those who challenged the use of IDA equity for lending, and the creation
of a non-concessional window. Overall, IDA team was requested to do further analysis, ascertain
that available instruments cannot address the gaps, demonstrate complementarity of instruments
instead of substitution, reflect the future needs and also acknowledge possible supply constraints,
and not to rush the strategy formulation. It is expected that the outcomes of the Deputies discussion
will inform the next IDA proposal and discussion with the Board.

Overall, using the Financing for Development agenda as a context for IDA strategies forces a more
ambitious approach which may not be realistic.



3.10     Understanding the Plunge in Oil Prices

The sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014, brought to an end a four-year period of
stability around $105 per barrel. The decline, which is much larger than that of the non-oil
commodity price indices compared to early-2011 peaks, possibly signaled an end to a price
“supercycle”. Oil prices are expected to remain low in 2015 and rise only marginally in 2016.



5
 For this, options include IDA liquidity used for borrowing, IDA debt issuance in the capital markets, and non-
concessional borrowing from partners.
                                                         26
Given the numerous intervening factors, the sources and implications of the sharp decline in oil
prices this time around have led to intensive debate. Executive Directors have had series of
engagement on this issue and this subject will also form the topic of discussion among Governors
at the forthcoming DC Lunch at the Spring meetings. The focus of the discussion and the paper
revolves around the assessment of the magnitude, drivers, and implications of the recent oil price
drop and its implications on both oil producing and exporting countries. Specifically, the following
questions would be addressed:

   o   How does the recent decline in oil prices compare with previous episodes?
   o   What are the causes of the sharp drop?
   o   What are the macroeconomic and financial implications of a sustained decline in oil prices?
   o   What are the main policy implications?

Numerous reasons have been adduced for the decline. These include; technological developments
made possible to reduce the intensity of oil consumption and to extract oil from various offshore
fields and non-conventional sources; the unwinding of some geopolitical risks that threatened
oil production; greater than anticipated supply and less than anticipated demand; OPEC decision
to maintain its market share and change its policy objectives from targeting an oil price band to
maintaining market share; as well as US Dollar appreciation against major currencies in the second
half of 2014 which negatively impacted the price of oil as demand declined in countries that
experienced an erosion in the purchasing power of their currencies.

Overall, the immediate macroeconomic implication of the decline in oil prices are many. If
sustained, declines tend to generate changes in real income befitting oil-importers and losses
hurting oil-exporters. These effects could vary considerably across countries and over time.

If prices remain low, over time, such decline tend to support economic activity and reduce
inflationary, external, and fiscal pressures in oil-importing countries. On the other hand, it would
affect oil-exporting countries adversely by weakening fiscal and external positions and reducing
economic activity. Low oil prices affect investor sentiment about oil-exporting emerging market
economies, and can lead to substantial volatility in financial markets, as already occurred in some
countries in the last quarter of 2014. However, Executive Directors all agreed that declining oil
prices also present a significant window of opportunity to reform energy taxes and fuel subsidies,
which are substantial in several developing countries, and reinvigorate reforms to diversify oil-
reliant economies.


3.11   Diversity and Inclusion Update

 As part of the reforms and the strengthening of HR tools, at the beginning of the FY15, the World
Bank HR VP, presented an update paper on Diversity and Inclusion (D&I). The paper built on
previous commitments, reaffirmed the HR agenda on diversity and inclusion, and proposed a
broader approach that promotes shared responsibility between the HR and managers. Emphasis is
put on creating an organizational culture that fosters diversity and inclusion, and embedding D&I
considerations in recruitment, learning, mentoring, retention and continuous monitoring. The
priority areas on which the HR will continue to report remains the nationality, gender and race.
Indicators of women managers, women in GF-GG position, Part II managers, and SSA/CR

                                                27
continue to be monitored along with a broad reporting on the Nationalities of Focus, and on
diversity of academic institutions.

Drilling down on FY Q2 performance, of the three agencies, the SSA/CR score is lowest in MIGA,
and in operations it is lower in IG&A services and in Climate change CCSA.

The renewed framework puts emphasis on advocacy, accountability, inclusion –invest in creating
an inclusive environment for leadership team and all WBG staff. As part of accountability
measures, senior management of the WBG (SMT) signed a Diversity and Inclusion compact which
outlines specific actions and targets for which the will hold themselves accountable The SMT
Compact has been cascaded down to all Vice Presidents, who are in the process of preparing their
own D&I action plans. The indicators include a target of 12.5% of SSA/CR GF+; 50% of women
at GF+ - technical; 50% for part II managers, and 50% women managers. Inclusion will be
measured though the staff perceptions expressed through surveys. A value of 79 for dignity and
respect, 53 for openness and trust, 76 for non-discrimination; 74 for commitment to D&I. 76 for
diverse perspectives and 52 for accountability. The FY15 staff survey will encourage staff to also
self-identify along the race and sexual orientation lines, so as to generate data and assess the levels
of inclusion overtime.
To strengthen advocacy, staff volunteers were invited to serve as D&I Advocates in their VPUs.
The advocates are expected to work with their management teams to integrate D&I into the fabric
of the organization by raising issues, assisting with specific initiatives, monitoring trends, and
sharing information on corporate initiatives and best practices. This team together with VP, receive
support from the External Advisory Panel, which will serve as a conduit between the Bank Group
and the global community, serve as a sounding board and advise on matters relating to diversity
and inclusion.

•   The HR VP is being encouraged to continue to monitor all indicators, adequately resource the
    Talent Desk for recruitment and retention of African, Caribbean, and African American staff,
    and monitor how D&I ratios are impacted by the reforms and strategic staffing process. As
    part of the targeted recruitment of Africans, the Bank plans to undertake a recruitment
    mission(s) to Africa in FY16.

CONSTITUENCY COUNTRIES’ PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS


4.1 Angola

Strategy with the World Bank Group

The joint IBRD/IDA/IFC/MIGA Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Republic of Angola
for FY14-FY16, designed to support Angola’s transition to a full-fledged Middle-Income Country
was approved in September 2013. The CPS is aligned with Angola’s National Development Plan
(2013-2017) and the Strategy to Combat Poverty (2010-2015), and is anchored in the strategic
pillars of: (i) economic diversification, (ii) enhancement of service delivery and social protection,
and (iii) improvement of capacity to shocks and resilience. Portfolio size and composition

Portfolio size and composition

As of December 2014, the Angolan portfolio comprised five (5) IDA investments projects,
representing a total net commitment of U$ 426 million, and one (1) MIGA guarantee of up to Euro
470 million (Hydropower Cambambe Project). All five IDA projects were carried over from FY14,
including the project “Learning for all”, the last IDA credit of U$ 75 million which was approved
by the Board in FY14, alongside with the CPS. Total cumulative disbursements are slowly
improving, standing currently at U$ 138 million, corresponding to 32% of the total net
commitments.

The IDA portfolio comprises projects in the following areas: 1 project in Water, Sanitation and
Flood Protection 41.5%, 2 projects in Human development (Education and Health) 34%, 1 project
in Public Sector and Decentralization 19.2%, and 1 project in Agriculture and Rural Development
5%.

Projects in Pipeline


Angola has graduated to IBRD on July 1, 2014 and is currently negotiating its first Development
Policy Financing with the Bank, a second institutional support to the water sector, and an
investment loan to benefit smallholder’s farmers. The country is also considering other instruments
of assistance, including Knowledge-based services and guarantees aimed at helping the country
improve social indicators, and address its developmental agenda. The MIGA guarantee for the
Lauca Hydropower is expected to be discussed at the Board soon.

4.2    Nigeria

Strategy with the World Bank Group

The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nigeria covers the period 2014-2017 and aims
to support the implementation of the Government’s Vision 20:2020 and to support the
Transformation Agenda’s goal of laying the foundation for socially and regionally inclusive
economic growth. The CPS was prepared in the context of the World Bank Group’s renewed
commitment to the twin goals. The new CPS builds on the achievements and lessons learnt from
the implementation of the 2010-2013 program. The CPS organizes the Bank’s interventions around
three strategic clusters namely:

       The federally-led structural reform agendas for growth and jobs: the agenda seeks to
       foster diversified growth and job creation by addressing two key constraints: power and


                                                30
       access to finance; it targets agriculture as one of key drivers of economy, holding a strong
       promise of improving livelihoods in rural areas.

       The Quality and Efficiency of Social Service Delivery at State Level: the CPS program
       will focus on developing more effective systems for social delivery (social protection
       programs, education, health, and water services delivery) to help address inequities in
       income and opportunities.

       Governance and Public Sector Management: the CPS aims at strengthening public
       finance management and public investment management. It is hoped that savings gained
       from improved public sector efficiency will help efforts to promote inclusive growth. The
       CPS integrates gender, equity and conflict sensitivity as essential elements of governance.


Portfolio Size and Composition

As at March 31, 2015, the World Bank Group commitment in Nigeria comprises US$ 5.947billion
of IDA credits and US$300m Budget Support, US$ 895 billion IBRD projects, US$ 1.395 billion
of IFC, US$ 98 million of MIGA and US $19.4 million Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
projects. The Bank Group portfolio consists of 27 IDA projects, 2 IBRD Project, 13 IFC
Investments & 5 Advisory Services, 12 MIGA projects and 3 GEF projects. The IDA portfolio is
well aligned with the recently approved CPS for the country and the Federal Government strategy,
including the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA). The bulk of IDA support is in the area
of Agriculture, Transport and ICT, Health and Human Development and Social Protection, as
indicated in the sectoral composition discussed below.


Sector Breakdown of Portfolio (IDA, IBRD, GEF):

Nigeria’s portfolio as at March 31, 2015 comprises projects in 4 development sectors including
sustainable development (power, transport, urban development, agriculture, and environment)
USUS$3.4 billion or 55.6%; human development (health, education and social protection)
US$1.677 billion or 27.3%; finance and private sector (employment, PPP and Mortgage Finance)
US$575 or 9.4%; and Poverty reduction and economic management (governance reform DPO)
US$480million or 7.8%. (See Figure 1 below).


Disbursements (IDA, IBRD, GEF):

The portfolio has a cumulative disbursement of US$ 2.398 billion from 26 projects representing
40 % of total commitment to date. One project which became effective in February 2015 after
approval in April 2014, is yet to disburse any amount. Concerted efforts are required to ensure that
the implementation takes off, in view of the reintroduction of commitment charges by Bank on
undisbursed balances for all categories of projects.
                                                31
Figure 1




Portfolio Quality (IDA, IBRD, GEF)

Nigeria portfolio quality has continued to improve in the last few years. Better project management
including commitments to standards, quality of delivery, more efficient collaboration between staff
and clients, improved supervision and continuous monitoring and evaluation are responsible for
this upward swing. There is an ongoing effort to ensure strong fiduciary controls in project
management. The challenge, however, is slow disbursement, hampering efforts to accelerate the
delivery or results on the ground.


Pipeline Projects (IDA, IBRD, GEF)

The Nigeria IDA FY15 delivery is $1.075billion. Polio and Routine Immunization Additional
Financing ($200m) was delivered in early April. The pipeline projects are: Health (Program to
support save one million lives, $500m); Agriculture DPO1 ($100m); Macro Economics/Fiscal
Management (Second Edo State Growth and Employment Support Credit, $75million; Lagos
DPO3, $200m). In addition, an education project supported by the Global Partnership for
Education, valued at $100m, is expected to be approved in April.

The new federal level budget support operation ($1bn) is under preparation.

FY16 lending pipeline includes the Staple Crop Processing zones Support Project, Social Safety
Net project, Electricity Transmission Project (IBRD) and Public Financial Management Reform
and Performance Project. See full list in Annex II.

Strategy with the World Bank Group
The South Africa World Bank 2014 – 2017 country Partnership Strategy (CPS) identifies three
areas of focus (the 3 pillars) namely (1) reducing inequality, (2) promoting investment, and (3)
strengthening investments.
The CPS also highlights that the knowledge hub will be the primary vehicle for delivering
development solutions, support to the regional integration agenda will be a key part of the CPS,
and that financing of knowledge services will come from the Bank’s internal resources.


Portfolio Size and Composition
The World Bank lending program in South Africa comprised four core operations funded by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Global Environment Facility grants.
These projects are:
•     Eskom Investment Support Project, 8 April 2010 (US$3.75 billion),
      • The Isimangaliso Wetland Park project, 3 Dec 2009 (US$9 million),
      • Eskom Renewables Support, 27 Oct 2011 (US$250 million),
      • Durban Landfill Gas-to- electricity project, 11 June 2004
With respect to the IFC, the committed and outstanding portfolio in South Africa consisted of 28
partnerships at the end of FY14. The sectors covered through the total portfolio include
manufacturing, financial services, agriculture/agribusiness, health, and municipal infrastructure.
Five projects were approved in FY14 for or a total of $396.74 million. These were in partnership
with CLN South Africa, Sasfin Holdings, and African Bank Investment Limited. The January 2015
report shows 11 active investments.
With respect MIGA, the agency continues to engage with the State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) and
with the private sector in South Africa. There has been talks about recruiting an
underwriter/business originator in South Africa to improve awareness of MIGA products and
enhance access to the organization from Johannesburg.
Other programs and partnerships underway include:

      •   Debt management
      •   Support to the GEPF/PIC– Pension Investment Advisory.
      •   Financial Sector Development and Reform Program:
      •   Reimbursable Advisory services (RAS) to the Department of Land Reform and Rural
          Development.
      •   The knowledge Hub currently include. Initiatives facilitated by the Bank and packaged
          as Knowledge Hub currently include the cross-border TB project and a policy dialogue
          with the Department of Education.
Pipeline:
on the pipeline, a Land Bank Financial intermediation Loan is expected to go to the board before
the end of this financial year.

Contribution to IDA and WBG Trust Funds
For IDA 17, South Africa has committed SDR 19.89 million (R272. 00 million), a 0.09% share of
the total IDA donor contributions.
On Trust Funds, South Africa contributes to approximately 10 Trust Funds most of which are
multi-donor trust funds. These include the GEF (Global Environment Facility), International
Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFI), The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis, And
Malaria, and The Cities Alliance Multi Donor Trust Fund. In addition, South Africa has at least
three dedicated Financial Intermediary Fund (FIFs).

OFFICE INITIATIVES AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
5.1    2015 Shareholding Review

Following the second phase of Voice Reform, Governors agreed to conduct periodic IBRD and
IFC Shareholding Reviews, every five years, beginning in 2015. Periodic Shareholding Reviews
were seen as a way to maintain dynamism and reflect global economic changes in IBRD and IFC
shareholding. The precise scope and design of future reviews was not defined, although a review
was distinguished from a shareholding realignment which Governors noted in April 2010 DC
Communique “would not necessarily be required with each review.. “ The principal mechanism
for realignment of shareholding in IBRD and IFC is a Selective Capital Increase, which may or
may not be accompanied by a General Capital Increase.

The EDs generally underscored the need to achieve the Istanbul Principles of moving towards
equitable voting power between Developed Countries and DTCs and the roadmap towards this
objective and on options on possible shareholding realignment, with no dilution of DTCs.

Based on the expectation to provide an update to Governors at the 2015 Spring Meetings, the
Directors discussed the 2015 shareholders’ review and noted that the approach to re-alignment
taken in 2010 was not strictly formula-based. In that approach, a desired outcome was agreed
apriori to have a shift of at least 3% to Developing and Transition Countries (DTCs) using a
“Building Block” approach combined with voluntary forbearance by some members, until a
package that met the overall objective for the realignment and commanded broad support was
achieved.

Based on the discussion, there appeared to be no appetite or willingness to reach a similar
agreement ex ante or an indication of readiness for any voluntary forbearance this time around.
Many Directors cited the non-completion of the 2010 subscription as an excuse. But the Corporate
Secretariat clarified that based on the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, this was no impediment.

Other Directors cited the potential demand for WBG financing in the context of achieving the twin
goals as a more compelling reason to carry out further analysis of the capital adequacy of the Bank
with a view to re-capitalizing it. After exhaustive discussions, Directors could not agree on the
need for re-alignment of shares during this review. Governors will be appropriately notified of this
position at the 2015 spring meetings.


5.2    Status of the IBRD 2010 Subscriptions in EDS 25

All the three countries in the constituency met the deadline of March 16, 2015, for either requesting
for extension for subscription or actual subscription to the IBRD Special Capital Increase (SCI) or
General Capital Increase (GCI). The next vital deadline for Angola is March 16, 2016 to complete
the process of full subscription for the IBRD SCI and payment for the GCI and June 27, 2015 for
Nigeria in terms of full payments for the IFC shares subscribed.

5.3    The Voice Secondment Program Update

The Voice Secondment Program (VSP) started as a five-year pilot program approved by the
Executive Directors (EDs) of the World Bank in April 2004. It aims to improve the capacity of
Developing and Transition Countries (DTC) in dealing with the Bank. The VSP has contributed
to this effort by involving clients in Bank operations directly through participant assignments; and
indirectly by increasing the Developing and Transition Countries’ (DTCs) dialogue with the Bank,
namely, Executive Directors and Bank’s operational teams. In this way, the VSP has also
contributed to the Bank’s operational and development effectiveness. The VSP specifically
contributes to south-south cooperation and the knowledge agenda.

An official from the South African Treasury is participating in the 11th Cohort of the program
which commenced in January 2015. A call for nominations for the 12th Cohort has been circulated
to the Capitals. Nominations will close on Friday, May 15, 2015. The 12th Cohort of the Program
will commence in January 2016 and end in July, 2016.

According to a recent independent assessment of the Program, it is adjudged to have achieved its
goals during its second five-year term of 2010 – 2014. The analysis revealed that so far, the VSP
has succeeded in achieving its overall objectives. The Program is reported to have attained highly
satisfactory success rating in its second term of five years in meeting its goals of upgrading
Secondees’ knowledge and skills to interact with the Bank. It also succeeded in encouraging
informed dialogue and information exchange among a majority of focal agencies and EDs’ offices
and Bank operational staff, when alumni are engaged in their countries’ interface with the Bank.
The VSP has met its targeted retention rate of alumni interacting with the Bank. The program has
also demonstrated relative success in enhancing the quality of benefiting constituents’
contributions to policy and other discussions of the WBG Executive Board compared to the period
before the program.


Changes in Senior Management Post at the World Bank Group


The organizational reforms within the WBG is marked by establishment of new units, mapping
of staff to new Global practices and recruitment of new managers and senior directors, and some
tweaking of the structure at a high level, has resulted in continuous introductions of new positions
at the senior management level. Annexes III and Annex IV provide organizational charts of the
Bank’s senior management and that of the Global Practices respectively.

Appointments were also being made in to Country Management Units with announcements of
New Country Directors for a number of countries in the past few weeks. Among the appointments
are those of Guang Z. Chen, Country Director for South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe; and Elisabeth Huybens, Country Director, Cameroon, Angola,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Sao Tome & Principe.

OTHER EVENTS


6.1    The World Bank Group and the United Nations Collaborates on Post 2015 SDGs

Ahead of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis in July and towards the post 2015
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed Conference in New York in September, this
year, the World Bank has stepped up its collaboration with the United Nations (UN) and other
Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). In furtherance of this collaboration the UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-Moon and representatives of MDBs shall be participating in the Development
Committee (DC) meeting of the World Bank during the 2015 Spring Meetings. At the DC meeting,
Governors will be discussing the paper titled “From Billions to Trillions” – a focus on the
sustainable financing of the SDGs. The World Bank President has continued to show strong
interest in the SDGs processes and the implications for poverty reduction and boosting shared
prosperity.

Internal evaluation report by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the WBG praised the
management of the Bank for the very strong response in many areas of the Millennium
Development Government (MDGs) through its strategies and focused approach towards poverty
reduction. As noted in the IEG’s report, the WBG’s country-based model was crucial for
translating the MDGs into country programs; and for building strategic partnerships at different
levels to support the MDGs. As preparations for the launch of sustainable development goals
intensifies, the WBG has been playing the lead role of facilitating collaboration among the MDBs
and the IMF for a comprehensive response by these important development agents to the post 2015
agenda.

Executive Directors have participated in a number of meetings with UN Under-Secretary General
for Economic and Social Affairs and other UN Officials in New York and Washington DC,
facilitated by the Office of the Corporate Vice President and the President’s Special Envoy to the
UN. The purpose of the meetings has been to forge better understanding and collaboration between
development policy makers and practitioners. The reports of the intergovernmental Committee of
experts on sustainable development financing; and the open working group on sustainable
development goals have been among the areas of consultations with Executive Directors. The
discussions have also paid attention to the domestic resource mobilization. Part of these
conversations enabled the framing of the Secretary General’s Synthesis Report to the UN General
Assembly. This level of collaboration is expected to continue even beyond the Addis FFD.
Executive Directors are broadly supportive of the process so far and of the WBG’s leadership
initiatives.

6.2       Illicit Financial Flows

Following an exchange with the Bank staff on curbing illicit financial flows and Base Erosion and
Profit Shifting (BEPS), the Sub-Saharan African Executive Directors at the Bank in one of their
meetings agreed to discuss options and make recommendations to the management on how the
institution could lend support to Africa and to actions recommended in the report of AU/ECA the
High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa led by Former President Mbeki of South
Africa. Follow-up discussions among EDs’ offices enabled a common understanding on possible
advocacy role that EDs could play, measures required at county level to curb further outflows,
possible partnerships with the Bank and other institutions on the matter, and awareness on existing
in-country, regional and international programs aimed at enhancing domestic resource
mobilization (DRM), addressing tax evasion and base tax erosion, and illicit outflows.

The exchange helped create awareness and build interest among Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) chairs
on the subject of illicit financial flows, and has led to concerted messaging to the Bank to pay
increased attention to the subject as part of the Financing for Development discussion and as part
of the governance global practice (GP) agenda. Some of the suggestions put forward to the World
Bank are:

      •   Use the Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) and the development of Country Partnership
          Framework (CPF) as opportunity to engage countries and identify tax policy and
          administration related weakness and possible programs.
      •   Support regional programs aimed at improving and harmonizing tax regimes
      •   In partnership with the IMF, strengthen the capacities of countries to supervise financial
          flows
      •   Continue with partnerships and analytic work that improves on methods to estimate tax
          losses and illicit outflows


6.3       Visit of South African CEOs to WBG

On 25 February, 2015 the constituency office met a delegation of visiting South African
Engineers/CEOs delegation for an hour’s interactive session. The delegation visited the World
Bank and the IFC to learn more about the institutions, projects financed by the Bank Group in the
region, and policies, standards and processes for procurement of technical services.

The discussion with at the Constituency office facilitated inter alia the understanding of the role
of the Office both within the Bank group as a vital interlocutor with the capitals. Christopher Mark
Browne, World Bank’s chief procurement officer also participated in the meeting providing insight
on procurement policy reform. The CEOs had an opportunity to relay their experiences and
concerns with regard to bidding for projects in the region, and learnt more about the proposed
reforms.

The exchange was helpful in highlighting, for the Constituency team, policy decisions that
should be scrutinized to enable participation of African enterprises in the Bank supported
development and investment projects in the region.

DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE             JOINT MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE OF THE
BOARDS OF GOVERNORS OF THE BANK AND THE FUND ON THE TRANSFER OF REAL
RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 1818 H Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20433 Telephone: (202)
458-2980 Fax: (202) 522-1618

Washington, DC October 11, 2014


1. The Development Committee met today, October 11, 2014, in Washington, D.C.
2. The global economy remains on a cautious watch and is subject to considerable downside risks. Shared
prosperity will require inclusive economic growth, job creation, and a sustained multilateral effort to
empower the poorest and most vulnerable. We encourage the World Bank Group (WBG) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to work together with member countries to implement bold policies to
boost growth and to build resilience.
3. We are pleased that this year’s Global Monitoring Report (GMR) tracks, for the first time, the progress
made in pursuit of the WBG’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a
sustainable manner, while continuing to report on the status of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The GMR’s coverage of inequality between the bottom 40 percent and the rest of the population,
including high-income countries, provided a strong basis for our discussion of shared prosperity.
4. We welcome the discussion on promoting shared prosperity and the WBG’s role in supporting investment
in human capital, improved access to markets, structural reforms, financial inclusion, infrastructure,
improved tax and transfer systems, including social safety nets, and addressing climate change. We
underline the importance of policies and institutions to promote an enabling environment for the
development of the private sector, which is critical for investment, job creation, and inclusive and sustained
economic growth. We call on the WBG to support countries to prioritize and implement tailored policies
in these areas, to track results and impacts, and to build statistical capacity. We welcome the IMF’s
commitment to provide support in its areas of special expertise, including the design of tax policies and
fiscal reforms.
5. Inclusiveness is at the core of shared prosperity. We stress the importance of continuing the WBG’s focus
on gender. We encourage the WBG to deepen gender integration across its operations and to focus more
clearly on implementation and impact. We look forward to the WBG’s updated Gender Equality and
Development Strategy, as well as future updates.

6. IDA countries have recorded strong growth since 2000 and have shown impressive resilience during the
global economic crisis. However, a fifth of IDA countries have not recorded per capita output growth since
then and are vulnerable to adverse shocks, including to natural disasters, epidemics, and economic and
financial sector vulnerabilities that can quickly reverse the progress achieved. We ask that the IMF and the
WBG continue to monitor economic risks and vulnerabilities.
7. We commend the WBG for its leadership and quick response to the Ebola crisis. We welcome the WBG
and IMF’s rapid mobilization of emergency funding to support treatment and containment. We are
encouraged by the joint effort of the international community in West Africa and underscore the importance
of providing additional and ongoing coordinated support on the ground for the World Health Organization’s
Ebola response Road Map. Beyond the human tragedy, economic losses in these countries are devastating.
Swift and coordinated action and financial support are critical to contain and mitigate both direct and long-
term economic impacts of the crisis, and build capacity to effectively deal with epidemics.
8. We call for targeted actions and support for countries in turmoil and transition in the Middle East and
North Africa and in other regions. We emphasize the importance of the WBG and IMF providing adequate
support to these countries. We encourage both institutions to continue to focus on immediate needs and
help set the groundwork for expanded engagement when more stable circumstances allow for it.
9. Fragile and Conflict Situations need a distinctive focus and assistance adapted to their specific challenges.
We call for stronger commitment to achieve concrete, measurable impact, while working to better
understand the drivers of conflict. Small island states remain vulnerable to economic shocks and natural
disaster risks, necessitating support adapted to their unique needs. We encourage the WBG to further
promote and support increased private investment opportunities in these countries.
10. We commend the WBG for integrating climate change and disaster risk management into country
planning, strategies, and financing. We ask the WBG to continue working on climate change, consistent
with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to contribute to the success of the
November Conference of the Parties in Lima, Peru.
11. Investment in infrastructure, including energy, is crucial to sustaining economic growth and ensuring
shared prosperity. We encourage the WBG to continue its operational and advisory support to improve
infrastructure. Funding for the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) is a welcome step to launch a platform
that will facilitate the mobilization of private capital for infrastructure projects. We are hopeful that the GIF
will soon acquire the required scale and ambition. We look forward to increased cooperation to build a
pipeline of commercially, ready-to-finance viable projects. We call on the WBG and IMF to support
countries to deliver efficient, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, including through the Sustainable
Energy for All Initiative.
12. We congratulate the WBG for delivering increased lending, investment, mobilization of resources,
including private sector investment, and advice this past fiscal year, while undergoing a fundamental
internal change process. We expect an important shift in the way the WBG operates to deliver more efficient
support to client countries, drawing on partnerships, integrated regional approaches, and knowledge
sharing, including South-South cooperation, responding to client needs and reacting quickly to unexpected
shocks. We will monitor the implementation of the change process and expect better




                                                       46
lending quality with increased development impact. We welcome the WBG’s reiterated commitment to
diversity and inclusion, which is crucial to its institutional goals. We encourage the WBG to make progress
in achieving the agreed diversity targets as quickly as possible.
13. The UN-led post-2015 Development Agenda provides an opportunity to build a model of development
that is more inclusive and sustainable. We urge the WBG and the IMF to support the international efforts
to reach agreement on the post-2015 development goals. We note the particular significance of the Third
International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015. We expect IDA-17
to be critical for accelerating progress on the MDGs, and the WBG, in general, for successful
implementation of the new development agenda.
14. We remain committed to the completion of the 2010 WBG shareholding realignment and urge all
members who are yet to subscribe to their allocated IBRD and IFC shares to do so. We remain fully
committed to concluding the next shareholding review in 2015.
15. The next meeting of the Development Committee is scheduled to take place on April 18, 2015, in
Washington, DC.

                             90th Meeting of the Development Committee
                                  October 11, 2014 Washington, D.C.

Global Economy

We are concerned about the prevailing uncertainty in the global economy, with growth prospects being
marred by downside risks. These risks are not just reflective of cyclical weaknesses but point to structural
limitations that need to be addressed, in both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging markets and
developing countries (EMDCs). We are particularly concerned that the low growth being experienced may
become the “new normal”. The robust growth experienced in the last two decades in Africa, spurred by
high commodity prices, improved governance and enhanced macroeconomic management, among others,
contributed to a significant increase in the per capita income of many countries on the continent. Sustained
growth and economic progress on the continent is however challenged by a number of factors, including
the direction and divergence of monetary policy in and between high-income countries, exacerbation of
geopolitical tension, a slowdown in growth of large systemically important emerging market economies,
stagnation in the high-income countries and health concerns, specifically the outbreak of Ebola.

At the outset, we would like to acknowledge the important role the World Bank Group (WBG) is playing
in partnership with the World Health Organization, the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and African Development Bank, among others, in containing and eliminating the Ebola virus. We echo the
sentiments of President Kim, where he noted recently that the pandemic brought to the fore the ‘deadly
cost’ of unequal access to basic health services and the consequences of the failure to fix this problem.
Much more needs to be done to contain and eradicate this deadly virus, we therefore call on the international
community to do more, to avoid further human and economic losses, which in turn threatens to erode the
positive gains made to date in the three worst affected countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with
the possibility of wider contagion effects in the rest of the region and beyond. On our part, we will continue
to contribute within our means, noting that Nigeria and South Africa have provided support.

Shared Prosperity

The outlook of the global economy is particularly important for the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity, endorsed a year ago by the Development Committee (DC). When
the DC approved these twin goals, there was optimism with regard to the growth forecast, despite downside
risks. The World Bank has however revised the projected global growth downward, four times from June
2013 to date. Growth is central to achieving the twin goals. As we ponder the future of global growth, the
DC topic of “Promoting Shared Prosperity in an Unequal World”, gives us an opportunity to




                                                     48
reflect on how to make it more inclusive, by ensuring that the bottom 40% also benefit from the gains of
economic growth. Discussion on this topic, we believe, is beneficial to both AEs and EMDCs.
We therefore welcome the timing of this discussion and commend the Bank for its analysis of the key
challenges on the issue of shared prosperity, the on-going work and positioning of the WBG to assist client
countries, as well as President Kim’s leadership role in this regard. We concur with the Bank’s main
findings on the significance of jobs and the private sector, investing in people and social safety nets and
inclusive growth in addressing challenges to promoting shared prosperity. We therefore agree with the Bank
that countries face a three-fold agenda of enhancing human capabilities and building assets of the bottom
40%; improving access to markets; and strengthening tax and tax transfer systems. The journey in terms of
how countries get to the point of identifying the most appropriate responses is particularly important, since
it will vary from one country to another and region to region.

Understanding the dynamics of our particular countries, including the adequacy of data and prioritization
of policy choices, as well as the linkages between polices, among others, is critical for the structural
transformation of our economies. To this end, we note the reorganization of the Bank’s structure, with a
focus on becoming a knowledge repository particularly in reflection to what policy choices and
interventions work; the new Country Engagement Model (CEM), focusing on providing in depth analyses
of the key challenges and opportunities in focusing on the bottom 40% of our respective countries, with the
Bank targeting its assistance to where it has a comparative advantage; and enhancing the Bank’s lending
capacity.

We also welcome the 2014 Global Monitoring Report (GMR), which we find extremely informative in
outlining the progress and challenges to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The report
is particularly significant because it incorporates the WBG’s twin goals in its assessment, as well as
monitoring shared prosperity in developed countries, making this year’s GMR a truly global report. In
addition to noting that the MDGs will not be achieved by 2015, the report is also not optimistic about the
future prospects of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Achieving the WBG’s corporate goals will
therefore require a significant shift in growth patterns, including engaging closely with client countries on
what needs to be done, the Bank will also need to increase its engagement and partnership with global and
regional entities to deliver what is considered a global public good.

Macroeconomic Developments in Low-Income Developing Countries

We note the IMF’s recent release of a report on the macroeconomic developments in low-income
developing countries (LIDCs). We look forward to further engagement with the WBG and the IMF not only
in assisting LIDCs in developing appropriate comprehensive responses to these challenges but also putting
in place metrics that assist us in tracking progress.

Gender Progress Report

We note the progress made in the integration of gender equality in the operations of the WBG and we look
forward to the revised gender and development strategy.

Diversity of the World Bank Group

The on-going change process not only provides an opportunity for the WBG to make important internal
changes regarding the way it does business; it is also an opportunity to entrench diversity and inclusion as
a culture of the WBG through matching words with actions. We want to see an organization that is diverse,
one that includes gender, regional representation and a range of educational institutions from around the
world, at all levels of the WBG. This adds richness to what the Bank has to offer.

updates on progress on a regular basis.
