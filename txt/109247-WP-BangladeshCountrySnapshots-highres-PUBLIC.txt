     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     Dhaka ranks high among the world’s major cities in terms of poor urban air quality. Substantially reducing air pollution could save up to 3,500 lives and avoid up
     to 230 million cases of respiratory diseases annually in Bangladesh. In economic terms, this is equivalent to around $500 million in health care costs and reduced
     productivity per annum .

     The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment project (CASE) is the first program of its kind to tackle pollution from two of the country’s biggest polluters, brickfields
     and urban transport, as well as ensure safe mobility for people in the capital. The project directly tackles pollution by encouraging the adoption of cleaner brick
     manufacturing technologies that require less energy. The project also encourages research into technology alternatives to bricks such as non-fired bricks. In addition
     the project provides technical support (i) to strengthen environmental laws that introduce stricter standards and stronger “polluter pays” principles for industrial
     pollution (ii) to the newly established Air Quality Wing (AQW) at the Department of Environment (DoE), that is responsible for air quality monitoring, data analysis and
     reporting and public information and overall management.

     In urban transport, the project is demonstrating safe pedestrian mobility in Dhaka by (i) rehabilitating and improving sidewalks (ii) constructing foot over bridges and
     (iii) traffic management measures by improving intersections, installing traffic signals and training the traffic police.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) Project aims to improve air quality and safe mobility in Dhaka through the implementation of demonstration
     initiatives in urban transport and brick-making. CASE components include:
     ■■     Encouraging the adoption of cleaner and more energy-efficient brick manufacturing technologies such as converting to improved kiln alternatives and launching
            12 demonstration projects. The project also encourages research into alternatives to bricks such as micro-concrete, while helping the government strengthen
            environmental laws and providing support for the newly established Air Quality Management section responsible for air quality monitoring, data analysis, and
            reporting.
     ■■     Promoting safe pedestrian mobility in Dhaka by rehabilitating and improving sidewalks with drainage, constructing foot bridges; improving traffic management
            by upgrading intersections, installing traffic signals and training police in enforcing them; supporting studies for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Line 3.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Installation of 11 Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAMS) in eight cities to monitor major air pollutants and generate real-time air quality data.
     ■■     Completion of eight clean and energy-efficient brick kiln pilots, with another two underway.
     ■■     Air Quality Index (AQI) regularly published in project website (www.case-moef.gov.bd).
     ■■     Brick Manufacturing and Kiln Construction Control Act approved in 2013 and the relevant rules at the final stage of preparation.
     ■■     Completion of 65 kilometers of sidewalk and road improvement, and 36 intersection improvements.
     ■■     Construction of 21 footbridges, with four others being built.
     ■■     Installation of 62 traffic signals connected with solar panel and battery.
     ■■     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     ■■     Ministry of Environment and Forest, Department of Environment, Dhaka South and North City Corporations, and Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. To address this challenge, Bangladesh launched its Climate Change
Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) in 2009 to build a medium- to long-term program for enhancing resilience to climate shocks and facilitating low carbon and
sustainable growth. To support implementation of the BCCSAP, seven development partners established the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) in
2010, with the World Bank acting as trust fund administrator. The fund will close in June 2017. About $40 million of unprogrammed funds were refunded in 2016
following donor requests.

The objective of the BCCRF is to support implementation of the BCCSAP, a 10 -year program (2009-2018) aimed at building the capacity and resilience of the country
to meet the challenge of climate change. Sectoral ministries are implementing four investment projects:
■■     Cyclone shelters ($25 million);
■■     Solar irrigation ($10 million);
■■     Afforestation ($33.8 million); and
■■     Community climate change ($12.5 million). A number of studies on climate change have also been undertaken.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■     61 new multipurpose cyclone shelters built in climate-vulnerable areas. These are now complete.
■■     45,000 farmers provided with access to clean energy services for irrigation pumping.
■■     17,000 hectares of land reforested or afforested.
■■     40,000 climate vulnerable people receive resilient investments/advice to build climate adaptive capacity.

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     Bangladesh’s coastal zone spans over 580 kilometers and includes territory where 28 percent of the population resides. A higher percentage of the population lives
     below the absolute poverty line in the coastal area than in the rest of the country. A recent World Bank study on the cost of adapting to extreme weather estimated
     that eight million people are currently vulnerable to inundation depths greater than three meters due to cyclonic storm surges. This number will increase to 13.5
     million people by 2050. There is an urgent need to rehabilitate and upgrade protection polders – areas of low-lying land - and enhance the resilience of coastal areas
     to cyclones, tidal and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion.

     Coastal embankments are an integral part of the disaster risk reduction program for Bangladesh. There is clear evidence that embankments provided an effective
     buffer during the tidal surge resulting from Cyclone Sidr in 2007, damages and losses were much lower and lives were saved in areas where effective embankments
     were present.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     CEIP1 aims to: (i) increase the area protected in selected polders from tidal flooding and storm surges, which are expected to worsen due to climate change; (ii)
     improve agricultural production by reducing saline water intrusion in selected polders; and (iii) improve the government’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively
     to a crisis or emergency. The Project has the following five components:
     ■■     Rehabilitation and Improvement of Polders.
     ■■     Implementation of Social and Environmental Management Frameworks and Plans.
     ■■     Construction Supervision, Project Monitoring and Evaluation, and Coastal Zone Monitoring.
     ■■     Project Management, Technical Assistance, Training and Strategic Studies.
     ■■     Contingent Emergency Response.
     The project will rehabilitate 17 polders in six coastal districts. The rehabilitated polders will provide direct protection to the 760,000 people living within the polder
     boundaries and enhance the resilience of the coastal areas to cyclones, tidal and flood inundations, and salinity intrusion. This in turn will enhance people’s livelihoods
     through increased agricultural production during normal weather and reduced loss of life, assets, crops and livestock in the event of a disaster.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS :
     ■■     Rehabilitation of 17 polders in six coastal districts: Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Pirojpur
     ■■     108,800 hectares to be protected
     ■■     Improved protection for 760,000 people living within polder boundaries.
     ■■     623 km of embankment to be rehabilitated
     ■■     794 km of drainage channel to be upgraded
     ■■     129 drainage structures to be replaced or upgraded
     ■■     Poverty reduction and stimulated economic development from facilitating the growth of farm and non-farm activities in the coastal area.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES :
Chittagong, Bangladesh’s second-largest city, suffers from inadequate water production and sewerage systems. The port city’s water production capacity is only 40
percent of the estimated demand, and the pipe network is run down. A large percentage of the city continues to access water through shallow tube wells. The quality of
this underground water is questionable, with high salt and iron levels posing health risks to the public. In addition, very little investment has been made into sanitation
and storm water drainage since the late 1980s. Chittagong still does not have a water-borne sewage system or effective storm-water drainage service. The Chittagong
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) lacks both the capacity and finance to establish these systems. The Bank helped CWASA develop its institutional
capacity development program launched in June 2012.

The Chittagong Water Supply Improvement and Sanitation Project was restructured in February 2014 following the mid-term review held in December 2013. This
included a small cancellation and a reduction in the scope of investment activities. In June 2015, the project was restructured a second time to extend the closing date
of the project to December 31, 2018.

The project aims to increase access to safe water and improve CWASA’s institutional capacity and investment planning for sanitation and drainage in Chittagong. It
supports major interventions in treated water production, transmission and distribution including the construction of a water treatment plant in CWASA’s development
plan and the rehabilitation and extension of the water distribution system. The support includes studies to update the sewerage master plans and drainage master
plans for Chittagong, as well as capacity building at operational levels to improve the efficiency of overall service delivery. Project performance is primarily driven by
major works packages that account for about 80 percent of the restructured project.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Construction of Modunaghat Water Treatment Plant and installation of distribution and transmission mains are ongoing according to work plan.
■■     Construction on Kalurghat Booster Station has been completed.
■■     Contracts for all key technical assistance activities, including for the sanitation and drainage master planning and for utility modernization, have been signed and
       are advancing well.
■■     100 percent of all project funds are now committed.
■■     Water now available in five low-income communities.
■■     150,000 people will be provided with access to improved water sources by project closing.
■■     CWASA has ensured 85 percent O&M cost coverage cost from direct water sales revenue.
■■     Project to prepare $150 million of priority sanitation and drainage investments for financing.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     On November 15, 2007, Cyclone Sidr made landfall across the southern coast of Bangladesh, causing extensive damage to lives and property. Overall, around 30
     districts and nine million people were affected by the storm. Total damage and losses were estimated at about $1.7 billion.

     The project will support government efforts to facilitate recovery from the damage to livelihoods and infrastructure caused by Cyclones Sidr in 2007 and Aila in
     2009, and strengthen disaster risk reduction and management. The project has six components: (i) restoration of the agriculture sector in Sidr/Aila-affected areas;
     (ii) improvement of existing multipurpose shelters and construction of new shelters; (iii) rehabilitation of coastal embankments; (iv) strengthening the capacity
     of the government’s disaster risk reduction management; (v) monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective implementation of the sub-projects; and (vi) a project
     management component to support the government in coordinating all project-related activities, strategic studies for the preparation of future operations for the
     long-term disaster risk reduction program, and technical assistance and training, as well as providing emergency support for future disasters during implementation.

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Activities to restore the agriculture sector (under the first component of the project) were completed successfully in 2014. The activities exceeded targets, with
          crops by 33 percent, livestock by 13 percent and fisheries by 30 percent. 38,000 households have been provided with livestock and 37,000 with aquaculture
          inputs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Bangladesh government allocates about 2.2 percent of GDP to education, but just 0.2 percent is dedicated to tertiary education. With 85 percent of the tertiary
education budget feeding into recurring expenditures, development programs for promoting and establishing research and innovation in higher education institutes
(HEIs) remain under-funded. There is still no effective mechanism linking university research with industry and business at home or abroad. Low connectivity and
inadequate information and communication technology further limit knowledge exchanges and collaboration among HEIs and their researchers with local and global
research platforms.

The Project’s objective is to improve the quality and relevance of the teaching and research environment in higher education institutions by encouraging innovation
and accountability and by enhancing the technical and institutional capacity.

It will do so by promoting academic innovation among eligible public and private universities through a competitive funding mechanism known as the Academic
Innovation Fund (AIF). The AIF is granted through four windows: (i) improvement of teaching and learning; (ii) enhancement of research capabilities at the universities;
(iii) university-wide innovations including establishment of Technology Transfer Office; and (iv) innovation and university-industry collaboration. The project also
supports the establishment of quality assurance mechanisms at national and institutional levels for the tertiary education sector. In addition, the project has established
the Bangladesh Research and Education Network (BdREN), which connects universities to high-speed data communications network, enabling teachers, researchers,
and students to access the latest knowledge, inter-university video classes and engage in collaborative research. The University Grant Commission Digital Library has
also been established and is operational with public and private universities.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   345 academic innovation grants awarded to 27 public and 9 private universities through 3 rounds. 10 university-industry collaboration grants to spur innovation
     have been awarded under Window 4. The AIF grants have supported research and innovations including enhanced methods for breast cancer detection, vaccina-
     tion for farm animal disease, etc. as well as dissemination of new knowledge through production of 194 peer-reviewed academic journals.
■■   BdREN connectivity is fully functional at the University Grants Commission (UGC) and in 35 public and private universities.
■■   UGC Digital Library is fully operational, providing 42 member universities (33 public, 9 private) and 2 research institutions access to over 30,000 e-resources
     (research databases, e-journals, e-books).
■■   Quality assurance mechanism has been introduced through establishment of Institutional Quality Assurance Cells (IQACs) in 61 public and private universities,
     which are conducting around 800 self-assessments.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in improving the health of the population, especially women and children. The country is on track to achieve child and
     maternal mortality Millennium Development Goals. Significant achievements have been made in the control of communicable diseases. The country conducted the
     world’s largest measles-rubella campaign earlier in 2014, covering 53 million children. The World Health Organization recently declared Bangladesh a polio-free
     zone. Still, considerable development challenges remain. Non-communicable diseases represent a growing share of the total burden of disease. In addition to
     increasing cardiovascular disease and injuries, figures for malnourished women and children, although in decline, are still very high. There is growing concern about
     the rise in overweight individuals. Public spending on health is low in comparison to other countries, with out of pocket expenditures at 63.35 percent of total health
     spending. Catastrophic health expenditures push people into poverty. The population is rapidly urbanizing -- creating new challenges for the delivery of social and
     health services, particularly to the poor. The health workforce is insufficient and inefficiently distributed, the provision of health services is fragmented, and the quality
     of health care needs improvement.

     The Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) aims to enable the Government of Bangladesh to strengthen health systems and improve services, particularly for
     the poor. It supports the government in providing essential health services, including reproductive health, family planning and antenatal care; scaling up emergency
     obstetric and newborn care services; and ensuring 24-hour services in district hospitals and selected health centers. The project also aligns multiple development
     partners to the country’s priorities in health, nutrition, and population, and uses country systems for implementation and monitoring. It strengthens health-sector
     planning and resource management, human resource development, pharmaceuticals management, health information systems and the maintenance of health care
     facilities. In addition, HSDP seeks to improve the control and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases through the provision of vaccinations,
     scaling up HIV/AIDS interventions for the most-at-risk groups, and improving the quality of treatment for tuberculosis and the control and treatment of malaria in 13
     highly endemic areas. For non-communicable diseases, HSDP aims to improve awareness of cardio-vascular disease risks, provide better diagnosis and management
     of diabetes, and improve screening for cancer.

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Agriculture provides livelihoods more than 60 percent of the population of Bangladesh. Despite Bangladesh’s success in reaching near self-sufficiency in food
production, people living in the flash flood and drought-prone districts in the northwest and the saline-affected tidal surge areas in the south struggle to earn a living
or produce enough food to eat. These regions suffer from higher poverty than the national average. The link between unfavorable agricultural environments, where
farmers lack knowledge and technology, and chronic poverty, coupled with food insecurity, is abundantly clear in these areas.

The project aims to enhance the productivity of agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries) in selected agro-ecologically constrained and economically depressed areas.

It seeks to use technology and training to enhance agricultural production in the northern and southern districts affected by flash floods, drought and tidal surge areas
affected by saline. The project focuses on alleviating poverty and increasing food security through increased production of major crops such as cereals, diversification
of high-value non-cereal crops such as fruits and vegetables, and development of non-crop agriculture such as fishery, poultry, and livestock. Livelihood Field Schools
improve farmers’ understanding and skills base, and also demonstrate the use of improved technologies. The project also aims to release new and improved crop
varieties and more productive fish species, and help farmers increase crop intensity by conserving and utilizing surface water and improving the availability and
efficient use of irrigation water.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   The Department of Agriculture Extension formed about 10,500 Livelihood Field Schools and conducted more than 43,000 demonstrations on various crops and
     improved technologies.
■■   The Department of Fisheries formed 2,100 fish farmer groups and conducted 5,880 demonstrations on improved fish varieties and production technologies.
■■   Improved agricultural technologies adopted by more than 300,000 farmers, including improved irrigation for 27,750 ha.
■■   Release for use of 18 improved production packages for crops and 9 for aquaculture, as well as 15 improved various crop varieties (four improved varieties of
     Wheat, one hybrid of mustard, one pulses and five new rice varieties);
■■   BADC processed 3,500 tons of certified seeds in new facilities.
■■   About 300,000 farmers received training in different technologies under crops, livestock and fisheries.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bangladesh’s aspiration to become a middle-income country has been constrained by the large gap in infrastructure investment. Bridging the infrastructure gap has
     two major challenges: (i) low country capacity to conceptualize, design, and contract infrastructure ventures; and (ii) lack of long-term financing for successful closure
     of the infrastructure investment proposals. Key infrastructure ministries/agencies of the government have a long way to go before they can gather adequate technical
     and financial capacity to develop and implement the required infrastructure projects. Fiscal constraints on the government add on to financing side of the problem.
     As such, Government of Bangladesh has adopted the policy of promoting private sector participation in key infrastructure sectors, including energy and power, roads
     and bridges, information and communications technology, inland container terminal, river port and sea-port infrastructure. Public-private partnership (PPP) has been
     identified as an important tool to leverage the technical, financial, and project management resources of the private sector. The country’s commercial-bank-dominated
     financial sector has historically been lending for shorter terms spanning over one – three years, extending these days to a maximum of five/six years. Limited financial
     capacity, risk of asset liability mismatch, and lack of integration to international debt markets have constrained the local financial institutions’ ability to finance
     infrastructure projects for longer terms such as 10 to 15 years. As a consequence, infrastructure development programs, which are long-term in nature, had been
     suffering and the country needed Internal Development Association support with new lending facility to bridge the infrastructure gap.

     This project was taken up to increase private-sector investment in infrastructure by working with key government agencies and local financial institutions (FIs), selected
     based on pre-set eligibility criteria. Under the facility, the FIs apply to Bangladesh Bank, the project’s implementing agency, for partial debt financing, which they on-
     lend to private-sector sponsors awarded or licensed to implement infrastructure sub-project.
     The objectives of the project are: (i) to supplement the resources of local financial institutions to provide long-term finance for infrastructure investment proposals;
     and (ii) to promote the role of entrepreneurs in infrastructure development. To this end, apart from the main on-lending component, the project provides for technical
     assistance in two streams: for institutional strengthening of the PPP Office of Government, and for development of pipeline sub-projects by supporting upstream
     activities including feasibility studies, transaction support, and preparation of bid documents. The overarching goal is to increase eligibility of the sub-projects for IPFF
     funding and impart good practices in project development in Bangladesh.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Delivery of 12 fully operational power plants, adding over 550 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the national grid.
     ■■     Financing of three central water treatment plants in export processing zones of Chittagong, Adamjee and, Commilla.
     ■■     Support to a nationwide fiber optic cable network sub-project, which will expand Internet outreach and speed, and an inland container terminal in Chittagong.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
A reliable and authentic National Identification (ID) system serves as an efficient, secure data platform for delivering multiple public services. The Election Commission
Bangladesh (ECB) has established a National Identity (NID) database, based on their internationally-accredited electoral roll database, and issued paper-laminated
NID cards to about 90 million registrants.

The Project Development Objective is to establish a secure, accurate, and reliable national identification system in Bangladesh to serve as the basis for more efficient
and transparent service delivery. The IDEA Project has established a secure, accurate, and reliable national identification (NID) management system in Bangladesh
to serve as the basis for more efficient, inclusive, and transparent service delivery. The NID system is providing identity authentication services (online, offline and
biometric) to number of citizens’ service delivery agencies. Any agency delivering services to citizens in Bangladesh can now greatly reduce their transaction costs by
efficiently identifying their clients and maintaining their own databases of users/customers.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   The NID database contains around 100 million (49.58% female and 50.32% male) registrants.
■■   Now 62 agencies are using ID authentication service of the NIDW. There are 10 public agencies and 52 private sector agencies.
■■   All 6 mobile phone operators of Bangladesh have started using online biometric identity authentication service for their users’ SIM registration and replacement.
■■   The Finance Division of the Government has emerged as an important and busy user of the system like the National Board of Revenue (e-TIN). They required all
     civil servants and pensioners to use the NID number and identity authentication with the NID system.
■■   The mapping of the 17-digit NID number containing year of birth and geographical information of citizens into 10-digit Unique Identification Numbers has been
     completed.
■■   Some 90 mission paper-laminated cards will soon be replaced by smart NID cards which have robust security features. The center for the personalization of smart
     NID cards has been set up and the mass production of the smart cards has started.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
     Although Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction and human development outcomes, extreme poverty and vulnerability remain stubborn
     problems. The country ranks sixth in the world on prevalence of stunting. The incidence of low birth weight is also among the highest at 22 percent, with maternal
     under-nutrition at about 24 percent. The poor, in particular, experience under-nutrition. Improving nutrition and cognitive development opportunities for poor
     children is critical to arrest intergenerational transmission of poverty and presents an early window of opportunity to address inequality and improve outcomes later
     in life. Failure to invest adequately in the wellbeing of children from an early age has long-term implications for children and society as a whole, because it increases
     the likelihood of poverty in adulthood and perpetuates intergenerational transmission of poverty.

     The Income Support Program for the Poorest Project (Jawtno) is a cash transfer program that provides income support to poor mothers in selected locations while: (i)
     increasing the mothers’ use of Child Nutrition and Cognitive Development services and (ii) enhancing local-level capacity to deliver safety nets. Quarterly cash transfers
     will be made to eligible households based on their fulfillment of co-responsibilities linked to the growth and development of their young children (up to age 5). These
     include: (i) utilization of antenatal care services up to four times during pregnancy; (ii) use of growth monitoring and promotion services; and (iii) attendance at child
     nutrition and cognitive development awareness sessions. The average size of the monthly benefit is between $15-23, depending on the beneficiary profile, and falls
     within 20 percent of the estimated monthly per capita expenditure of the target population. In keeping with the government’s family planning policy, only the first
     and second born children will be eligible, to help prevent distorted incentives.
     The project also provides technical assistance to the implementing agency to facilitate administration and implementation of the cash transfer program, which
     includes building partnerships with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the use of community clinics to deliver services and with the Ministry of Post and
     Telecommunications for the use of biometric Post Office cash cards for beneficiary payments. A robust monitoring and evaluation framework has also been designed
     to assess progress in achieving the project’s objectives through third party monitoring and evaluate the impact of cash transfers on household poverty and children’s
     health outcomes.

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Project locations have been identified based on poverty and malnutrition criteria. The project will be implemented in 43 upazilas (sub-districts) across northern
          Bangladesh reaching up to 600,000 mothers and their families.
     ■■   Partnership arrangements have been finalized with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for service delivery at local Community Clinics; Ministry of Post and
          Telecommunications for electronic cash transfers through Post Office cash cards, and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for use of household poverty data.
     ■■   Central and field level staffing is completed.
     ■■   Comprehensive child nutrition and cognitive development curriculum drafted and to be consulted on with wide range of stakeholders ahead of finalization.
     ■■   Cash transfers and services tentatively expected to commence in December 2016.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     Local Government Division, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development & Cooperatives.

     KEY PARTNERS:
     Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Post and Telecommunication and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics are key partners of the Local Government Division
     and will be providing a variety of services for the project.

     The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation has recently approved $1.1 million towards the cost of the impact evaluation of the project. Innovations for Poverty Action
     has also expressed interest in partnering on the project evaluation and discussions are ongoing. Several trust funds have also been secured to provide technical
     assistance to the project, including the Early Learning Partnership and Rapid Social Response funds

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bangladesh’s information and communications technology (ICT) industry has developed significantly over the past decade. The government recognizes the need to
leverage electronic government (e-government) for public service delivery and to facilitate its reform efforts. However, the lack of shared IT hosting infrastructure,
governance policies, and standards and structures present a major barrier to providing seamless electronic services and improving the public sector’s effectiveness
and efficiency. The information technology (IT) industry sub-sector has also remained relatively nascent as compared to the telecommunications sub-sector, with total
industry output estimated at $300 million per annum at the project’s initiative.

The project will establish e-government foundations and institutional capacity for the government to leverage ICT for public sector modernization, and lay groundwork
for an eventual whole-of-government approach for governance reforms and public service transformation to citizens and businesses. This project will also support the
development of Bangladesh’s IT/IT Enabled Services (ITES) industry as the country possesses a comparative advantage in the sub-sector.

The project aims to establish basic e-government foundations to support public-sector modernization; and catalyze growth of Bangladesh’s IT and enabled services
industry for employment creation and export diversification. The project’s e-government component will provide critical ICT foundations to support public-sector
modernization, initiate transformation of the e-government agenda for the years ahead. This includes expansion of the national datacenter, training on e-government
for relevant public officials, and establishing enterprise architecture, interoperability framework, cybersecurity standards and guidelines, and setting up the country’s
computer incident response team. The IT/ITES component will increase the competitiveness of Bangladesh’s sub-sector by increasing the quantity and quality of skills,
provide strategic direction for industry development, and increase IT/ITES awareness and investments in the country. This includes relevant training for workers and
middle management, institutional capacity building, and industry development strategy, promotion, and international business development.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS
■■   Improve Bangladesh’s ranking on the World Economic Forum’s Network Readiness Index by at least five places: Improved global ranking of 109 in 2015; from

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Despite strong economic growth and a steady decline in poverty in Bangladesh over the past decade, natural disasters regularly cause serious damage to the country’s
     infrastructure and agricultural, severely affecting food access and food availability for the poor and vulnerable. The expected increase in the frequency and intensity
     of weather-related shocks makes it imperative that the government enhance its preparedness to address food insecurity in disaster-prone areas. The Public Food
     Distribution System (PFDS) is a core element of the government’s food security strategy. The modern food storage facilities proposed for construction under this
     project could considerably improve the efficacy of the government’s emergency response and recovery efforts in disaster-prone areas, and if grain stocks are properly
     managed, could enhance the efficiency of its PFDS at the same time.
     The Modern Food Storage Facilities Project’s overall objective is to increase the grain reserve available to households to meet post-disaster needs and improve the
     efficiency of grain storage management.

     Components include improving the storage capacity for grain by financing the construction of modern steel silos for rice and wheat that will be built in accordance
     with social and environmental sustainability parameters and safeguards compliance criteria. The project will facilitate households’ access to domestic silos for food
     grain and seed storage to improve food security during and after natural disasters. It will finance investments in small-scale storage at the rural household level, which
     is expected to bring important benefits to the farming community in the form of safer storage of rice seed (which is more valuable than commercial grain). Another
     component will finance costs required to ensure adequate overall management of the project, monitoring and evaluation of the activities implemented, and capacity
     enhancement of selected stakeholders. The project has been restructured to adjust project funding resulting from the decision not to proceed with the signing of the
     Bangladesh Climate Change and Resilience Fund Agreement due to its early closing date. Additional financing from the IDA will be considered in due time if and
     when funds are needed.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Increased availability of grain stocks (400,000 metric tons at the end of the project)
     ■■   Increased number of households whose grain needs can be met (4.5 million)
     ■■   Decreased grain storage cost (from $800 to $300 per ton)
     ■■   Reduced loss in grain stocks (from 17percent to three percent losses)
     ■■   Food grade household silos will be distributed to 500,000 families in disaster prone areas

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bangladesh is subject to a tropical monsoon-type climate, prone to cyclones, flooding, and drought. Bangladesh is also at risk for earthquakes and tsunamis, sitting
at or near the juncture of several active tectonic boundaries. Cyclones typically affect Bangladesh in the fall and spring, the intervals between the dry season and the
monsoon season.. Cyclones move northward across the Indian Ocean and almost every year at least one makes landfall in Bangladesh.

The coast is approximately 710 km long and is home to nearly 40 million people. Cyclones affect the region with strong winds accompanied by powerful storm surges
and widespread inundation over a vast area. After the severe cyclone of 1970, which killed an estimated 300,000 people, the Government of Bangladesh pledged
to improve protection of the coastal population. In the subsequent decades, the government constructed a network of cyclone shelters in the coastal areas, and
developed an early warning system for local communities called the Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP). Between 1970 and 2007, around 1,700 cyclone shelters
were constructed, with the aim of providing protection from high winds and storm surges common during cyclones. The growing network of cyclone shelters and the
community-based early warning system has served to save lives and assets.
The Multipurpose Disaster Shelters Project (MDSP) is a large-scale, disaster risk mitigation infrastructure project that strengthens emergency preparedness and will
significantly reduce vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. This builds on initial phases of interventions in multipurpose disaster shelters advanced
under Emergency 2007 Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project (ECRRP), considered the first phase of investments. The project is expected to have an impact on long-
term disaster resiliency in Bangladesh, focused particularly on the coastal region. MDSP would focus on meeting these high priority needs by providing construction
of 552 new shelters and the improvement of 450 existing shelters. The project will also invest in connecting roads and communication networks to shelters, increasing
accessibility and effectiveness. It is expected that by safeguarding lives and assets, the project will contribute to goals of continued growth and shared prosperity.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
The project is expected to benefit nearly 14 million people living in the nine coastal districts of Bangladesh by improving access to safe havens in the event of a natural
disaster. This would serve to build the resilience of local communities to such natural calamities, and help to speed recovery by protecting critical assets. In addition,
the project aims to construct multipurpose buildings, especially primary schools.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanizing countries in the world. The population density and high urban growth are putting great
     pressure on basic urban services, particularly on local governments, district towns or municipalities and city corporations that are entrusted to provide such services.
     Bangladesh has 331 urban local bodies (ULBs), comprising 10 city corporations and 321 municipalities. Despite progress in the decentralization reform agenda, the
     capacity of these urban institutions is still weak: they have limited fiscal autonomy and decision-making powers, inadequate own-source revenues, and weak systems
     of accountability. Infrastructure in these ULBs is very inadequate, and whatever assets they have are poorly maintained, if at all.

     The MGSP is designed to address weak governance and help infrastructure development and maintenance in participating ULBs. It is designed to provide incentives
     to ULBs that demonstrate significant improvements in planning, financial management, and accountability. The project is reaching out to ULBs through the Local
     Government Engineering Department (LGED) (for 26 selected ULBs in the Dhaka-Chittagong growth corridor) and through the Bangladesh Municipal Development
     Fund (BMDF) (under a grant-loan-equity subproject financing scheme) for ULBs that meet creditworthiness criteria. The project is also pursuing intensive capacity-
     building activities to enable ULBs to perform better and carry out their functions effectively. It also features a contingent emergency response component to enable
     ULBs to carry out disaster response activities if needed.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The project development objective is to improve municipal governance and basic urban services in participating ULBs, and to improve the government’s capacity to
     respond effectively to emergencies. Into its second year of effectiveness, the project has initiated implementation of a number of small-scale infrastructure investments
     in the participating ULBs. These are mostly micro drains, road resurfacing, and construction of kitchen markets. In the 26 LGED ULBs, the operation and maintenance
     (O&M) activities were supported on a pilot basis, to allow these ULBs to prioritize O&M activities through planning and integrating O&M costs into their annual budget
     programs. Procurement of consultants to carry out activities that relate to the performance enhancement components (for example, performance assessment, capacity-
     building consultants) as well as to prepare the BMDF road map for improving its operations is under way. Preparations for the conduct of third party monitoring have
     been initiated while the Country Investment Plan process has been carried out to improve the quality of subprojects to be supported by the MGSP. Improvements in
     the execution of the O&M component are also being discussed with the ULBs. Bottlenecks in the procurement of key project inputs will need to be addressed to ensure
     that the project can achieve its objectives and keep implementation on track

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
National Agricultural Technology Program Phase II Project (NATP-2) builds on the successes of its predecessor NATP. It will support the government’s strategic priorities
in agriculture, i.e., increasing production, achieving food security, supporting adaptation to climate change, and enhancing nutrition through safer and more
diversified food. The overarching principle of NATP-2 is to promote a more demand-driven approach to improvement of agricultural technology and modernization of
on-farm practices that takes into account the growing demand from consumers for safer food, as well as the needs of farmers for more diversified production. NATP-II
will contribute directly to the Ministry of Agriculture’s (MoA) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock’s (MoFL) priority of increasing farm yields and diversifying
agricultural production by improving agricultural research and extension.

Its dual field-level strategy will deepen the interventions initiated by the previous project in existing sub districts and expand the geographic coverage to include new
sub districts. NATP-II will cover 57 of the country’s 64 districts and span a broad range of agro-ecological zones across Bangladesh. The project will be implemented
over a six-year period in up to 270 of the country’s 493 sub-districts (or upazilas); this includes 107 upazilas already covered under NATP, plus up to 163 new upazilas.
The primary project beneficiaries will be smallholder farmers (i.e., small, marginal and landless farmers). The project will promote gender mainstreaming and women’s
empowerment to ensure that a significant proportion of direct beneficiaries are female. Other direct project beneficiaries include extension workers, agricultural
researchers, and to a lesser extent, rural entrepreneurs.

The project development objective for NATP-2 is to increase agricultural productivity of small holders’ farms and improve small-holder farmers’ access to markets in
selected districts.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
The project is expected to be effective in September, 2016

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The garment industry in Bangladesh accounts for 75 to 80 percent of Bangladesh’s export earnings, and has also played a significant role in providing economic
     benefits to poor and vulnerable women. Today, around 80 percent of the garment workers are female. Yet, the number of poor women from impoverished north-
     western districts joining the garments sector is much lower than the number of women garment workers from other parts of the country. Female garment workers
     constitute a highly vulnerable group, with few support systems in place that provide them adequate training or social services. For these women, their first few months
     in the city and at the factory are the most hazardous, deterring many women who are in desperate need of work from joining the industry.

     The Northern Areas Reduction of Poverty Initiative (NARI) aims to recruit 10,800 women from five districts in northern Bangladesh for an orientation course to help
     them make informed decisions about beginning a new life in one of three export processing zones (EPZs) in Dhaka, Karnaphuli, or Ishwardi. The women will be settled
     into newly built complexes, with transitional housing facilities at dormitories, giving them time to develop social networks and support systems. The project provides
     two and a half months of training in skills for the garment industry, allowing women to enter factories as semi-skilled workers. Trainees also will receive life-skills
     training, covering topics such as adjustment to city life, savings and remittances, safety and security, rights and responsibilities at the work-place, finding appropriate
     housing, contract negotiation, and health and fertility.

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED 2RESULTS
     ■■   Three dormitories and training centers constructed.
     ■■   First batch of training with 900 girls recruited from the target group, underway.
     ■■   The Information, Education Campaign to raise awareness in source areas, orient and recruit beneficiaries 	          launched and is nearing completion for the sec-
          ond group.
     ■■   Dialogue at mature stage for partnering with the biggest brands and buyers (H&M, Walmart, Primark etc.) that source ready-made garments from Bangladesh to
          leverage corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for the 	      operating costs of the project, and link the beneficiaries of the project with ongoing CSR activi-
          ties at the factory and community level.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Around 10,800 women will gain formal employment, and networks will be established for continuing the flow of potential workers. Two and a half months of training
     will be provided and the project will place the trainees into employment through placement services built into the project. The women will also be accommodated in
     transitional housing facilities for up to five months.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Nuton Jibon Livelihood Improvement Project (NJLIP) is the follow-up project to the Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement “Nuton Jibon” Project, also called
Social Investment Program Project II (SIPP II), which was closed in December 31, 2015. The predecessor project covered 3,262 villages in 16 districts where 92 percent
of villages, (or 2,987 of the 3,262) are functioning in an inclusive, transparent, and accountable manner.

The project development objective of NJLIP is to improve livelihoods of the poor and extreme poor people in selected districts. The NJLIP aims at providing support to
around 500,000 extreme poor and poor households in 2500 villages of 12 poverty-prone districts of the country. In addition 3,142 villages (excluding 120 villages
from where the project exited) of SIPP-II are also being supported through second-tier institutions called ‘Nuton Jibon Community Society’ (NJCS), which are formed
at cluster and district levels. Thus, 1,158,661 (including 658,661 HHs of SIPP-2) extreme poor and poor households of 5,642 villages of 88 Upazila in 22 districts are
directly benefitting from this project. More than 90 percent of the total beneficiaries are women.

The project will work on:
■■   Second generation activities in nine districts supported by SIPP II.
■■   Seven districts have ongoing SIPP II villages and new villages in additional Upazilas.
■■   Development of village institutions and livelihood in five new districts (Chandpur, Comilla, Khulna, Satkhira, Shariatpur and one Upazila from Gopalgonj.
■■   The non-negotiable project principles would be inclusion, equity, participation, transparency, and accountability, in addition to the 10 golden rules called “Dosh
     Neeti”. The Project also provides support for nutrition awareness, business partnership linkages, and employment generation.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   As of June 2016, the project has included 218,174 beneficiaries in addition to 526,928 beneficiaries of SIPP-2 bringing the total to 745,102 beneficiaries, which
     is 109% of the outreach estimation of 680,000 for FY 2016.
■■   A total of 12,344 vulnerable people (4.93 per village) were identified in the project areas of whom, 516 received one-time grant and 120 youths received training
     on skills development while 675 villages have prepared a youth database. A total of BDT 563.116 million was disbursed to 862 villages as a first installment of
     the Institution Development Fund (IDF).
■■   Gram Samiti Offices have been established in 462 villages although savings activity started in 1,628 villages.
■■   More than 93% (203,664) Nuton Jibon Group members are depositing savings on a regular basis.
■■   A total of BDT 18.52 million as savings has been accumulated and deposited into their bank accounts.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     To attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in export-oriented manufacturing, the Government of Bangladesh initiated an economic zones regime by enacting a law in
     1980 under which the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) was created.
     The EPZ model, catering mainly to export-oriented FDI, has its limits in terms of cumulative impact and spillovers to the domestic economy. As such, further
     improvements to the economic zones regime became imperative. To meet the investment need of both foreign and domestic investors, the government moved to a
     more flexible and competitive Special Economic Zone (SEZ) regime by introducing the Economic Zones Act, which was supported by the World Bank Group, in August
     2010. It led to the creation of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA).

     The World Bank Group, together with UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), is supporting the Government in developing Economic Zones through
     financing from the Bangladesh Private Sector Development Support Project. This project aims to
     ■■   Improve the business environment and access to serviced land through Economic Zones.
     ■■   Invest in training schemes to make human resources more responsive to enterprise needs.
     ■■   Support local private-sector capacity through product/process quality improvements.
     In April 2016, the Board approved an additional IDA credit of US$130 million. It became effective in August 2016. The additional financial will build on the gains
     realized by the original credit and contribute to enhancing the quality standards in the economic zones (EZs) and the governing institutions.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Generated $ 489 million in direct investment in the economic zones, against a target of $10 million.
     ■■   Generated &131 million direct investment by zone tenant companies located within new zones against a target of $10 million.
     ■■   Created 5,887 new jobs, of which 26.3 percent are for women, against a target of 2,000 jobs by June 2016 (30 percent for women).
     ■■   The Implementing Agencies (BEZA and BHTPA) has completed 33 site assessments, feasibility studies/master plans for new economic zones, with Mongla and
          Kaliakor awarded as the first zone/park under the public private partnership regime in the country.
     ■■   BEZA and BHTPA has issued 18 licenses to establish private sector-led SEZs and High-Tech parks in different parts of Bangladesh.
     ■■   BEPZA has certified 20 companies located in economic zones with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard through their green initiative. In addi-
          tion, BEPZA is maintaining 30 environmental and 60 social counselors to conduct social and environmental monitoring.
     ■■   BHTPA has trained about 12,139 people on industry-specific skills through their employment incentive and skill enhancement programs against a target of 2000.
          Through the Quality Company Certification program, about 38 firms have been certified by BHTPA with quality standards such as ISO: 9001, ISO: 27001, CMMI-3,
          and CMMI-5 exceeding the target of 30.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
There is growing recognition within the country that enhancing accountability and improving governance in the public sector is an important element in poverty
reduction, improving the investment climate, and accelerating private sector-led growth. It is estimated that public procurement expenditure of over US$ 6 billion
accounts for 60–80 percent of the annual development budget. Thus procurement plays a pivotal role in the development agenda of the country. Procurement was
identified as the main reason for poor utilization of aid and slow implementation of development programs. Given this context, the government initiated a systemic
procurement reform with a complete package of reforms focusing on legislation, capacity development, electronic government procurement (e-GP), and performance
measurement. This is the second phase of the reform.

The objective is to improve performance of the public procurement system progressively, focusing largely on the key sectoral ministries and their implementing
agencies. It follows on the successes of the first PPRP that supported the enactment of procurement laws and rules. The four components of PPRP II deal with
comprehensive capacity development, procurement performance monitoring, electronic procurement, and social accountability.

Besides Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), the nodal procurement agency, four key government agencies that share large part of the annual development
program are involved – the Roads and Highways Department, Local Government Engineering Department, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, and Bangladesh
Water Development Board. They processed over 90 percent of FY2015 procurement through electronic tendering with a target of 100 percent by 2016, including on-
line procurement performance monitoring. In addition, PPRP-II has been implementing a comprehensive capacity-building program along with a social accountability
and behavioral change communications campaign to demystify procurement at the grassroots level.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Improved efficiency: reduction of procurement delays with the award of contract within the initial bid validity period (2016: 83%, and 2007: 10%).
■■   Enhanced transparency: website publication of contract awards (2016: 91%, 2007: 7%); and website publication of bid invitations (2015: 100%, 2007: 70%).
■■   Minimized collusion/coercion/fraud: significant reduction in the frequency of newspaper reports of this in 2015 as against 2011; and insignificant number of
     complaints in e-GP in 2015 (less than 1% case) against substantial number in 2010-2013.
■■   Exponential growth of e-GP: number of registered bidders grown 40 fold (2016: 21,000, 2012: 525); number of bid invitations grown over 380 times (2016:
     55,000, 2012:144); value of bid invitations grown over 330 fold (2016: $6 billion, 2012: $18 million).
■■   Enhanced capacity development: three-week trained staff (2016: 7400; 2007: 1800); internationally certified MCIPS- UK (2016: 89; 2012: 0).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In 2010, nearly five million primary school-aged children were out of school in Bangladesh – many of these children had never enrolled, while others had dropped out
     before completing the primary cycle due to poverty. Children from the poorest quintile were reported to be disproportionately left out of the schooling system. These
     children were deprived of an education, reducing their chances of finding higher-earning jobs that could lift them and their families out of poverty. Building on the
     success of the first Reaching Out-of-School Children (ROSC) project, ROSC II provides a second chance at primary education to restore that opportunity.

     The project aims to improve equitable access, retention and completion in quality primary education for out-of-school children in selected under-served areas.

     ROSC II reintegrates out-of-school children into the education system through learning centers called Ananda schools (schools of joy), which are established in selected
     upazilas (sub-districts) with high-poverty and low-enrollment and completion rates. As ROSC students tend to be older, teachers observe a flexible schedule, with
     students taught by a single class teacher until they are ready to join mainstream secondary schools. These centers also provide education stipends to students to lessen
     the financial burden on families, in addition to providing free books, stationery, and school uniforms. The project builds upon the experiences of both public and NGOs
     and blends formal education with non-formal means of delivery to the young learners, providing them with an opportunity to complete grade five and transition
     to secondary education. The project also tries to empower disadvantaged rural communities to establish, own, and manage Ananda schools with support from the
     government and local education NGOs. In addition, the project aims to pilot initiatives in selected urban slums for child domestics, a pre-vocational skills training
     scheme for older ROSC students, and an Early Grade Reading program for current ROSC students.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS
     ■■   Enrollment of 690,000 out-of-school children (49 percent girls and 87 percent from disadvantaged families) in 20,400 supported learning centers in 148 of the
          most disadvantaged upazilas and 3,100 children in 17 urban slums of Dhaka.
     ■■   A total of 919 ROSC students and graduates are being given prevocational training for self-employment.
     ■■   Average grade retention rate stands at 64 percent, with the attendance rate at 87 percent and teacher absence rate below 15 percent.
     ■■   A total of 19,377 teachers have been given foundation training and 4,000 center management committee members have been trained for the operation and
          management of learning centers.
     ■■   Most Ananda schools have water and sanitation facilities, and 80 percent of teachers at them are women.
     ■■   For the first time, ROSC students participated in the 2013 national learning assessment for the primary level.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Low revenue mobilization is limiting the country’s development aspirations as the level of tax collection was 10 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012
and has remained at that level over the last few years.
The tax system is complex, which has been fueling a non-compliance environment. A particular problem is that the indirect tax system is distortionary, discretionary,
and narrow based.
Tax administration is lagging in embracing good international practices, especially in terms of simplified business processes, adoption of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), risk management systems, modern Human Resources Management (HRM) systems. In general it is performing poorly in
transparency and accountability. The new Value Added Tax VAT Law to take effect in July 2017 has the objective of simplifying the tax system especially the indirect
tax system through the implementation of a single rate, few tax exemptions, a voluntary threshold for small business registration, and a simplification of the Excise &
Duty regime according to international practices.

The program’s objective is to improve revenue mobilization and transparency in the VAT administration. The program will support the VAT Law implementation by
preparing both the tax administration and the taxpayers’ community for the Law adoption.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS
■■    Most of the core new business processes have been reviewed and cleared by the National Bureau of Revenue (NBR)
■■    The associated software development has been initiated and some Users Acceptance Tests (UAT) have been completed for the registration module. It is expected
      that the registration module will be launched in January 2017.
■■    Several interactions with selected taxpayers have been carried out in order to get feedback on the VAT rules especially regarding the public advance ruling and
      private advance ruling.
■■    Continual coordination with the Bangladesh Bank and the Public Accounts Office has been implemented in order to define interfaces and protocols for VAT
      electronic payments.
■■    Several workshops and orientation sessions have been implemented to orient the taxpayers’ community on the VAT Law and get feedback from them to improve,
      simplify, and clarify the VAT rules and regulations.
■■    Independent verification completed for DLR 1.2.1 as the first DLI achieved under the program and the disbursement process is underway.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     National rural water supply coverage in Bangladesh is estimated to be around 97 percent, but water quality issues and contamination by arsenic have effectively
     lowered this figure to around 83 percent. Arsenic is the single largest threat to safe water service provision in Bangladesh. The quality of sanitation coverage is another
     area of concern, with only 37 percent of latrines being hygienic. The poor infrastructure and facilities for water and sanitation services, along with increased demand,
     is making it difficult to provide reliable water and sanitation services.
     The project aims to increase the provision of safe water supply and hygienic sanitation in selected rural areas of Bangladesh.

     It calls for scaling up piped and non-piped water facilities to provide safe and clean water to villagers in some 383 Union Parishads (local governing units) with acute
     arsenic contamination and low coverage for safe water supply. The project also seeks to provide hygienic sanitation facilities, and is financing the construction of 35
     piped water supply schemes and 14,000 water point sources in hot-spot upazilas (subdistricts) where piped water supply is not economically possible. To fight the poor
     sanitation, it intends to provide financial incentives for the poor to construct hygienic latrines, build local private-sector capacity so that markets can better react to rise
     in demand; and increase the government’s role in ensuring that latrines are maintained and accessible to all. The project is financing installation of 50,000 latrines
     for selected poor households.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■    748,000 out of target 924,000 people in rural areas have been provided with access to improved water sources.
     ■■    11,900 out of 14,000 improved community water points constructed under the project.
     ■■    493 out of 28,000 new piped household water connections provided from the project.
     ■■    201,000 people out of 275,000 have been provided with access to hygienic latrines.
     ■■    Total 948,000 direct project beneficiaries out of target 1.2 million people in rural areas have been provided with access to improved water sources and hygienic
           latrines.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Only about 66 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent and prolonged power cuts. Currently,
electricity supply is about 8,500-9,000megawatts (MW), against a peak demand of about 10,000 MW. The dispersed nature of rural settlements and the numerous
rivers that crisscross the country make grid electrification in many areas of Bangladesh difficult and expensive. Despite steady progress in enhancing coverage, it is clear
that reliance on grid electricity alone will not allow the Bangladeshi government to realize its vision of universal access to electricity by 2021.
The second Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) project aims to increase access to clean energy in rural areas of Bangladesh.

It builds on the success of RERED I by supporting solar home systems and other renewable energy options in remote rural areas, where grid electricity is not
economically or geographically viable. The World Bank initiative led to support from other donors, and about 3.95 million rural homes and shops are getting electricity
access through the solar home system. The implementing agency is the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd. (IDCOL), a government-owned financing institution,
and 47 partner organizations (mostly non-government organizations) are installing solar home systems through a micro-credit scheme Replicating the success of the
solar home systems program, the project is also supporting renewable energy based mini-grids,, solar irrigation pumps (replacing diesel pumps), dissemination of
improved cook stoves, and biogas digesters for cooking.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Provided 3.95 million remote households and rural shops with solar home systems, with 20,000 systems being installed every month.
■■   Increased access to electricity in Bangladesh by 14 percent.
■■   7 mini-grids are currently providing 24/7 electricity to 2,000 rural businesses and shops. Another 9 are under construction.
■■   320 solar irrigation pumps are under operation benefiting 8,000 farmers with reliable and affordable irrigation services.
■■   750,000 rural women are benefiting from improved cook stoves with more than 70,000 improved cook stoves being sold every month.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Only about 66 percent of rural households in Bangladesh have access to grid electricity, and even these consumers suffer frequent and prolonged power cuts.
     Currently, electricity supply is about 8,500-9,000 megawatts (MW), against a peak demand of about 10,000 MW. Electricity availability and the number of consumers
     have grown steadily in recent time. While the government made substantial investments to extend the rural low-voltage system network to support new connections,
     the rural medium-voltage distribution system and the associated transmission system received relatively less attention. As a result, the rural electricity system is now
     over-loaded and experiences frequent load-shedding, leading to higher technical losses and services interruptions.

     The objective is to reduce system losses and enhance capacity in the rural distribution network, primarily in the eastern part of Bangladesh.

     The project aims to rehabilitate and augment the distribution network of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) in support of reducing systems losses and
     enhancing capacity for carrying additional electricity. The project is also supporting transmission enhancements by the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB).

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The project is on track to meet its development objectives. 1,000 km of line construction has been completed against the project target of 6,000 km by 2020. All major
     contracts for line materials and substations have either been awarded or under evaluation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The local governments of Bangladesh, the key components of community development, have largely improved their transparency and accountability in the delivery
of services with stronger public financial management through the implementation of the Second Local Governance Support Project (LGSP II). By developing Union
Parishad (UP, the lowest tier of local government) capacities, strengthening accountability systems, and improving participation at the grassroots level, there is an
increasing trend towards the decentralization of government, meaning local governments have more autonomy and resources. The Second Local Government Support
Project (LGSP II), the second nation-wide effort to strengthen the local government system in Bangladesh, has been successful in achieving its objectives of improving
the accountability and responsiveness of UPs, along with placing an emphasis on the enhancement of citizen engagement and women’s participation in decision-
making at the local level.

Project Objective and Compoents:
The development objective of the LGSP II is to strengthen inclusive and accountable institutions of local governance through a more efficient and transparent
intergovernmental fiscal system. Grants administered and closely monitored by the LGSP II, have allowed the UPs to solve local problems and reach community goals
with transparent spending and financial management. By empowering communities to make choices on their development priorities and basic service needs, and in
addition, empowering local governments to respond to community priorities, the project not only enhanced UP’s capacity to provide better services to the people on
the local level, but also ensured participation of local citizens in planning, implementation and monitoring of development activities, especially women.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
Transfers of Basic Block Grants (BBGs) and Performance Based Grants (PBGs) as planned.
■■    Government of Bangladesh’s share of total BBG increased to the agreed 60% before completion of the project.
■■    Financial and Performance audits of all 4,550 UPs carried out annually, with improved audit quality.
■■    Capacity building training provided to District officials and UP functionaries on an on-going basis.
■■    Continued promotion of active citizen participation and transparency by Ward Committees (WCs) and Scheme Supervision Committees (SSCs), women’s develop-
      ment forums, and open budget meetings.
■■    Development of Management Information System (MIS) software and its operation.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Despite remarkable progress in poverty reduction, extreme poverty in Bangladesh remains high, with large numbers of people vulnerable to systemic shocks. The
     Government of Bangladesh recognizes that shocks and vulnerability are mainstream problems for the poor and has currently implements several safety net programs
     as response measures. Well designed and implemented safety nets not only reduce poverty and vulnerability but have shown to improve women’s wellbeing. Yes
     despite the numerous ongoing interventions, large numbers of poor people remain out of reach of safety nets. There is a scope for better targeting of benefits in
     some of the largest programs, improving delivery mechanisms and monitoring systems, as well as enhancing transparency measures. Cognizant of these existing
     challenges, the Ministry of Disaster Management & Relief (MoDMR) which implements approximately one-third of the country’s social protection budget, is currently
     utilizing IDA resources to improve performance of its major programs. The Statistics & Informatics Division (SID) is also supporting this process, given its mandate to
     develop a national household database (NHD) towards better targeting of social assistance, which in the medium term is also expected to improve the quality of a
     significant portion of public expenditure on safety net programs.

     The Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) Project aims to improve the equity, efficiency and transparency of major safety net programs to benefit the poorest
     households. Component 1 (Support to MoDMR Safety Net Programs) provides performance-based partial reimbursement of government spending under selected
     safety net programs; Component 2 (Strengthening of MoDMR Program Administration & Transparency) provides resources to improve implementation quality,
     including the development of management information systems, beneficiary outreach and engagement strategies, training, etc. towards the achievement of higher
     level objectives; and Component 3 (Development of the National Household Database) provides resources to conduct a nationwide census, establish a comprehensive
     targeting system, and contribute to improving coordination among various safety nets programs.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Improved pro-poor targeting of financial resources of major safety net programs
     ■■   Improved field level implementation and monitoring capacity of major safety net programs
     ■■   Improved transparency measures by piloting digital payments and grievance reporting
     ■■   Approved Operations Manual and data collection strategy for the NHD

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Special measures taken over the last couple of decades have enabled more Bangladeshi children than before, especially girls, to continue their education at the
secondary level. But it still remains a challenge for children from low-income families to access a good-quality education.
The Secondary Education Quality and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) aims to improve the quality of secondary education, systematically monitor learning
outcomes and increase access and equity in 215 project upazilas (sub-districts).
The project provides stipends and tuition to disadvantaged girls and boys based on proxy means-testing (PMT), in addition to incentives to students, teachers, and
schools in 215 upazilas to encourage them to perform better. Eligible students receive stipends of $15 to $40 a year if they maintain 75 percent average attendance,
achieve a passing grade in final examinations and remain unmarried until they complete Grade 10.
The project also includes measures to provide water and sanitation facilities in schools, and strengthen school management and accountability systems while helping
to develop stronger reading habits. Financial rewards are given to the teachers and institutions that consistently increase the number of students appearing in and
passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   The pass rate in SSC examinations was higher than 75 percent.
■■   Supported 8.4 million student-years (55 percent girls) under the stipends program.
■■   More than 4,068 institutions were supported under the SSC institution award.
■■   Awarded more than 386,000 students for academic performance while supporting some 1.1 million students in English and mathematics and about 6.1 million
     students in developing a reading habit.
■■   95% of the project institutions have received Improving School Facilities (ISF) grants.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Despite a wide road network and large investments in it, rural roads in Bangladesh need regular repair and rehabilitation. The quality, construction, and carrying
     capacity of parts of the secondary and tertiary road network are poor. This has road safety implications for the rural residents, many of whom live on the margin. In
     terms of opportunity though, these road networks are means to education, health and livelihood for about 66% of population, who live in rural Bangladesh. Despite
     this suboptimal state juxtaposed against the opportunity, large portion of the secondary and tertiary road networks remain impassable during the rainy season, more
     so given the deltaic nature of the country and more frequent extreme weather events.

     Project Objective and Components:

     The objective of the project is to improve rural accessibility (connectivity) in project areas (covering 26 districts) and strengthening institutional capacity for sustainable
     rural road maintenance.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   The project has over 600 civil works contracts, 99% to be e-procured;
     ■■   3,060km out of 5,248 km of Upazila and Union roads has been completed to facilitate rural connectivity through improvement (new roads) and rehabilitation
          works;
     ■■   450km of performance-based maintenance contract roads have been awarded which will be maintained for next five years;
     ■■   Pilot work of one inland waterway and 8 Growth Centre Markets have been completed;
     ■■   “Rural Road Safety Manual” has been developed under this project;
     ■■   Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has signed most of the consultancy contracts under the institutional strengthening and capacity building and
          governance component of the project. Implementation of those contracts is either ongoing or completed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Electricity demand in Bangladesh has increased at an average rate of 10 percent per annum in recent years, with peak demand reaching about 9,500 megawatts (MW).
Yet per capita generation remains among the lowest in the world (300 kilowatt hours), and present generation capacity at around 8,500 MW falls far short of peak
demand. Although the supply situation has improved recently, availability and reliability of supply are the key issues. Load shedding and outages occur in irrigation/
summer season that affect households, commercial enterprises, and industries. The sector is financially weak, access to capital is severely constrained and prices do
not cover costs, necessitating large government subsidies to keep the key institutions operational. Increasing shortages of natural gas, the primary fuel for power
generation, have added to the sector’s challenges.
The Siddhirganj Power Project aims to increase electricity supply to the Bangladesh power-grid network by constructing a 335 MW combined cycle power plant, (CCPP)
as well as an 11-kilometer 230-kilovolt power evacuation system, and a 60 km 30-inch gas transmission pipeline. The combined cycle design of the power plant is a
comparatively cleaner technology with lower heat emissions and higher thermal efficiency.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   By November, 2016 mple cycle power plant is expected to add 217 MW to the national grid.
■■   The steam cycle of the power plant is scheduled to complete in August, 2017 when it will add total 335 MW capacity to the grid.
■■   Construction of the power evacuation system is complete, and it is transferring 235 MW of electricity from the other power plants of Siddhirganj to the greater
     Dhaka area.
■■   The gas line is almost complete and has improved the gas supply situation in the Siddhirganj region.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Bangladesh economy has been registering steady economic growth of around 6 percent over the past decade. As local and global economic shifts continue toward
     industry and services, demand for skilled manpower is expected to rise at home and abroad. Bangladesh is a labor-surplus country, so the government is increasingly
     focusing on workforce development through technical and vocational education training (TVET). This is a timely response as the country prepares to accommodate
     and capitalize on the ongoing demographic dividend. However, poor training quality, low employability, and inadequate wages plague the TVET sector, requiring
     interventions.

     The project aims to strengthen selected public and private training institutions to improve training quality and employability of trainees, including those from
     disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. It is designed to address the key issues concerning TVET in a number of ways:
     ■■   Ensuring that the programs offered are relevant to labor market needs by incorporating views from industries and civil society.
     ■■   Helping to ensure teacher-trainer vacancies open for six months or more are filled.
     ■■   Breaking new ground, supporting both public and private institutions to create a level playing field.
     ■■   Providing various incentives to the institutions. Based on performance indicators, training institutions grant of up to $1 million for implementing their institu-
          tional development plans;. Institutions providing short courses receive $275 per student, of which $75 is stipend to the student. A 20 percent per student amount
          performance grant is offered to the institute for each trainee who is employed within six months of completing training.
     ■■   Providing stipends to students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Those receiving a stipend must maintain 75 percent annual attendance and 45
          percent pass marks in the annual examinations.
     ■■   Strengthening polytechnic teaching and management through specialized training programs for polytechnic teachers and managers in collaboration with Sin-
          gapore.
     ■■   Supporting sustainable implementation capacities and governance at all levels of skills development system;
     ■■   Facilitating changed mind sets among the institutions, who now initiate and lead innovations, and among students and communities towards increasing the
          value of technical education in society and
     ■■   Increasing harmony among formerly-fragmented skills development stakeholders and forging global partnerships.

     ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   144,615 diploma students from 100 polytechnic institutions (50 of which are public) received stipends. Female beneficiary share increased from 10% to 26%
          from adopting universal female stipend instead of poverty targeting one.
     ■■   73,753 trainees have received short-course training, of whom, 27% are women.
     ■■   173 full-time contractual teachers deployed in 50 public polytechnics, filling up 95% of vacant teaching posts, and around 1,200 polytechnic teachers trained.
     ■■   140 managers and 120 polytechnic teachers trained in Singapore.
     ■■   Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) has been operationalized, and around 9,000 individuals have been assessed through RPL.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Illegal trade in wildlife is largely controlled by criminal gangs that poach flagship species such as tigers and elephants in one country, stockpile them in another, and then
trade them beyond the South Asia region. No single country can eliminate poaching or the illegal wildlife trade on its own. Since wild animals cannot be confined to national
boundaries, a single country also cannot manage a contiguous cross-border wildlife habitat effectively. This makes the control of the illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife parts a
challenging multi-country affair.

The project aims to assist participating governments in building or enhancing shared capacity, institutions, knowledge and incentives to collaborate on tackling the illegal wildlife
trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas. It has a two-pronged approach that calls for: (i) capacity building to address the illegal wildlife
trade through regional cooperation; and (ii) habitat protection and management to generate regional conservation benefits and address the human-wildlife conflict.

Components are:
■■   Building capacity to address the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade by bringing about regional collaboration in combating wildlife crime through strengthened legislative
     and regulatory frameworks and well-equipped specialized agencies and systems, as well as relevant training and awareness programs for staff responsible for enforcement
     of wildlife laws and regulations. Bangladesh and Nepal are participating in the first phase (with the Nepal project amounting to $3 million) and Bhutan joined in the second
     phase.
■■   Promoting wildlife conservation in Asia through establishing a virtual regional center of excellence; improving existing park infrastructure; conducting species monitoring
     and recovery programs; preparing and implementing endangered species recovery plans; protecting inviolate areas for species conservation; implementing real-time
     field-based monitoring systems; developing landscape scale imaging platforms; strengthening enforcement of laws and regulations; and carrying out innovative research
     projects in wildlife conservation.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Drafted 21 rules for operationalization of Wildlife Act 2012 and gazetted two Vulture Safe Zones in Bangladesh.
■■   Established Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU) at the Forest Department Head Quarter and Divisional Offices for combating illegal wildlife trafficking and other wildlife
     related crimes.
■■   Established Wildlife Center for undertaking research, training, and outreach for wildlife conservation.
■■   Established inter-agency coordination among WCCU, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Border Guard, Coast Guard, Customs, Police, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in com-
     bating wildlife and forest crime
■■   Completed the first census of Bengal Tigers in the Sundarbans using camera trapping method.
■■   Piloted SMART paroling in the Sundarbans to protect the remaining 106 tiger population in the Sundarbans.
■■   Identified elephant routes and corridors in the border areas to reduce human-elephant conflict.
■■   Commenced implementation of 37 sub-projects aiming to improve the management of protected areas, conservation of flagship species and reduce human-wildlife conflict.
■■   Completed Wildlife Master Plan, 5 Protected Area Management Plans and 3 Eco-Tourism Management Plans.
■■   Organized two regional thematic meetings on “Institutional arrangements for wildlife crime control” and “Human- wildlife conflict management” in 2015.
■■   Completed training, certificate and diploma courses on combating wildlife crime and wildlife management.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bangladesh had made remarkable progress in primary education in the last decade. The net enrollment rate (NER) reached around 98 percent while the gross enrollment
     rate (GER) reached above 108 percent in 2014, and gender parity was achieved. The completion rate was 79 percent in 2014 and the survival rate to Grade 5 is 81 percent.
     Despite the impressive progress, transition rate to secondary level remain a concern. Poverty along with educational background of the family, remoteness of the society,
     and distance from the school, were the main reasons for dropping out. The quality of education remained a bigger concern; many schools were overcrowded, while teacher
     qualifications and motivation remained low and exams mostly tested memory recall and rote learning.

     The Third Primary Education Development Program (PEDP3) aims at increased participation and reduced social disparities in primary education, increased completion of
     primary education, improved quality of the learning environment, systematic assessment of student learning, and improved effectiveness of resource utilization at the
     primary education sector. The program has introduced a comprehensive set of reforms to upgrade the quality of learning for all children at the primary and preprimary level,
     strengthened capacity to provide high-quality data and utilization of information for effective results monitoring, brought disadvantaged children into pre-primary and
     primary education, and developed mechanisms for the public and private sectors to work more closely together in education service delivery.
     The program builds on the experience and successes of previous programs but stands out from them because its financing is linked to specific results being achieved
     on the ground. Funds are disbursed when disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) covering nine areas are met. The DLIs for quality enhancement cover: (i) development
     of an 18-month diploma program and teacher training; (ii) the development and incremental introduction of competency-based examinations; (iii) merit-based teacher
     and head teacher recruitment; and (iv) timely distribution of textbooks (within a month of the start of the academic calendar), including an updated curriculum. The DLIs
     supporting reduction in disparities include: (i) the widespread introduction of pre-primary education, especially in disadvantaged areas; and (ii) needs-based infrastructure
     development to reduce overcrowding in schools and improve the quality of the facilities as well as school-level planning. Two other DLIs are set for enhanced sector financing
     and effective program monitoring and reporting.

     The World Bank is also the supervising entity for a Global Partnership for Education grant of $100 million for PEDP3.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Achievement of 39 out of the 44 year 0 to year 4 DLI targets.
     ■■   Completion of three rounds of the National Student Assessments (Grades 3 and 5) in 2011, 2013, 2015.
     ■■   Teacher recruitment and deployment completed according to merit-based recruitment procedures.
     ■■   Introduction of competency based questions in the Primary Education Completion Exams (PECE)
     ■■   International standard diploma in education piloted and expanded nationwide (accredited by the University of Dhaka).
     ■■   Receipt of textbooks within the first month of the academic year by over 90 percent of primary schools.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Although Bangladesh is rich in natural gas reserves, current gas production is below demand due to a low level of exploration work and inadequate gas transmission
systems. Availability of gas through further gas exploration works will likely to take longer time. About one third of the available generation capacity in Bangladesh
is based on gas-based steam cycle technology, operating at very low efficiency. In line with the apparent shortages in natural gas production, the government has
prioritized to improve the efficiency of the existing gas based power plants. This project is a step forward in that direction.

The project objective is to increase generation capacity and efficiency of the targeted power plant. The key activity of the Project is to convert Unit 4, one of the four 210
MW gas-fired steam units at Ghorashal Power Station (GPS), into a combined cycle unit for an upgraded total capacity of 409 MW. The steam unit is currently generating
170MW and the overall efficiency of the unit is around 31%. The Project would increase the overall efficiency of the unit to 54% and the generation output will also be
more than doubled with only 18% increase in gas requirement. Fuel consumption (per GWh) would be reduced by 44%, which would also lead to lower greenhouse
gas emissions. The Technical Assistance (TA) component would finance an Owner’s Engineer for the Project and also focus on capacity building and institutional support
to the power plant as well as Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   210 MW gas-fired steam units converted into a 409 MW combined cycle unit
■■   Overall efficiency increased to 54% from the current efficiency level of 30%
■■   303 PJ fuel savings in Projected lifetime
■■   311,936 tCO2e reduction in GHG emissions over the project life

     term growth. Bangladesh needs to develop a financial sector that is stable, inclusive, and capable of providing efficient financial intermediation to the productive
     sectors of the economy, facilitating capital accumulation and investment to generate faster growth. In addition, given the importance of the manufacturing sector and
     of the export sector, it is particularly important to cater to the evolving financing needs of these sectors through increased financial intermediation.

     The project development objective is to improve financial market infrastructure, the regulatory and oversight capacity of Bangladesh Bank, and the access to long-term
     financing for private firms in Bangladesh. This will be accomplished through components aimed at strengthening financial market infrastructure; improving regulatory,
     supervisory, and sector developmental capacity of BB; and building the market for and scaling up long-term finance especially to exporters and manufacturing firms
     to spur competitiveness, investment, and growth.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
A number of SOBs in Bangladesh are significant financial institutions because of their size, outreach, developmental impact, and interconnectedness. Performance
of the SOBs as a group is significant for financial stability in Bangladesh; furthermore, their underperformance has a meaningful fiscal impact. These banks are
systemically important not only with regard to assets but also due to their widespread retail presence, which is crucial for financial inclusion. Their overall operations
need to be automated to enhance data integrity and security, internal efficiency, and competitiveness.
Addressing deficiencies in owning, managing, and regulating the SOBs presents big opportunities. The explicit and implicit government support, trust toward them
by the savers, and enhanced governance and performance would allow the SOBs to expand their long-term funding operations. The SOBs can be at the forefront of
expanding financial inclusion in Bangladesh and are well placed to further pursue the unfinished agenda of inclusion. Stronger SOBs would reduce vulnerabilities in
the financial system and open the market to more competition, benefiting financial sector consumers and the broader economy.
The project will support Bangladesh’s efforts to develop the financial sector and enhance its stability. By modernizing the state-owned banks (SOBs), the Government
of Bangladesh (GOB) aims to achieve: (a) a more stable financial system; (b) better access to finance in the society; (c) improved governance of the SOBs; and (d) lower
fiscal outlays to recapitalize them.

The project will address the identified weaknesses of the SOBs in the areas of risk management, internal control, financial reporting, and resource management
(including planning for staff training). It will also lead to improved bank data quality, developing better financial reporting and enhancing internal resource
management and control. More specifically, the SOBs are expected to enhance their institutional capacity to better monitor and manage various risks in their daily
operations and capture all the economic activities relating to their operations and provide timely financial information to meet the needs of stakeholders both inside
and outside the SOBs.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bangladesh is one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. It is highly exposed to a variety of hazards, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges, and earthquakes. The
     GoB has shown that proactively investing in Disaster Risk Management saves lives, reduces economic losses, and protects development gains. The GoB has successfully
     instituted disaster risk reduction policies and invested in infrastructure along coastal areas to mitigate the risk from floods and cyclones. Despite these gains, the
     vulnerability of Bangladesh’s urban areas is not as well understood, or addressed, in the country’s policy framework. With 7 million people living in Dhaka and 15
     million living in the wider Metropolitan area, Dhaka is particularly at risk. Land use planning regulations, and public service delivery in the urban areas have failed
     to keep up with the pace of growth. The current regulatory environment is somewhat opaque and the enforcement mechanisms for urban development control do
     not address structural safety, creating an environment that lacks practical enforcement capability and accountability. In this context, physical and social vulnerabilities
     keep increasing and any hazards, such as floods, fires, building collapses, or earthquakes, present a formidable threat to life and prosperity. City-level actors are critical
     protagonists in the effort to develop resilient and livable cities in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Urban Resilience Project seeks to create an enabling environment for
     coordinated, locally managed disaster risk management based on three core pillars of disaster resilience in an urban settings: i) effectively respond to urban disasters;
     ii) reinforce existing infrastructure; and iii) ensure resilient construction. The project has five components:
     ■■   To reinforce the emergency management response capacity.
     ■■   To develop the consensus-driven analytical foundation required for longer-term investments to reduce risk in the built environment of Dhaka, Sylhet and other
          cities through the vulnerability assessment of critical and essential facilities.
     ■■   To put in place the institutional infrastructure and competency to reduce long-term disaster vulnerability in Dhaka, through improved construction, urban plan-
          ning and development.
     ■■   Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation.
     ■■   The Contingent Emergency Response Component, under which following an adverse natural or man-made event that causes a major disaster, the GoB may
          request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to this component to support response and reconstruction.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   68 wards will be facilitated with decentralized emergency response services in Dhaka (DNCC/DSCC)
     ■■   20 wards will be facilitated with decentralized emergency response services in Sylhet
     ■■   12 multi-agency exercises and drills will be completed by final year of the project
     ■■   12 emergency management warehouses equipped with specialized search and rescue equipment will be built for FSCD
     ■■   Two fixed control rooms, 12 emergency management warehouses and 17 auxiliary control rooms will be constructed and/or renovated for FSCD.
     ■■   10 emergency management warehouses, two emergency operations centers, three disaster risk management offices, 10 zonal control rooms, one urban resil-
          ience unit will be constructed and/or renovated for DNCC/DSCC/SCC facilities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone and climate vulnerable countries in the world. It is regularly exposed to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones
associated with storm surges, floods, severe thunderstorms and drought. While Bangladesh has made impressive gains in a number of social indicators, these stand
to be jeopardized unless substantial investments are made in strengthening disaster preparedness, early warning systems, and services based on weather, water and
climate information. At present, the Bangladesh Meteorology Department (BMD) can issue only 24-hour general weather forecasts and does not have the required
land, ocean or atmospheric observation network, hardware, software or human resource capacity for issuing accurate short term weather or longer range climate
forecasts that can be used at the national level or regional levels. The hydrological network, managed by the Hydrology Division of the Bangladesh Water Development
Board (BWDB), remains primarily manual with manual data collection, transmission and storage with only limited real time hydrological and flood forecasting. Even
though the weather and water dependent agriculture sector that contributes to almost 16 percent of the country’s GDP and provides employment to about 60 percent
of the people, farmers in Bangladesh do not get any systematic agro-meteorological advisories or bulletins to be able to make appropriate decisions and adjust to
weather variability at the farm level. Through investments in monitoring systems, forecasting and services, this project makes a critical contribution to strengthening
disaster preparedness and climate resilience in Bangladesh and also contributes to development of weather based information services that are expected to support
decision-making in key productive sectors in the country.
The project development objective is to strengthen Government of Bangladesh’s capacity to deliver reliable weather, water and climate information services and
improve access to such services by priority sectors and communities. The project comprises of four components:
■■   Strengthen meteorological information services,
■■   Strengthen hydrological information services and the early warning system
■■   Develop agrometeorological information systems
■■   The Contingent Emergency Response Component, which enables that following an adverse natural or man-made event that causes a major disaster, the GoB may
     request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to this component to support response and reconstruction.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Improved forecasting of weather patterns and extreme events
■■   Development and provision of agromet information services to farmer groups
■■   Enhanced access to early warnings for significant weather and water hazards by vulnerable communities

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     While Bangladesh has made significant strides over the past two decades in reducing poverty, around 21 percent of Bangladesh’s urban population continue to live
     below the poverty line. More than eight million Bangladeshis live on less than $2 per day and housing and sanitation remain a huge challenge for the poor living in
     cities. The Low Income Housing Support Project aims to engage government, local community and private sectors to provide affordable housing and sanitation facility
     for the poor.

     Poor urban households live in inadequate and insecure houses, often in unsanitary conditions and face difficulties in accessing employment, made worse by having
     little or no social protection. With one of the highest urbanization rates in Asia, the situation continues to worsen for an increasing number of urban poor. Promoting
     the inclusion of the urban poor into growing opportunities in cities can help to promote growth and shared prosperity.

     The Low Income Community Housing Support Project is a pilot program that builds on organized and networked communities supported by various urban poverty
     programs. It will bring together government systems, local communities and private lenders in a community-based and flexible approach to secure tenure, improve
     onsite infrastructure, and extend affordable housing loans leveraging community systems. The project is expected to cover three municipalities in its pilot phase,
     benefitting around 24,000 urban poor. The project will also advance the development of affordable housing microfinance products.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   The project will benefit around 120,000 beneficiaries with improved access to services
     ■■   The project will benefit around 40,000 beneficiaries with improved housing
     ■■   Affordable housing microfinance products provided to the beneficiaries
     ■■   The project was approved by the Government of Bangladesh on May 10, 2016 and signed on June 30, 2016. The Financing Agreement has been approved, and
          Subsidiary Agreements with both Implementing Agencies are expected to be signed by September 2016.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES :
Improving skills and productivity are crucial to Bangladesh’s quest to accelerate economic growth and become a middle-income country. However, the current skill
levels of the labor force are unlikely to support future market demands. While there is an abundance of low-skilled workers, there is a strong demand for graduates with
higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills and job-specific technical skills. This would require improving the quality and relevance of tertiary education so that education
institutions are equipped to produce graduates with more market relevant skills.

The National University (NU) college system accounts for about 1.6 million, i.e. nearly two-third of all tertiary students across 1,731 affiliated government and
nongovernment colleges in Bangladesh. The NU’s large number of government and nongovernment colleges, enrollment, and extensive network make it critical for
improving the education sector.

The project’s objective is to strengthen the strategic planning and management capacity of the college education subsector and to improve the teaching and learning
environment of participating colleges. As a first CEDP will focus on building up the National University college system’s capacity to plan, manage, implement, and
monitor their institutional programs and strengthening the foundation for the next phase of development activities. The project supports the development of a
Strategic Plan for the College Subsector, to provide directions and goals for the college education subsector and a consensus-based plan of action.

Through the availability of competitive grants, CEDP promotes institution-led activities that focus on creating a quality teaching learning environment in government
and non-government colleges. The Institutional Development Grants will focus on areas, such as: upgrading basic teaching-learning facilities and Internet connectivity;
improving market relevance of college education through development of soft skills of students and linkages with the industry/employers, introducing quality
assurance and strengthening management capacity and upgrade of the fiduciary system in the colleges.
 The IDG activities will help provide government and education practitioners insight on the planning, management, and implementation capacity of participating
colleges, informing the strategic plan, policy, and operations of the subsector.

CEDP promotes professional development of teachers through training offered through the establishment of a Training Consortium. The Training Consortium comprises
of national training-offering agencies and the University of Nottingham as international partner to ensure global best practices in teacher training. Additionally, the
project aims to fill teacher vacancies in government colleges and improve recruitment process of teachers for non-government colleges.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   The Project is expected to be effective and commence implementation by September 30, 2016.
■■   The first Strategic Plan for the College Subsector to be prepared is expected to guide the tertiary college subsector.
■■   More than 100 competitive institutional development grants to be awarded to government and non-government colleges for improving teaching learning
     environment.
■■   Around 8,000 teachers and managers to give professional development training to bring academic excellence.
■■   Around 2,700 vacant teacher posts to be filled in the government colleges.
