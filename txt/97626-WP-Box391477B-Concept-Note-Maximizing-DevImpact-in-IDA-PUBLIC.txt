                                Concept Note
        IEG Learning Product on Maximizing Development Impact in IDA
                                                      May 27, 2015

Background and Context

1.      The International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank Group’s (WBG)
fund for the poorest countries. It is replenished every three years by contributions from the
governments of the richer member countries, repayments of IDA credits, and contributions from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC).

2.       The sixteenth IDA replenishment (IDA16) covered the FY12-14 period. The discussions
for the seventeenth replenishment (IDA17) covering FY15-17 were completed in December
2013 and the final report (the IDA17 Replenishment Report)1 was approved by the Executive
Directors of IDA on March 25, 2014. Early in this period Bank management will deliver its
IDA16 Retrospective (expected to be completed in June 2015), with a subsequent IDA17 mid-
term review half-way through the implementation period. A meeting of the IDA Deputies that is
now planned for March 2016 will review the progress in IDA 17 implementation and also be the
first replenishment meeting for IDA18. As set out in the IEG FY15-17 work program and budget
document2 IEG will also make available, for this meeting, a synthesis (“the Product”) which
brings together findings from recent IEG evaluations pertinent to the core themes of IDA 17.

Product Concept and Purpose

3.      Numerous IEG evaluations address issues that are relevant to IDA’s development impact.
With the aim of helping to inform the discussions for the IDA18 replenishment, the planned
report will use a desk exercise to bring such issues together by compiling and synthesizing
relevant evaluation evidence from recently completed IEG evaluations and those expected to be
completed in FY15 and early FY16. This synthesis report will, in this manner, compile and
present such IEG evaluation findings that are relevant for IDA or IDA countries, with particular
attention to the special themes under IDA16 and 17 (para 6 below). It will not be an evaluation
of IDA performance, it will not report on IDA progress or on replenishment commitments, and
will not make recommendations on IDA policy issues (such as graduation criteria as one
example). The preparation of the product will be based on desk work without new field work or
new analyses, except for an updated portfolio analysis.

Rationale and Objective

4.      IEG’s independent evaluations focus primarily on specific issues of development
effectiveness and provide insight into what works and on strengths and weaknesses of current
approaches. Each individual evaluation addresses specific sets of topics across types of clients
and country circumstances, often covering IDA countries as part of a wider spectrum of Bank
country partners. In contrast, the IEG learning products synthesize and disseminate IEG
evaluation work. The planned synthesis product will in this vein consider the various available
evaluation findings through the IDA lens by drawing from the available individual evaluations
such specific findings, lessons and conclusions on development effectiveness that are directly
applicable for current IDA clients and in particular for the key topics of IDA16 and 17. These
findings will be identified and set in context with attention to connectivities in a concise, reader-
friendly format, with special attention to forward-looking aspects. The synthesis product will be
of direct relevance for the preparations and discussions regarding the forthcoming IDA18
replenishment discussions.

Scope and Key Questions

5.       As part of the analysis of issues concerning IDA’s development impact, the synthesis will
address the special themes for the most recent IDA replenishments (IDA 16 and 17), look at
relevant measurements for recent country level performance, and identify drivers of IDA results.
It will to this end draw on findings from relevant recent and ongoing evaluations in IEG’s work
program, for the latter to the extent that their results will in time become available, shared with
the Bank Group Management and presented to CODE. To the extent that evaluative evidence
allows, the synthesis product will cover World Bank Group activities in IDA countries, including
cooperation between the three institutions of World Bank, IFC and MIGA.

6.      The overarching theme for IDA17 is “Maximizing Development Impact” and for IDA16
the closely related “Delivering Development Results.” Within these overall headings there was
high continuity of special themes between IDA16 and IDA17, which indicates that these areas
also will be important for IDA going forward. Three of the four themes were unchanged
(although with some differences in formulations): Gender Equality, Climate Change, and Fragile
and Conflict-Affected States. In addition under IDA16 a special theme was Crisis Response, and
under IDA17 Inclusive Growth. The product will seek to address all five of these special
themes. 3




3For crisis response this will be based on three already completed evaluations (two on response to the financial crisis and one
on food crisis).

                                                                2
7.      The IDA17 replenishment document also focused on leveraging private resources,
leveraging public resources, leveraging knowledge, and IDA’s focus on results, efficiency, and
effectiveness. Where relevant and possible, the product will also touch on some of these aspects.

8.     The product will assemble evaluation findings from recently completed evaluations,
relevant follow-up information from the Management Action Record and evaluations expected to
be completed in FY15 and early FY16 relevant to the IDA special themes. Specifically, the
synthesis will bring together findings from thematic, country program, and project performance
evaluations to identify – as possible based on the available evaluative evidence – aspects that
have worked well or not worked so well and why, interconnections between themes, instruments
and approaches, and relations between Bank programs, country counterparts, and development
partners. It will broadly seek to answer the following questions under each theme:

       How has IDA addressed these themes in IDA countries through its country programs and
        individual operations?
       What factors have affected IDA development results at country level in general and
        pertaining to inclusive growth, climate change, and gender equality in particular?
       How effectively has IDA followed up on its commitments to strengthen its engagement
        in fragile and conflict affected states?
       What cross-cutting lessons emerge from IEG evaluations to help IDA maximize
        development impact?

9.       IDA Portfolio. IEG annually updates every year the aggregate numbers for the
performance of the Bank’s portfolio of completed projects and country programs. There was a
deterioration in the portfolio performance in IDA countries in FY11-13 compare to FY08-10.
These findings regarding the performance of country programs and projects for IDA countries
will be updated to the end of FY15, with selective analytical cuts to elaborate on some of the
performance and portfolio trends. The team will also consider whether the available evaluative
evidence would permit any discussion on regional IDA programs. On the assumptions that the
IDA deputies will receive a comprehensive and detailed portfolio and performance analysis of
IDA countries from IDA team in operations, IEG will not go into as much depth in this section.
It will confine itself to an update on the aggregate numbers that IEG normally reports in the
RAP, using IEG validated data with some selected regional or sectoral disaggregation where
appropriate and useful).

10.     Previous IEG Evaluations of IDA. IEG has previously undertaken two major evaluations
that were requested from the IDA Deputies: Evaluation of IDA10, 11 and 12 (completed around
2002), and the evaluation of IDA’s internal controls (completed around 2009, with a subsequent
evaluation around 2010 of management’s remediation program), both of which were funded through
special additional, non-fungible budget allocations. The synthesis product will remind readers of these


                                                   3
two exercises and their major findings, also to provide some “historical” perspective to IEG’s
engagement with IDA issues.

Evaluative Sources4

11.    Country Programs: IDA programs are implemented using a country-based
development model, and the synthesis product will review the performance and draw lessons
from evaluations and validations of country programs in IDA countries. Also, IDA17 documents
expected that in designing Country Partnership Frameworks for IDA countries, attention would
be given to the overarching and special themes. For that reason, the product will address the
evolving country partnership frameworks and in particular their inclusion of the special themes,
and will draw lessons from IEG’s country program evaluations relevant to IDA agenda.

12.    IEG has produced eight country program evaluations for IDA countries since FY08, and
another three have been completed as part of clustered evaluations. The FY15 Clustered Country
Program Evaluation on Resource-Rich Countries (11) is assessing WBG support for helping
countries manage the fiscal challenges of natural resource rents while ensuring broad-based
sharing of benefits. The product will review these country program evaluations as well as the
IEG validations of country strategies through FY15 and early FY16 with a view to identify
supplementary findings and trends. The focus of this discussion is likely to be more on what
works and why, and less on numerical portfolio trends.

13.     Inclusive Growth. Several recently completed and ongoing FY15 evaluations focus on
certain aspects of inclusive growth and will be analyzed to see how poverty focused IDA country
programs have been, how specifically how specifically IDA country programs aimed to reach the
poor and how effectively they have done so, including what role Bank interventions to enhance
access to finance and youth employment have been and what factors explain success and
failures. Specifically the product will draw on the following thematic evaluations

         FY13 Youth Employment took stock of international experience and evaluated the relevance
          and effectiveness of WBG support for youth employment, including in IDA countries.

  Attachment 2 lists the available and planned evaluative sources for this product. They cover a wide range of topics, but some
unevenness of treatment may inevitably occur depending on the amount of relevant material that will be available for different
topics and themes. The IEG sources will provide the bulk of the material for the product, but some other materials, such as
management learning reviews, may be also consulted selectively. The numbers shown for convenience in parentheses above
for each evaluation refer to the numbered evaluations in Attachment 2. Attachment 3 shows available country program
evaluations (CPEs) and Attachment 4a completed and planned project performance assessment reports (PPARs) – these are
summarized in Attachment 4b. This is a synthesis of evaluation findings regarding issues and development effectiveness
(pertaining to IDA’s issues of focus), which normally do not change quickly over time, and not an evaluation of IDA results over
any specific period. For that reason the synthesis will be somewhat flexible how far back it finds it appropriate to go, based on
the likely continued relevance going forward of the evaluation findings.

                                                                4
       FY14 Targeted Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (2) looked at how effectively
        WBG support to SMEs has been integrated into the larger thinking on inclusive growth
        and job creation.

       FY15 Getting to Poverty (10) aims to understand how the Bank designs and implements
        country programs to contribute to poverty reduction, with a focus on the adequacy of data
        and diagnostics, integration of analytical work into country strategies and selection of
        interventions, and effectiveness of feedback loops.
       FY15 Inclusive Finance (7) assesses the effectiveness of WBG support to promote
        financial inclusion, which is a critical pillar of the inclusive growth theme in IDA17.

14.     Gender Equality. Several recent, ongoing and forthcoming IEG evaluations focus inter
alia on gender equality and will be drawn on to assess how effectively IDA has addressed gender
equality in its programs and operations and what lessons emerge to ensure IDA can effectively
support gender equality going forward. Specifically, the product will draw on the following
evaluations: FY14 Gender in Sectors: Social Safety Nets and Gender Equality (6); WBG Support
to FCS Evaluation (1); Investment Climate Reform (5); FY15 Electricity Access (16);
Inclusive Finance (7); and Early Childhood Development (12). The team will explore to what
extent early findings from the gender equality chapter of the Results and Performance (RAP)
2015 can be integrated (the one-stop review of the report is scheduled for October 2015).

15.     Climate change. IEG has completed three major evaluations over the past five years on
climate change5 which the IDA synthesis will draw on to the extent that findings remain relevant.
Many of the major sectoral and country evaluations in the IEG program have strong coverage of
climate change-related issues. For example, Electricity Access (16) has looked at the uptake of
renewable energy in rural (off-grid) areas. IEG also chaired recently an Evaluation Oversight
Committee for a special evaluation of the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) for the CIF governing
bodies, Independent Evaluation of the Climate Investment Funds, June 2014. Findings from
these evaluations will be combined with a review of relevant PPARs (Project Performance
Assessment Reports) and Country Program Evaluations to see how effectively IDA helps its
client countries prepare for, and tackle climate change risks, and what lessons emerge to help
IDA assist the poorest and most vulnerable countries with climate change adaptation and
mitigation going forward.

16.     Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCSs). IEG shared the early findings from its
FY14 WBG Support to FCS Evaluation (1) with the IDA Deputies during the IDA17
replenishment process. The implementation of WBG management’s response to the


5
 FY13 Adapting to Climate Change: Assessing World Bank Experience; FY10 The Challenge of Low-Carbon Development:
Climate Change and the World Bank Group; and FY09 Climate Change and World Bank Group: Win-Win Energy Policy
Reforms.

                                                         5
recommendations of the IEG evaluation is one of the IDA17 policy commitments. The synthesis
products will summarize the key findings of FCS evaluation and will follow up the
implementation progress of its recommendations, drawing on MAR reports.

17.     Project Level Evaluations. The Product will update from RAP2013 and RAP2014 (8)
summarized findings from project level evaluations for IDA countries, most importantly levels
and trends for project ratings, and also including applicable lessons from relevant Project
Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs), as well as the findings of FY14-15 Learning and
Results in WBG Operations (13). This will provide an overview of what has worked and what
has not worked and why. Attachment 4(a) lists relevant recent and ongoing/planned PPARs.

Audience

18.     The main audience for this synthesis product will be World Bank Board members (and
specifically CODE) and IDA Deputies. Bank senior management, which is implementing the
IDA program, and client country stakeholders, who would stand to benefit from the appropriate
implementation of the limited IDA resources. Generally, the synthesis should also be useful for
individual program task teams and task team leaders engaged in the identification, preparation,
or supervision of IDA operations.

Quality Assurance and Team

19.     The evaluation will be overseen by Nick York, Director, IEGCC and Geeta Batra,
Manager, IEGCC. Peer reviewers are Johannes Linn (former Vice President for ECA Region)
and Henock Kifle (former Chief Economist for African Development Bank and Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ethiopia). The synthesis product will be written by
a small team led by Ismail Arslan, including Monika Huppi, Nils Fostvedt , Xue Li and Kendra
Diane White (focus on economic and portfolio analysis). The team would be supplemented by
additional IEG staff and consultants as needed.

Timeline

20.      This product is expected to be produced based on existing evaluative evidence and other
relevant material available, with no mission travel. The synthesis report had originally been timed
for delivery in FY17, but has been brought forward to FY16 to ensure that it will be timely for the
IDA18 discussions. To ensure that the report is useful to the Board, IDA Deputies, and World Bank
Management, , it will be finalized by February 2016, in line with the timing of the planned first
replenishment meeting for IDA18 in March 2016. The timing of this delivery is of essence and will be
maintained even if some of the planned evaluation inputs (discussed earlier in this note) should be
delayed. Even so, it is of vital importance for this tight deadline that the team for this report will have
free and early access to the relevant evaluative material as this would become available, including
drafts of background papers and country case study reports.

                                                     6
21.     As a synthesis of other evaluative material it is expected that the product will provide findings
and lessons but will not include recommendations.

22.     The report will be finalized and shared with the Board through CODE in March 2016, in
line with making the report available to IDA Deputies in time for their first replenishment meeting for
IDA18 in March 2016.
