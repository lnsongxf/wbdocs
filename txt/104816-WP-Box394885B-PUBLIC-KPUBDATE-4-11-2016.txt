             Focusing on Sustainable Forestry and
             Forest-Smart Interventions
             Introduction
             Through the Forest Action Plan FY16-20, the World Bank Group aims to boost the potential of forests
             to lift people out of poverty and generate lasting social, economic, and environmental returns in our
             client countries. It supports countries to define development pathways that take the importance of
             ­
             their forest capital into account.
                 It builds on and strengthens the World Bank Group’s 2002 Forest Strategy (Sustaining Forests:
             A Development Strategy) and identifies two focus areas for our engagement for the next five years:
             sustainable forest management and forest-smart interventions in other sectors. These two focus
             areas are supported by three themes that aim to strengthen the foundations for positive forest out-
             comes: climate change and resilience, rights and participation, and institutions and governance.
