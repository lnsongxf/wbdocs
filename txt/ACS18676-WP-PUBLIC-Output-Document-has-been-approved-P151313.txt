                                          Summary of Outputs


    1. Background and Objectives

The Parliamentary Strengthening in Tunisia and Morocco project was approved in May 2014 in response
to a request from the Parliaments of Tunisia and Morocco for World Bank support to administrative staff
and parliamentarians in the area of budget oversight and public engagement. This request arose in the
context of transition in both countries, where the oversight role of Parliament has been recently
reinforced.

In Morocco, the 2011 Constitution clearly stipulates the power of the Parliament in overseeing the
government and provides it with the tools and mechanisms needed to adhere to this role. The Parliament
has become the sole source of legislation, and its scope of competence expanded to include extensive
powers regarding the passing of a large number of organic laws needed to implement the new
Constitution. In some cases, (at the King’s discretion) Parliament is entitled to amend the Constitution
with no need for a referendum. Moreover, the role of the opposition as a full-fledged authority has been
enhanced and new means of action have been placed at its disposal, allowing for stronger, more
responsible involvement in the work of Parliament. Through constitutional reform, Parliament’s role to
oversee the work of the government has been strengthened, thus enabling its role in the evaluation of
public policies which also opens up promising prospects for Parliament to introduce appropriate, timely
amendments to programs to make sure they are properly managed and are in turn, successful. The role of
Parliament in the budget process has also been strengthened across the drafting, adoption, and oversight
phases of the budget cycle.

Since 2011, Tunisia has witnessed a transitional period characterized by notable progress in the area of
accountability and good governance. Since 2014, the transition in Tunisia made steady progress with the
adoption of the new Constitution and the successful completion of both parliamentary and presidential
elections. This achievement marked Tunisia’s first electoral transfer of power since t he 2011 Jasmine
Revolution and gave the country its first democratically elected parliament and president. Emblematic
post-revolution reforms to strengthen governance and social accountability in the country were
implemented including, among others, the revision of the law on Freedom of Association and the legal
framework to allow public access to information, especially information on budgets and the government
financial activities, and allowing the Court of Accounts audit reports to be published. An integral element
of the new Constitution in Tunisia is also the central role of parliament in strengthening voice and
participation. Nonetheless, strengthening the capacity of the legislature to adhere to its role and
responsibility efficiently and effectively remains a major concern in Tunisia, particularly in light of the
direct impact these institutions have on the success of the ongoing reform process in the country.

This project was designed to reinforce new opportunities that have arisen in the context of the Arab
Spring and which continue to arise in the midst of evolving governance frameworks in these countries
particularly in the area of openness and transparency. Targeted support was requested for members of the
Finance and Economic Development Committee; (ii) the Public Accounts Committee; (iii) and line
committees directly involved in financial oversight functions. The project was executed by the Bank, on
behalf of the Parliaments of Morocco and Tunisia.

Specifically, the Project Development Objective of the technical assistance is: to support parliamentary
oversight functions in Tunisia and Morocco in line with new Constitutional reforms. This was to be
achieved in Tunisia, by supporting the National Constituent Assembly and its successor parliamentary

                                                                                                         3
administration (now the Tunisian Assembly of the Representatives of the People) in developing and
implementing proper citizen engagement, transparency and budget oversight processes to help secure the
successful implementation of the new constitution and a more open and engaged legislature. In Morocco,
the project supported capacity building activities for parliamentary staff in line with the new roles and
responsibilities attributed to Parliament in the area of access to information and budget oversight, public
petitions, and public consultations.

A participation training questionnaire was developed to assess direct feedback from parliamentary staff
and MPs on quality of trainings and technical assistance provided and impact of project support. This
questionnaire allows the team to receive feedback on ongoing technical assistance and readjust
throughout the implementation phase to meet the demands and needs of the participants. To date, 64% of
participants attest to the pertinence and relevance of the training programs and 79% believe the project
has successfully achieved its stated objective.

In order to achieve its objectives, a number of activities were undertaken. These activities can be
categorized along the following areas: (i) technical assistance; (ii) capacity building and training; and (iii)
knowledge exchange activities. Details on the outputs delivered as part of this task is described further
below:


    2. Components and Related Outputs

Despite a challenging context characterized by political instability and regional turmoil, progress has been
made in a number of areas linked to parliamentary oversight. The range of activities supported by this
program were designed as a holistic approach to governance reform in both countries particularly in
extending World Bank support to key oversight institutions such as Parliament. Support and technical
assistance focused specifically on areas where much traction is needed to ensure proper inclusive
institutions capable of responding to the demands stemming from the ongoing transitions in both
countries. The TA can be divided across two main components.

Component I. Public engagement:

This component focused on activities strengthening the capacity of parliamentarians and staff to adhere to
public engagement mechanisms in parliamentary work. The targeted nature of the technical assistance
was designed to address priority and time-sensitive reform efforts linked to the public engagement
domain. As a result of constitutional reforms in Morocco and open government commitments in Tunisia,
the reform on public petitions was a key area of focus under this component.

The core outputs of this Component included:

    -   Two capacity reviews of the existing evidence on petitions processes and broader public
        engagement capacity functions in both institutional structures of the Morocco and Tunisia
        parliaments. The main outputs are entitled, “Capacity Review of the Moroccan House of
        Representatives” and “Capacity Review of the Tunisian Assembly of the Representatives of the
        People”. The capacity reviews provided an overview of de jure and de facto aspects. The
        assessment is a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the main capacity constraints facing
        Parliament in the midst of ongoing change.
    -   A Terms of Reference for recruiting relevant experts to advise on the policy angle
    -   International Benchmarking Study on parliamentary petitions processes entitled, “Petit guide des
        pétitions parlementaires”
    -   Policy note on Morocco Parliament’s Internal Bylaws regarding petitions

                                                                                                             4

Component II. Budget oversight

This component focused on strengthening the capacity of parliamentarians and staff for budget analysis to
improve oversight responsibilities, introduced by the constitutional and budget reforms in these countries.
Training was developed and implemented to: (i) strengthen the ability of parliamentarians to engage in
the formulation of the national budget and (ii) to oversee the implementation of projects funded under the
national budget. In Morocco, specific focus was placed on performance based budgeting as a result of the
organic budget law newly introduced, including greater government accountability and performance focus
in the management of public resources through advice, technical assistance and training. In Tunisia, focus
was placed primarily on supporting core budget oversight functions including training on access to budget
data and budget analysis. Both of these target areas were based on the demand of each respective
parliament and internal capacity needs.

The core outputs of this Component included:

    -   Two capacity reviews of the existing evidence on budget oversight functions in both institutional
        structures of the Morocco and Tunisia parliaments. The main outputs are entitled, “Capacity
        Review of the Moroccan House of Representatives” and “Capacity Review of the Tunisian
        Assembly of the Representatives of the People”. The capacity reviews provided an overview of
        de jure and de facto aspects. The assessment is a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis of
        the main capacity constraints facing Parliament in the midst of ongoing change. The review has
        helped set the stage for the design and implementation of subsequent trainings in a range of topics
        related to budget oversight.
    -   A Terms of Reference for recruiting relevant experts to advise on/undertake the trainings
    -   A series of presentations (PPTs) presented at different stages of the training modules in each
        respective country context on (i) access to budget data; (ii) macro-fiscal forecasting; and (iii)
        performance based budgeting (in French/Arabic)
    -   A series of notes at different stages of the training process to capture initial findings and learnings
        (in French)
    -   Over 17 training sessions in Morocco and Tunisia conducted by international experts on (i) access
        to budget data and Boost; (ii) performance based budgeting; (iii) macro-fiscal forecasting; and
        (iv) report drafting. On macro fiscal forecasting, expertise was mobilized from the Lebanese
        Economic Association to provide technical assistance to the Parliament on issues such as budget
        preparation contextualized for Morocco, the evaluation of expenditure policy and forecasting, tax
        policy, and the development of a macro-economic model for Morocco. The training was designed
        as a hands-on and concrete support. On performance based budgeting in Morocco, this training
        was designed in close collaboration with the Bank’s parallel engagement with the Ministr y of
        Finance supported through a twinning arrangement with the French administration on program
        budgeting and ministerial performance plans. The timetable for the trainings was developed with
        the aim of accompanying the budget reform and building capacity among staff and MPs to better
        understand the performance approach newly introduced by the organic budget law.

    3. Next Steps

Designed as a flexible and targeted approach to support the priority needs of Parliament in the context of
ongoing transition, the technical assistance primarily targeted administrative staff and parliamentarians to

                                                                                                             5
build institutional capacity in both countries and help strengthen the foundation for knowledge-transfer
across the institution. This comprehensive approach (both institutional and individual) was aimed to build
coalitions for reform within the institution as well as ensure that the capacity building impact of this
project feeds into the ongoing reform processes on the ground. This complementary approach also helped
to reinforce broader World Bank governance support in both countries on the development of a legal
framework on public engagement and strengthening oversight mechanisms, in addition to extending
World Bank support to the legislative branch on key reforms linked to the organic budget law such as the
new performance based budgeting approach. In moving forward, the initial engagement provided by the
MENA MDTF has led to subsequent requests for technical assistance in both countries. Follow up
support has been identified and developed in line with the request of each parliamentary institution.

In Morocco, the technical assistance support funded by the MENA Transition Fund will cover a period of
three years and provide the House of Representatives with support to the institutionalization of key
transformative reforms implicating Parliament directly, such as performance based budgeting which will
enhance the government’s accountability towards parliament and tax payers, and public petitions reform
which will enhance the inclusive nature of public policy making. The program will also provide capacity
building to increase effective parliamentary oversight, particularly in these areas, as well as the
development of a standardized training program on key functions such as budget analysis and access to
budget data. The program will be Bank-executed. A programmatic approach will also provide for a
flexible work program that aims to respond to the complexity of the ongoing reforms and the nature of the
challenges and counterpart needs. Activities will be directed towards supporting policy dialogue in
Parliament’s reform agenda through a combination of: (1) policy notes; (2) the provision of technical
assistance, and; (3) capacity building and training programs, including through videoconference and
distance learning as necessary to sustain momentum of learning activities. The successful implementation
of these ambitious reforms both through enhancing parliamentary capacity to engage throughout the
legislative cycle as well as in supporting the development of institutional parliamentary mechanisms to
support reforms, will aim to transform the Moroccan governance frameworks into one focused on citizen
satisfaction, performance, and results.

In Tunisia, technical assistance will support the Parliament and the Court of Audit. This
engagement will build on the initial support provided under the initial MDTF technical
assistance on budget oversight and public engagement. The project will be implemented through
three main components: (1) strengthening capacity among MPs and staff in budget oversight, legislative
affairs and public engagement; (2) strengthening capacity of CoA in engaging with citizens, parliament,
and non-traditional stakeholders and 3) Regional Knowledge and Learning. All components of the
project are mutually reinforcing and help to support overall parliamentary oversight and external
audit capacity. Cross-cutting themes, such as enhancing parliaments engagement during the
budget process and support on public engagement reforms helps to ensure programming across
themes is aligned, and lessons learnt during the implementation of one component benefits the
other component of the project. Furthermore, the Morocco Transition Fund program will provide the
Bank with an effective means to help maximize existing synergies between ongoing reforms in the region
such as Tunisia, particularly in light of their complementary nature.
