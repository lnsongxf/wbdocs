HOW IFC BUILDS PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS
Our role is not just to invest, but to build this high-impact industry in four key ways:




  1	     Setting Standards
         •	 Showing that sustainability is good business
         •	 Holding client fund managers to high environmental,
            social, and governance standards



  2	     Mobilizing Capital
         •	 Being a first mover
         •	 Adding a trusted stamp of approval that attracts others



  3	     Pushing the Envelope
         •	 Testing the frontiers with funds for new countries and sectors
         •	 Supporting first-time fund managers with strong local presence



  4	     Creating Knowledge
         •	 Monitoring results and impacts
         •	 Sharing lessons learned




                                                                                           5

Private Equity and Climate Change
Crisis and Response




Climate change is the biggest challenge to development
today. It is one that requires both government leader-
ship and large-scale private sector action—and is a core
strategic priority for IFC. In fiscal year 2012 alone, we in-
vested more than $1.6 billion in climate-related projects.
    Bringing the capital, expertise, and innovation
needed to help foster low-emission growth, private
equity funds are a key component of IFC’s overall
response to climate change within the World Bank
Group. We have committed about $340 million in 17
climate-focused funds. In December 2012, IFC invested
$75 million in IFC Catalyst Fund, a fund of funds
which will allow investors to participate in IFC’s con-
tinuing investment program in private equity funds fo-
cused on providing growth capital for companies that
enable resource efficiency and develop low-emissions
products and services in emerging markets.
    Our portfolio includes the ZAR750 million ($90
million) Evolution One Fund that is leading the
way for cleantech and renewable energy investments
in Southern Africa. It is financing some of South
Africa’s first grid-connected solar photovoltaic and
onshore wind independent power projects and other
innovative companies in the waste management
and agribusiness sectors. The fund has so far lev-

Job Creation
Fast-growing companies create jobs.

Private equity helps them do so—faster, in many cases,
than other unlisted firms that lack this kind of support.

SMEs: Anchors of Employment
Creating jobs—where the Arab Spring began



A frustrated Tunisian fruit-seller’s self-immolation in
December 2010 sparked a wave of outrage across the
Middle East and North Africa, driven in large part by
widespread joblessness. At the core sat a paradox: the
region’s labor force is one of the fastest-growing in
the world, needing to create up to 75 million new jobs
in the next decade just to keep up with population
growth and bring down unemployment. Yet its key
sources of jobs—micro, small, and medium enter-
prises—show the world’s lowest access to finance.
     It is a fundamental issue that must be addressed.
     In large part, this means helping the region’s prom-
ising smaller companies reach their full potential.
Tunisia’s Altea Packaging, for example, now has 680
direct employees, more than seven times as many as
it did the day we first met it. And it is preserving those
jobs today, despite its region’s economic downturn.
This is not counting the important positive impact

Creating Corporate Governance
Since 2007, over 50 percent of the funds supported by IFC have
been in the world’s poorest countries.
The Leopard Haiti Fund is one of them—making the business case
for transparency.




The road to recovery is long and hard in Haiti, requiring
private sector solutions to create jobs and reduce poverty.
     Local entrepreneurs are essential players in moving
the country forward from the devastation of the 2010
earthquake, but are typically starved for capital and
knowledge. To fill the void, IFC has helped launch the
country’s first institutional-quality private equity vehicle,
blending investment with advice for maximum impact.
     Launched in 2012, the $20 million Leopard Haiti
Fund is a catalyst for change—run by respected inter-

corporate governance and are committed to building it

Growth Equity
Madagascar is one of Africa’s poorest, most difficult markets—
overlooked by most fund managers, especially amid the ongoing
political strife that has dampened the economy since 2009.
I&P’s investment in Newpack tells a different story.




Frontier market conditions are extremely challenging.
But they are also ones in which specialized private
equity house I&P Management thrives. Working from
four offices (Mauritius, Madagascar, Ghana, and Côte
d’Ivoire) the group is both earning good returns for its
investors and strengthening the economy by building
up local SMEs. One of them is Madagascar’s Newpack,
a fast-growing manufacturer of cardboard packaging.
    In 2008, I&P acquired Newpack from its founder,
who had developed the firm into the local market
leader but was ready to retire after 20 years.
    Seeing bright opportunities ahead, the new owners
quickly took a hands-on stance, bringing in new
management and spearheading changes in strategy.
Considerable focus went to greening the ISO 9001–

Small Business Funds
Tapping the entrepreneurial energy of fragile and conflict-affected states



Entrepreneurs face a special dilemma in the poorest,
most conflict-affected countries—where microfinance
abounds, but private equity is all but unknown.
     They drive job creation and economic growth, but are
stuck in the middle: too big for microfinance, too small
for commercial banks, and having few ways to build the
management skills or industry knowledge they need to grow.
     Responding to this dilemma, IFC has created the
West Africa Ventures Fund, a specialized vehicle for
small businesses in war-torn Sierra Leone and Liberia
with $40 million in investment capital and $2.2 million
in grant-funded advisory services to offer. Managed by
Nigeria’s Unique Venture Capital, it is one of five such
funds in our SME Ventures program.
     The fund’s goal is to provide a full integrated package
of investment and advice. All investees are currently
upgrading their skills through Business Edge, IFC’s afford-

commercially in 38 countries. In the future, the advisory      Above Herbal tea producer Morvigor (top left) and bottled water
