CONTEXT

i.      Rwanda has made impressive performance in the last decade, particularly in the last five
years, in promoting significant economic reforms, rapid growth, and poverty reduction. The
agriculture sector’s dominant structure and excellent performance have played a major role in making
positive contributions. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain to be addressed.

ii.     Vision 2020 (2004-2020) and the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS 2) (2013-2018) outline a sound country-level framework within which the Third
Phase of the Strategic Program for the Transformation of Agriculture in Rwanda (PSTA 3) (2013/14-
2017/18) was framed to address the unfinished agenda from a successful PSTA 2 (with over 90 percent
completion of key objectives and targets) and to further propel the transformation of the agriculture sector
from subsistence to market-oriented production. PSTA 3 is guided by and operationalizes for Rwanda the
overall Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). PSTA 3, its Results
Framework (RF), and the resulting Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (ASIP) were also guided by the
Economic and Sector Work (ESW)1 carried out by the World Bank and other key Development Partners
(DPs), in close collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). There is a
strong strategic and operational rationale for the Bank’s support of the proposed PSTA 3 and its ASIP.

PSTA 3 AND THE PROGRAM’S MAIN FEATURES

iii.    The PSTA 3 program’s strategic objectives are to: i) intensify, commercialize, and transform
the Rwandan agriculture sector to enhance food security and nutrition, reduce poverty, and drive
economic growth; and ii) accelerate sustainable increases and expanded private sector role in production,
processing, and value–addition and commercialization of staple crops, export commodities, and livestock
products. PSTA 3 has eight major impact-level targets that are ambitious but achievable, building on the
excellent performance under PSTA 2. The focus of PSTA 3 is on intensifying core “drivers” of sectoral
growth, transformation, and poverty reduction.

iv.      PSTA 3 Programs and Supportive RF. Building on the above policy-driven impact targets and
goals and the identified agricultural “transformation drivers,” PSTA 3 comprises four program areas and
24 component subprograms (SPs). The four programs are: i) Agriculture and animal resource
intensification; ii) Research, technology transfer and organization of farmers, iii) Private sector-driven
value chain development and expanded investments; and iv) Institutional results-focused development
and agricultural crosscutting issues. A comprehensive RF, supported by a well-thought-out results chain,
underpins PSTA 3’s design and credibility. There are also efforts to complete the update of a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that will be used as a management tool to
achieve the objectives and targets and to help guide needed adjustments.

v.      Estimated Costs and Expenditure Framework. Building on PSTA 3’s RF, the estimated total
cost for ASIP is about US$1.2 billion, with an additional indicative investment level of about US$550
million from the private sector. This level of public expenditures is ASIP’s “medium-cost” scenario; it
was endorsed by the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and DPs as constituting a credible financing level and
plan in a recent high-level CAADP 2 meeting (June 2014). This level of funding is also consistent with:
the increasing trend in public agricultural expenditures; the government’s strong commitment to the

agriculture sector and to providing enhanced policies and increased public funding in recognition of the
sector’s vital role in helping to meet country-level goals/targets and the technical soundness of the ASIP;
and intentions for substantial increases in DP funding for the sector. Therefore, the expenditure and
financing framework and supporting management processes (being improved) are sound, contributing to
enhanced expenditure efficiencies and effectiveness.

vi.      Objectives and Key Features of the Program (PforR). The proposed objective of the Ag.
PforR operation (= the “Program”) is to support the efficient and effective implementation of the GoR’s
strategic objectives of PSTA 3, equivalent to the “medium-cost” expenditure scenario of ASIP. The
Program is to be co-financed by the proposed IDA operation (US$100 million) and other DPs (including
EU, USAID, IFAD, and DFID), which together will support the entire national PSTA 3 program. The
additional co-financing will come within the first year of the PforR operation. The Ag. PforR operation
funds will disburse against the proposed disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), which are based on
several explicit strategic criteria. There are four results areas (or PSTA 3 programs) and corresponding
monitorable DLIs involving strategic outputs and outcomes (that also constitute “drivers” for other
results). The triggering of disbursements is based on a robust verification protocol of the agreed results
(DLIs), to be conducted by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

vii.     Assessment Results, Emerging Implications and Supportive Program Action Plan (PAP).
The Bank’s assessment mission and subsequent work provided a comprehensive review of PSTA
3/RF/ASIP. The review concluded that the PSTA 3 program is sound from a technical (including
economic and risk assessments), integrated fiduciary, social and environmental systems, and risk
perspectives. These four assessments identified specific areas of risk and capacity “gaps” and
recommended priority actions to enhance the implementation success of the Program. These actions
constitute the core of the PAP, which comprises four strategic cross-cutting areas and their risk mitigation
actions.

viii.    Economic Assessment. The Bank conducted a quantitative and qualitative assessment of PSTA
3’s ASIP proposal. The analyses showed favorable results, confirming the strong economic soundness
and justification of the proposed Program, and highlighting key underlying risks and success factors, also
addressed in the PAP. In summary:
     A 25-year cash flow model is used to assess the ex-ante productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of
      public sector investments;
     A selection of key drivers of agricultural growth is quantified in the model to analyze the impact of
      changes in public sector investment costs by linking enterprise models and SP costs. The medium-
      cost scenario yields an economic net present value of US$585 million and a sound economic rate of
      return of 21 percent. The results are consistent with PSTA’s target agricultural growth rate of 8.5
      percent p.a.;
     Meaningful poverty reduction is achieved through increased farm income and employment;
     Estimated elasticities indicate the relative impact of different SPs, therefore confirming the
      soundness of the Program’s expenditure balance and composition;
     Linkages between enterprise models and SPs highlight positive synergies;
     Agriculture growth is driven by the nine quantified SPs, with linkages to the other SPs;
     Effective institutions, adapted and implemented legal and regulatory frameworks, and effective
      targeting of disadvantaged beneficiary groups strengthen inclusive program impact;
     Tracking impacts against a baseline with reliable M&E systems (aligned to the RF) helps decision
      makers and DPs make better evidence-based investment decisions.

ix.     Overall Risk Rating and PAP. The detailed technical assessment concludes an overall risk
rating of “Moderate,” considering the ambitious but achievable goals and targets to promote significant
transformation in the sector and in the livelihoods of the rural population. Further details on the main risk

                                                     v
areas are presented in an Integrated Risk Assessment. The proposed PAP was designed to address the
identified strategic cross-cutting risks, as well as other identified risk mitigating actions for each of the 24
SPs; their risk ratings range from “Low” to “High,” with most of the SPs having a “Moderate” risk.

PART A: Program Description

i.       Description of the government program
1.      Rwanda has made impressive performance in the last decade, particularly in the last five
years, in promoting significant economic reforms and rapid growth and poverty reduction (e.g., an
economic growth rate of 8 percent from 1999-2012 and a reduction in poverty from 59 percent to 45
percent of the population below the poverty line from 2001 to 2012). The agriculture sector’s dominant
structure and excellent performance have played a major role in making positive contributions. Based on
evidenced-based analyses, 2 from 2001-2013 Rwanda’s agriculture sector contributed 20.5 percentage
points to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth (and contributed 33 percent of total GDP in
2013), grew at an average 5.6 percent p.a., and contributed a minimum of 45 percent of the poverty
reduction in the country. Propelled by the first two phases of the Strategic Program for the
Transformation of Agriculture in Rwanda (PSTA 1 and 2, 2003-2007, 2008-2012), the high-level drivers
of agricultural growth and reduced poverty over the last 10 years were: increased productivity and
production of food and export crops, marketing of production, and increased off-farm employment
through food and export crop commodity value chain development.3

2.       Nonetheless, significant challenges remain to be addressed, including: i) sustaining in the
medium to long term the productivity gains that have contributed to strong agriculture growth and raised
rural incomes; ii) increasing nutrition security for the rural population; iii) strengthening and deepening
market-driven value chain development, including increasing agroprocessing, which has created nonfarm
employment; iv) securing and strengthening linkages to domestic and regional/international markets for
agriculture production surpluses; v) enhancing the enabling environment to attract private sector
investment and add value to the productivity and diversification increases; and vi) strengthening systems
and capacities to ensure adequate and effective management and governance of the agriculture sector.

3.       Vision 2020 (2004-2020) and the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS 2) (2013-2018) outline a sound country-level framework within which the Third Phase
of the Strategic Program for the Transformation of Agriculture in Rwanda (PSTA 3) (2014-2018) was
framed to address the unfinished agenda of policy and institutional reforms, investments, and
transformation of the agriculture sector from subsistence to market-oriented production. PSTA 3’s
efficient and effective implementation is a high priority of the Government of Rwanda (GoR), under the
leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (MINAGRI). 4

   PSTA 3 is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI), in line with its current
organizational and functional structure and actors: four departments (Planning, Inspection, Crop Production, and Animal
Resources); two Task Forces (Irrigation and Post-Harvest Infrastructure); two semi-autonomous implementing agencies: Rwanda
Agriculture Board (RAB), and National Agriculture Export Board (NAEB); three Single Program Implementation Units (SPIUs)
which implement donor-supported projects (World Bank, IFAD, African Development Bank); and 30 Districts (as part of a
decentralizing Government structure). The central government, through MINAGRI, provides policy, coordination and financing
leadership for the PSTA 3 program, including strong harmonization and alignment of development assistance. Implementation
responsibilities rest with the Task Forces, RAB, NAEB, SPIUs, and Districts, which are enabled by various coordination
mechanisms. Implementation roles and approaches vary with a mix of national, District, community, and private program
delivery. Currently, MINAGRI is completing a restructuring exercise to further streamline and enhance organizational and
implementation efficiencies and effectiveness.

                                                            1
4.      PSTA 3 includes various instruments to support the effective operationalization, funding,
implementation, and M&E of the program: a comprehensive Results Framework (RF), underpinned by
a strong results chain; an Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (ASIP), with substantial increases in both
public and private sector investments over PSTA 2 (2008-2013), together with an expanded role of an
inclusive private sector; an updated, integrated and operational M&E framework and action plan to
support better and more timely decision making and enhanced implementation, as part of the medium-
term and annual budgetary planning and implementation processes; processes and mechanisms to
promote an inclusive, expanded private sector role in PSTA 3; and operational financing instruments to
support the adequate financing and effective implementation of the ASIP. Additionally, MINAGRI has
made concerted efforts to ensure the relevant lessons from PSTA 25 have been taken into account and
adapted to the requirements of PSTA 3 (see Annex 1 for accomplishments of and detailed lessons learned
in PSTA 2).

5.       Outcomes from the implementation of PSTA 2 were highly favorable, with over 90 percent
completion of key objectives and targets.6 The key impacts achieved were related to the contribution of
over 45 percent of the 12 percent reduction in country-level poverty. Key outcomes achieved were
improvements in sustainable land management leading to more efficient land use, increased and improved
input utilization, and significant productivity increases resulting from expanded irrigation and cultural
practices. Several drivers responsible for Rwanda’s agriculture growth in the last five years were: i) the
establishment of a good business-enabling environment and well-prioritized and directed public
investments; and ii) expansion of food production and scaled-up public investments in the Crop-
Intensification Program (CIP), Land Use Consolidation Program (LUCP), input subsidies on fertilizers
and seeds, and other public activities to promote production of priority crops.

6.      Rwanda’s PSTA 3 program is guided by and operationalizes for Rwanda the overall
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). 7 Rwanda was the first
country to sign a CAADP Compact and prepare an ASIP strategy (PSTA 2) that was fully aligned with
CAADP. Having fulfilled its first CAADP investment strategy (2008-2013), the country launched the
second Rwanda CAADP ASIP based on PSTA 3 in June 2014.8

7.       PSTA 3, its RF, and the ASIP were also guided by Economic and Sector Work (ESW) by
the World Bank and other key development partners (DPs). Some of the key recommendations
from the analyses were: agriculture will continue in the medium term to be the leading engine for
growth and poverty reduction in Rwanda; some agricultural subsectors will grow more rapidly than others
(e.g., export crops and livestock); the contribution of each subsector to GDP growth depends not only on
the rate of growth achieved in that subsector, but also on the absolute size of the subsector. Taking into
account the large absolute size of the food crops subsectors, most of the growth in agriculture should

  CAADP aims to help African countries reach a higher path of economic growth through agriculture-led development. CAADP's
vision is to addresses policy and capacity issues across the entire agriculture sector and African continent. CAADP is entirely
African-led and African-owned and represents African leaders' collective vision for agriculture in Africa.
8
  On June 9-10, 2014, a two-day meeting was held to mobilize national and international partners around the CAADP. Having
successfully implemented the first cycle of CAADP, MINAGRI is now embarking on the second cycle of CAADP to
operationalize the country's Second EDPRS (2013-17) and the third phase of the Strategic Plan for the Transformation of
Agriculture (2013-18). At the meeting, the achievements of Rwanda’s first CAADP and PSTA 2 were presented along with
PSTA 3’s strategy, program, RF, and the ASIP. Clear sector prioritization of investment needs, funding modalities,
harmonization of stakeholder activities for efficient delivery, and stronger accountability mechanisms were also presented. A
half-day session was dedicated to policies and priorities related to private sector development. At the meeting an MOU was
signed by the government, private sector, civil society, and DPs supporting the principles and objectives of PSTA 3/Rwanda
CAADP 2.

continue to come from growth in food crops, especially considering that increased incomes will expand
food demand. Export crops will make a significant contribution to growth, but the importance of this
contribution will be limited so long as the export crop subsector remains small relative to the food crops
and livestock sectors. PSTA 3 needs to: continue to include the development of a targeting strategy for
extreme poor rural farmers (focusing on increasing productivity and production of food crops consumed
by the poor); expand the CIP and LUCP; increase nonfarm employment and value addition of key and
competitive value chains; increase soil conservation coverage, especially in highly depleted soils, with
enhanced selectivity in hillside irrigation schemes; increase awareness and development of competitive
horticulture opportunities; expand livestock intensification and establish feeding limits for the One-Cow
(Girinka) Program; expand coffee and tea production, for which Rwanda demonstrates competitiveness;
and increase reliability and utilization of agriculture statistics and an enhanced M&E system.

8.       PSTA’s Results Framework. To operationalize PSTA 3, MINAGRI and its implementing
agencies (Rwanda Agricultural Board/RAB, National Agricultural Export Board/NAEB, and Special
Project Implementation Units/SPIUs) formulated a comprehensive RF (see Annex 2 for the high-level
version of PSTA 3’s RF; the detailed version is available on request). It is underpinned by an explicit
results chain and recent evidenced-based analysis (including empirical agricultural growth scenarios and
market and competitiveness analyses).9 Figure 1 illustrates the RF and underlying results chain to achieve
the key strategic targets, to be supported by the proposed disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).

9.       The PSTA 3 program’s strategic objectives are to transform Rwandan agriculture from a
subsistence-based to a knowledge-based sector and to accelerate agriculture growth to increase
rural incomes and reduce poverty. The strategy encompasses four broad program areas: i) agriculture
and animal resource intensification; ii) research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; iii)
value chain development and private sector investment; and iv) institutional development and agricultural
cross-cutting issues. These are designed to achieve the EDPRS 2 foundational goal of increased food and
nutrition security as measured by a target of 90 percent of households having acceptable food
consumption. PSTA 3 is supported by a gender strategy that requires addressing and mainstreaming

10 The main purpose of terracing is to reduce runoff and soil erosion on slopes and to improve soil quality and soil moisture
retention. It is a sustainable land use technology for small farmers with limited land holdings. Also, a major aim is to conserve
water and reduce runoff. Progressive terracing is carried out on slope gradients of 40-60% and radical terracing (bench like
terraces) is used on slope gradients of 16-40%.

  “Fully operational” includes preparation and dissemination of quarterly and annual progress reports on the key outputs, outco mes, and impacts of
the agriculture sector, in line with PSTA 3 (including periodic analytical and evidenced-based studies on strategic themes).


    11.      PSTA 3 has benefited from recent World Bank ESW on empirical agricultural growth
    scenarios and market and competitiveness analyses.17 The objective of the ESW was to review the
    performance and results of the First Rwanda CAADP and PSTA 2 as input into the preparation of the
    Second Rwanda CAADP and review of PSTA 3’s investment plan to assure the soundness of its
    assumptions and the efficiency with which Rwanda will achieve its goals going forward. The policy note
    recommended agricultural market opportunities at the national, regional, and global levels, analyzing the
    patterns of competitiveness and comparative advantage in Rwandan agriculture. While some of the crops
    identified for intensification in PSTA 3 by the GoR do not share equal competitive and comparative
    advantage, the GoR is pursuing pro-poor crops that can generate immediate income, raise families out of
    poverty, and build farmers’ assets, thereafter allowing them to diversify into more competitive crops.

    12.     Core Drivers: The focus of PSTA 3 is on intensifying the following six core “drivers” of
    sectoral growth, transformation, and poverty reduction:
       (i)  Increasing the productivity of crop, export, and livestock commodities, recognizing gender-
            differentiated approaches that would improve household food security and nutrition and rural
            incomes, especially of vulnerable rural families (through empowering farmers with land
            husbandry actions including land conservation – terracing, increasing soil fertility – organic and
            inorganic fertilization, increasing use of improved seeds and varieties, expanding land under
            irrigation, increasing coverage and quality of extension services, and increasing private sector-led
            mechanization);
      (ii)  Enhancing market-responsive technology introduction through research, technology transfer,
            strengthened research-extension linkages, and stronger and more effective farmers’ cooperatives
            and organizations, while addressing relevant sustainability and climate change challenges;
    (iii)   Significantly expanding and strengthening accessible and inclusive agricultural finance
            products and a sustainable agricultural finance policy framework and system (including savings
            mobilization and agricultural insurance) that would promote viable and inclusive investments,
            consistent with Rwanda's competitive advantage;
     (iv)   Stimulating expanded and inclusive private sector and market-driven value chain
            development and integration, facilitated by expanded models of effective public-private
            partnerships (PPPs);

                                                                         5
 (v)      Expanding market-oriented rural infrastructure (especially prioritized soil and conservation
          works, irrigation, rural feeder roads, and post-harvest facilities); and
(vi)      Strengthening institutional development and strategic cross-cutting themes, including:
           Promotion of effective multi-stakeholder formulation, consensus, and implementation of key
              policy reforms to enable key drivers of the sector transformation process, which in turn will
              empower farmers, consistent with Rwanda’s competitive advantage;
           Results-focused capacity development of key sector institutions and stakeholders at various
              levels (national and subnational);
           More efficient, responsive, transparent, and accountable decentralization of key agricultural
              services and their implementation;
           More effective and evidenced-based planning, budgetary, and M&E systems at various
              levels;
           Enhanced nutrition and food security;
           Attention to climate change challenges; and
           Strengthened processes and mechanisms for more effective coordination by MINAGRI
              (especially RAB and NAEB) with other relevant ministries/agencies, Districts (in support of
              ongoing decentralization), the private sector, and other key stakeholders.

13.      Building on the above impact targets, goals, RF, and “transformation drivers,” PSTA 3 is
comprises four program areas and 24 component subprograms (SPs). These are designed and driven
according to a results chain that links results at three levels – impacts, outcomes, and prioritized outputs18
– which are generated by prioritized lines of action/activities. These results are measured by “SMART”
(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) indicators and their corresponding ambitious
but achievable transformative targets of PSTA 3 (under the medium-cost scenario; see below).

14.    More specifically, the results chain is underpinned by the following explicit linkages and
supporting processes and mechanisms for achieving the specified and measureable strategic goals
and objectives:
     The four programs and their 24 component SPs, in terms of content, “balance,”
       complementarities, and synergies, aim to operationalize the above “drivers” of agricultural
       growth and transformation by creating a conducive policy and physical environment for enabling
       accelerated crop and livestock productivity and value addition, driven by an expanded and
       inclusive private sector role and investments, and facilitated through strengthened and
       decentralized institutions, and more food secure households;
     Each of the programs and their component SPs involve formulating/operationalizing key policies
       and mobilizing and enhancing capacities of strategic multi-stakeholder institutions and actors
       (both state and nonstate) to effectively formulate and implement appropriate: (a) policies; (b)
       institutional reforms/strengthening; and (c) prioritized public investments and expanded private
       sector investments;
     Within each SP, the RF outlines a roadmap for achieving the desired strategic objectives and
       targets, at outcome and output levels, supported by prioritized “lines of action,” to be carried out
       by specifying more sharply appropriate roles for the public and private sectors and PPPs;
     Each SP is designed to contribute to the strategic objectives and outcomes of each corresponding
       program; and

18
   Five prioritization criteria guided the “medium-cost” scenario in setting priorities and subsequent costing for the PSTA 3 ASIP
(2013/14 – 2017/18): i) Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to achieving Vision 2020 and EDPRS 2 strategic objectives and
targets (including poverty reduction); ii) Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to achieving increased crop and livestock
productivity and food security; iii) Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to inclusive agricultural private sector investment;
iv) Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to promote enhanced market focus commercialization and value addition; v) Degree
to which SPs/activities contribute to accelerate agricultural export growth. In addition, the prioritization endeavors to consider a
realistic level of financing availability and the implementation capacities of the relevant implementing actor(s).

                                                                 6
         Each program works in a complementary manner to contribute to the higher-level PSTA 3 goals
          and targets; these, in turn, contribute to the goals and targets of EDPRS 2, and are aligned to the
          continent-wide CAADP’s RF and targets.19

15.       PSTA 3’s Strategic Program Areas and Outcomes are:20

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification. i) Soil erosion reduced and land
sustainably managed; ii) Land productivity for priority crops increased; and iii) Animal productivity
increased and animal products diversified.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and organization of farmers. i) Improved technologies that
are responsive to Rwanda’s agro-ecological potential, men and women farmers’ needs and resources, and
market prospects; ii) Enhanced, integrated, and market-oriented research, extension, and advisory services
that result in a higher proportion of farmer adoption of improved technologies, for both men and women;
and iii) Strengthened inclusive and business-oriented farmers’ cooperatives/organizations with enhanced
entrepreneurial skills for effective engagement in input and output markets.

Program 3: Private sector-driven value chain development and expanded investments. i) Enhanced
business environment for expanded agricultural investments and value addition; and ii) Competitive and
private sector-driven value chain development and expanded commercialization of production for
domestic and export markets, enabled by expanded access to finance, an efficient and effective
agricultural marketing system, and improved rural infrastructure, and expanded successful PPPs.

Program 4: Institutional results-focused development and agricultural cross-cutting issues. i)
Enhanced capacity of agriculture and livestock sector and its institutions to deliver efficient and effective
agricultural services that expand access to both female and male farmers; ii) Improved policy
environment for enabling rapid, private-sector driven, and sustainable agricultural growth; and iii)
Enhanced food security and nutrition for a larger proportion of rural and urban households.

PSTA 3 Cost Scenarios and Indicative Financing Plan

16.     PSTA 3 has two costed scenarios representing a mix of public and private sector
investments over the five-year period. The first is a “high-cost scenario” totaling US$1.9 billion of
agricultural public investments, and the second, a “medium-cost scenario” totaling US$1.2 billion with a
higher level of private sector investment. Projected resources available from both the Treasury and DPs
for PSTA 3 are projected at US$1.2 billion. Given an unrealistic budget gap of US$700 million under the
“high-cost scenario,” the PforR operation will support PSTA 3’s “medium-cost scenario.” Based on the
available information from DPs and the government (Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning/MINECOFIN), this medium-cost scenario is fully funded. In addition, the ASIP’s “medium-cost
scenario” articulates a set of more sharply defined expenditure priorities (see criteria below) that have
strong linkages to strategic outcomes and outputs and the key drivers of PSTA 3’s RF and its results
chain, thereby enhancing the prospects of achieving the main objectives and targets. The PforR’s RF is
derived from PSTA 3 RF based on the “medium-cost scenario.” The main differences between the
assumptions in the two scenarios are as follows:
     PSTA 3’s targets were revised significantly downwards to reach more financially achievable
        levels, especially for the five highest-cost SPs;
     PSTA 3’s prioritization criteria were more rigorously applied to a prioritized RF;

19
   For further details, see: CAADP 10-Year Results Framework: Accelerating CAADP Country Implementation: A Guide for
Implementers (NEPAD, 2014).
20
   The detailed RF for PSTA 3 shows the baselines and targets for each outcome, as well as the underlying results chain.

                                                             7
        Some unit costs were revised downwards based on savings that could result from -+cost sharing
         of public projects with farmers. Land conservation terraces and irrigation schemes were identified
         as areas where greater cost-sharing with farmers could be achieved;
        A strong enabling framework for private sector growth and development with a business-friendly
         regulatory environment and more aggressive investment promotion following the strategic theme
         set out above is expected to lead to greater private sector investment, especially in export crops
         and processed products;
        A review of the RF identified public sector projects that could be implemented by PPP
         arrangements. Further PPP opportunities were identified in coffee, tea, horticulture, irrigation,
         milk collection centers and dairy processing, meat processing, and hides and skins;
        Fertilizer, lime, and seed subsidies were fully phased out by 2017/18, with the private sector
         leading the farm inputs market;
        Agricultural research was significantly scaled up to provide more innovative technologies for
         farmers, which is critical for achieving yield targets; and
        Extension was improved and expanded to provide support and training for farmers.

17.     The medium-cost scenario is therefore one of lower costs, intended to bring costs within an
affordable range. The PSTA 3/ASIP costing exercise adopted the prioritization criteria developed as part
of the RF for PSTA 3, namely: the degree to which SPs/activities contribute to: i) Vision 2020 and
EDPRS 2 strategic objectives and targets (including agriculture sector growth of 8.5 percent p.a. and
reduced poverty levels; ii) increased crop and livestock productivity and food security; iii) inclusive
agricultural private sector investment; iv) enhanced market-oriented commercialization and value
addition; and v) agricultural export growth.

18.     Based on the medium-cost scenario, the total estimated cost for PSTA 3 public investments
is approximately US$1.2 billion (Table 2), with an additional indicative investment level of about
US$550 million from the private sector (including an estimated US$137 million for PPP activities).21
Overall, this level of funding is consistent with the GoR’s trend of increasing allocations to the agriculture
sector over the past five years (adjusted for inflation) and the proposed increases of funding by a large
number of DPs. The medium-cost scenario also involved improvements in the composition of the
proposed expenditure allocations, between and within programs and SPs, to generate more efficient and
effective expenditures in relation to contributing to PSTA 3’s targets.

19.     Nine of the 24 SPs comprise the key drivers of agriculture growth and poverty reduction –
as captured in the results chain – and cover 88 percent of the public ASIP. Accelerated and inclusive
agricultural growth driven by the nine SPs is enabled through linkages to the other 15 subprograms that
include expanded and enhanced market access, agricultural finance, and a supporting institutional
framework.




21
    Based on consultations with the private sector, the GoR expects that the lion’s share of private sector investment will be in
irrigation schemes, mechanization, the inputs subsector (primarily seeds and fertilizer), food and export crops (primarily coffee,

21.      PSTA 3/ASIP public sector implementation costs under the medium-cost scenario rise gradually
from US$229 million in 2013/14 to US$244 million in 2017/18, a total of US$1,213.0 million over the
five five-year ASIP period. Costs by program have a very different distribution under the medium-cost
scenario. Program 1 remains the largest program, accounting for just over half of all costs by 2017/18.
The revision of PSTA 3 targets in land conservation and irrigation down to more financially achievable
levels as well as the phasing out of subsidies on fertilizer, lime, and seeds bring Program 1 costs under the
medium-cost scenario to more affordable levels. Program 3 remains the next largest, with about 32
percent of implementation costs in the medium-cost scenario, but also with significantly reduced costs
arising from more financially achievable targets for the construction of rural roads. Reduction of Program
1 and 3 implementation costs under the medium-cost scenario creates the space to slightly increase the
allocation to Program 4 and significantly increase the allocation to Program 2. Agricultural research and
extension rises to 8 percent of ASIP implementation costs by the final year of ASIP in 2017/18.

22.      PSTA 3 financing is shown in Table 4, which reflects both existing and future commitments
from DPs. The funding modalities used for PSTA 3 are: i) sector budget support, representing 17 percent
of external funding to the sector (EU, DFID); ii) ongoing investment operations/projects, representing 35
percent (IFAD, USAID, Swiss, Netherlands, FAO, World Bank); and iii) the proposed PforR operation,
representing 12 percent (World Bank, USAID, with other DPs exploring the viability of providing co-
financing as part of ensuring aligned donor support to the sector).22 However, this co-financing would not
change the overall budget envelope and would not bring additional resources, but would mean switching
modalities from either sector budget support or project financing to programmatic financing (PforR). The
government, including the MINECOFIN, has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that the PSTA 3 is
funded in accordance with the medium-cost scenario, as illustrated in the proposed financing plan. To the
extent a funding gap emerges during implementation of PSTA 3, the government and DPs are confident
that they will be able to close the gap. Enhanced annual planning and budgetary systems and a
strengthened sector-wide M&E system will help ensure adequate and prioritized funding to achieve the
key targets. Private sector funding levels will be contingent on their specific and individual investment
decisions, and will reflect recent trends, coupled with significant improvements in private sector
strategies, an enhanced policy environment and sustainable incentive structure, and appropriate and viable
models of PPPs. The PforR support operation is helping MINAGRI operationalize this financing strategy.

23.      To accomplish the Program Development Objectives (PDOs), the Program finances the
following types of activities and expenditures: labor to construct terraces; labor and materials for small-
scale hillsides and marshlands irrigation systems; purchase of farmer equipment (tractors, power tillers,
planting machines, harvesters, post-harvesting machines, agro-processing machines); labor for training on
input use, extension services, and livestock production; subsidies for seeds and fertilizer; purchase of
livestock; funding of labor for agro-forestry, value chain research, and technology programs; labor and
equipment to expand Farmer Field Schools (FFS); training and capacity building of farmers’ and
livestock cooperatives and food, export, and livestock entrepreneurs; and equipment, materials and labor
for post-harvest infrastructure including storage and drying facilities, and community innovation centers.

24.    There are no high-risk activities in the Program which are or need to be excluded from the
PforR operation. A detailed description of the Program and its scope is outlined below.

25.     PSTA 3 program implementation started strong in the first eight months of 2013/2014,
following the same implementation pace as PSTA 2. PSTA 3 was designed taking into account key
lessons from PSTA 2, including the importance of enhancing public investment under PSTA 3 and
directing it in the most cost-effective and efficient ways to achieve the goals of EDPRS 2 and Vision
2020. Moreover, efficiently directed and managed public investment 23 is critical to induce private
investment, along with a more focused approach to promoting foreign direct investment (FDI).

26.     Assessment Results, Emerging Implications and Proposed Program Action Plan (PAP). The
Bank’s assessment mission (May 2014) and follow-up work involved a comprehensive review of the
PSTA 3 program, including review of its RF and the proposed ASIP . The review concluded that the
PSTA 3 program is strategically relevant, technically and economically sound, and well supported by
appropriate institutional arrangements from technical, fiduciary, social and environmental systems ’
perspectives. The agricultural expenditure analysis confirms the rationale for public funding, while
helping to rationalize further expenditure areas that can better be carried out with an expanded role of the
private sector. The expenditure priorities include inclusionary access and benefits to farmers and other
consumers to public sector investments which are classic public goods (e.g., nonexcludable agricultural
research) and which have been delayed because of a lack of private sector financing (e.g., post-harvest
storage); PSTA 3 will also promote actions that will remove such impediments in the future and PPPs.
The three assessments (technical, fiduciary, and environmental and social systems) identified specific
areas of risk and capacity “gaps,” and recommended priority actions to enhance the implementation

23
  To help ensure enhanced efficient and effective allocations and management, and accountability of the ASIP, MINAGRI has
carried out a mini-agricultural public expenditure review (2011-2013, as well as the sectoral MTEF of 2013/14 to 2015/16)),
which involved updating and deepening the Ag. PER carried out for the period 2008-2010. The results of this exercise are
incorporated in the ASIP, which is supported by the present PforR support operation.

success of the Program. These actions constitute the core of the PAP, which comprises five strategic
cross-cutting areas and their risk mitigation actions. Each SP includes priority capacity development
activities to ensure the results are achieved, and which also contribute to reduced risks.

27.    The GoR’s MINECOFIN requested the World Bank and other DPs to support the
implementation of PSTA 3 through a Program-for-Results (PforR) support operation.

28.      The PforR – to be financed by the proposed IDA operation and co-financed by other DPs –
will support a time slice (three years out of five) of the national PSTA 3 program (“medium-cost”
funding scenario), including funding for the four programs and 24 SPs, as outlined below. PSTA 3
is a five-year program (from 2013/14 to 2017/18), and the PforR support operation would initially support
the first three years (from 2013/14 to 2015/16), with potential additional financing for the last two years
(2016/17 and 2017/18). The three-year funding window was requested by the MINECOFIN to align with
the IDA funding envelope available to the country.

29.      The main focus of the PforR operation will be to support the delivery of the strategic results
of the PSTA 3 program, while also providing value-added contributions to the content and
processes required to efficiently and effectively implement PSTA 3, such as: i) strengthening the
implementation of key results and the underlying results chain in PSTA 3’s RF, while focusing on the RF
for the PforR operation, which emphasizes the “core drivers” of agricultural growth; ii) ensuring a sound
balance and composition and effective management of agricultural public expenditures towards key
“transformative “outputs/activities; and iii) supporting the action plans for accomplishing the key results
and areas where there might be implementation and results risks. Accordingly, the approach taken under
the PforR will be to strengthen the operationalization of a strong results chain of the core drivers of the
PSTA 3 program at the central level and in all 30 Districts. In this manner, the Bank’s support will focus
on leveraging strategic results for the overall PSTA 3.

30.     The PforR will support core components and activities of PSTA 3, while recognizing
important linkages and synergies across the four programs and their SPs. While 88 percent of the
ASIP is allocated to nine SPs (considered core components), it must be noted that accelerated and
inclusive agricultural growth is being driven and enabled through strategic and operational
linkages between the nine SPs and the other 15 SPs. These linkages include expanded and enhanced
market access, agricultural finance, and support to PSTA 3’s institutional framework. As a result,
the six core drivers of agricultural growth and poverty reduction, as captured in PSTA 3’s results
chain, are integrated throughout all 4 programs and 24 SPs, thus ensuring that the design of PSTA
3 is both strategically relevant and technically sound to deliver on the government’s key
development objectives and targets. Therefore, the focus of the proposed PforR operation, through
the Bank’s and other DPs intervention and financing, will be to support the efficient and effective
operationalization of these six key “core transformational drivers” of inclusive agricultural growth
(see Table 5).

of the Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and expand the development of value chains.

Program Development Objective: The PDO is to increase and intensify the productivity of the Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and
expand the development of value chains.

The proposed operation supports the Government of Rwanda’s strategic objectives of the Transformation of Agriculture Sector P rogram Phase 3 with
aims to enhance food security and nutrition contributing to reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation supports four broad
program areas: i) agriculture and animal resource intensification; ii) research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; iii) value chain
development and private sector investment; and iv) institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues.

  The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index was developed and is currently being compiled by IFPRI, with a focus on the countries
supported by the Feed the Future Programme (supported by USAID). Rwanda is included in the coverage and tracking of this index. The index
includes the increased percentage of women in the total membership and leadership positions of agricultural farmers’ organizations and cooperat ives.

                                                                          15
   33.      Disbursement-Linked Indicators (= “Driver” Linked Indicators). The PforR operation funds
   will disburse against the proposed agreed disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). The DLIs focus the
   disbursement of funds in accordance with evidence of achieving a selective set of strategic and
   monitorable targets, hence encouraging the achievement of predetermined and tangible results. The
   selection of the specific DLIs takes into account the following criteria: realistic balance between output
   and outcome indicators; focus on “highly” strategic interventions whose effective implementation will
   help operationalize the “drivers” of achieving PSTA 3’s goals and also contribute towards the higher-
   level impact targets of PSTA 3 and help address some of the key risks of the Program. Accordingly, Table
   7 highlights the proposed DLIs and the rationale for each; Table 8 presents the DLI matrix (with an
   indication of the allocation of IDA resources for each of the agreed results); Table 9 shows the DLI
   verification protocol arrangements; and Table 10 presents the disbursement of Bank funds.

   (Outcome/Output Levels)                        (Baseline and Targets - figures refer to cumulative amounts)
1. Increased soil erosion            DL1: Annual increases in terraced land area (progressive and radical), based on agreed
control                              technical standards (figures are cumulative)
                                           Baseline 2012: 802,292 ha progressive; 46,246 ha radical
                                              Target by end of 2015: 903,240 ha (progressive); 69,640 ha (radical)
                                     Rationale: Expanded terraced land comprises the key source of sustained productivity
                                     increases for vast areas of depleted soil (and also contribute toward reduction of
                                     productivity losses).
2. Increased area under              DL2: Annual increases of irrigated area (ha) in marshlands and hillsides, based on
irrigation and adequately            agreed technical standards, with adequate O&M (figures are cumulative)
maintained                                 Baseline 2012: 3,075 ha hillsides, 24,721 ha marshlands
                                              Target by end of 2015: 6,075 ha hillsides, 30,121 ha marshlands
                                     Rationale: Expanded irrigated area comprises a strategic source of increase in crop
                                     productivity, diversification and value-added activities.
3. Increased average productivity    DLI 3: Increases in average crop yields per ha. for key food and export crops and

                                              Target for 2015: 2.7 kgs of cherry per tree per year

                                               Target for 2015: 5.5 ltrs/day
                                     Rationale: Increased crop and livestock productivity is vital to achieve overall sector
                                     growth rate target and reduced poverty; the proposed crops/livestock commodities are
                                     cultivated primarily by smallholders.

                                     Rationale: Enhanced technology introduction/transfer/dissemination/adoption from
                                     global, regional and national markets, in an integrated and coordinated manner,
                                     comprise core drivers of agricultural growth and generate strong synergies with rural
                                     infrastructural investments and policy reforms supported by PSTA 3.

sector (including production,                  Target by end of 2015: 7.0%
agrotraders and agroprocessing)      Rationale: To enhance private sector investment in agriculture, including farmers and
                                     other private entities, and to increase agriculture productivity, a key and critical factor
                                     is accessibility to sufficient, affordable, and timely finance is necessary to purchase
                                     capital goods including equipment and post-harvest infrastructure, and to secure
                                     improved inputs and technical assistance.

                                     Rationale: The achievement of ambitious targets under PSTA 3, especially
                                     considering the large proportion of women farmers, requires a significantly enhanced
                                     and effective operational MIS for the agriculture sector, at various levels.

                                     Rationale: Expanded access to and effective utilization of seeds, fertilizer and
                                     agricultural finance by a larger number/proportion of smallholders, coupled with
                                     expanded role of the private sector, require important policy enhancements and their
                                     effective implementation.

   The allocation of funds refers to the IDA contribution. To the extent other DPs participate in supporting the PforR, it is understood that their funding would be allocated to the
same DLIs, according to a similar pattern of distribution (in agreement with the Common Framework of Engagement of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund-MDTF). DLIs 1, 2, 3 and 8
have 2-3 subindicators with different targets. The allocation of funds will be equally distributed among the subindicators based on 75 percent minimum completion.

   Crop yields are reported on a calendar year basis (January to December), hence it is understood that the verification of the yield results would take place during the first two
months of each year.

Verification Process of DLIs. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will verify and validate all results achieved, including attainment of the targets
for the DLIs, which is required for the disbursement of funds (see Tables 9 and 10). Discussions with the PMO confirmed the following
conclusions: i) conducting the independent verification of the DLIs is in line with the PMO’s institutional mandates (including promoting
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the use of public resources); ii) PMO has the required technical and financial capacities to carry out this
verification task; iii) if needed, the PMO can contract the services of a specialized technical assistance entity to provide technical support in the
independent assessment of the DLIs. For example, the PMO currently contracts the support of such an institution (IPAR) for verification of


fertilizers). RAB’s draft Strategic Plan outlines the priority research tech nologies to be introduced and released for four major types of technologies, including: i) land mgt/soil
erosion control: agroforestry practices; composting and liming technologies to enhance site-specific recommendations; soil testing technologies to enhance fertilizer efficiencies;
ii) agricultural research: new improved crop varieties which would be higher yielding, disease and pest resistant, and drought-responsive (e.g., Irish potato, rice, maize, cassava,
horticulture); improved animal breeds/genotypes; iii) agricultural extension: enhanced extension models/approaches to promoting enhanced fertilizer application methods;
improved seeds/varieties; composting; and iv) Livestock: improved animal breeds (building on current traditional stocks); improved animal feeds; enhanced technologies for small
stock.
42
   Adoption rates refer to farmers who adopt these improved/new innovations (as defined above), and those introduced two years previously (to account for the lag in adoption
rates). Innovations can come from abroad or can be generated within the country.
43
   Key milestones of action plan to be implemented will need to be agreed (within two months after submitting the action plan).

                                                                                            19
performance contracts; and iv) PMO has expressed a positive response to undertaking this task (which will be formalized by government). Since
the PMO is already doing this type of performance assessment task, has implementation capacity, and its performance assessment capacity can
easily be strengthened, it is agreed by the government and the Bank that the PMO carry out this function (other options were also considered).

34.     Accordingly, the PMO would: i) perform ex-ante site visits and conduct field survey measurement and assessment; ii) confirm that
specified achievements have been completed based on relevant documentation, and standards specified in the verification protocol (i.e., policy
work, M&E reports); and iii) provide independent technical verification of the yield statistics of national averages, for the baseline period and for
figures generated and agreed by MINAGRI/RAB/NAEB and District agronomists (in line with current practices, which are expected to be
improved over the next two years). Once confirmed, MINAGRI will present a verification report to the World Bank, upon which the agreed full
disbursement or portion thereof will be made to the GoR.

                      Table 11: Overview of PSTA 3 and Ag. PforR Operation

  PforR Development Objective: The proposed program development objective (PDO) is to increase
  and intensify the productivity of the Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and expand the
  development of value chains.

  The proposed operation supports the Government of Rwanda’s strategic objectives of the
  Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 with aims to enhance food security and
  nutrition contributing to reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation supports
  four broad program areas: i) agriculture and animal resource intensification; ii) research, technology
  transfer and professionalization of farmers; iii) value chain development and private sector
  investment; and iv) institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues.

                             Programs and Subprograms/Key Activities

  Program 1 Agriculture and animal resource intensification: soil conservation and land
  husbandry; irrigation and water management; agricultural mechanization; agrochemical use and
  markets; seed development; and livestock development.

  Program 2 - Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers: Research and
  technology transfer; extension and proximity services for producers; farmers’ cooperatives and
  organizations.

  Program 3 - Value chain development and private sector investment: enhanced environment to
  attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship and facilitate market access; development of
  priority and competitive value chains: food and export crops, dairy and meat, fisheries, apiculture;
  agricultural finance; market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest.

  Program 4 – Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues: institutional
  capacity building, decentralization in agriculture, legal and regulatory framework, agricultural
  communication statistical systems, M&E and knowledge management, gender and youth in
  agriculture and environmental mainstreaming in agriculture; and enhanced nutrition and household
  vulnerability reduction.

  Geographical Scope: National (including 30 Districts).

  PSTA 3/ASIP Implementation Period and Cost: 2013/14-2017/18. Medium-cost scenario is
  US$1.2 billion (US$1.750 billion with private sector investments).

  Ag. PforR Implementation Period and Funding Sources: 2013/14-2015/16. Funding sources:
  government, DPs (including IDA for US$100 million), and private sector (IDA). See Table 3 for
  further details on the financing plan of PSTA 3 (medium-cost scenario).

36.      In February 2011, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) Public
Sector Window approved a US$50 million grant to co-finance the Rwanda Land Husbandry, Water
Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Program (LWH), whose objective is to increase the productivity and
commercialization of hillside agriculture in target areas. GAFSP resources have funded activities
identified in Rwanda’s ASIP to help farmers transform hillside agriculture to reduce erosion and bolster
productivity in an environmentally sustainable manner. GAFSP support has assisted in increasing

                                                   25
production of high-valued horticultural crops on irrigated portions of hillsides by smallholders, and
improved productivity and commercialization of rainfed food and export crops on the nonirrigated
portions. GAFSP funding allowed expansion of the program to seven additional catchment sites. GAFSP
additional financing increased the areas protected against soil erosion by 5,775 ha and increased land
under irrigation by 1,155 ha. This brings the project total to 10,375 ha of sustainably managed hillsides,
including a new total of 2,055 ha of irrigated land. GAFSP additional financing will allow the project to
reach an additional 6,000 households, from an expected 5,000 households to a total of 11,000 households
(or 44,000 direct and indirect beneficiaries).

37.     The GoR intends to scale up the program to the national level. Depending on further
financial requirements, the government may apply for additional GAFSP financing. Also, during
implementation of the GAFSP-funded LWH program, a number of potential private sector investments
were necessary to reach the full impact of the public sector funding and recent policy reforms (i.e.,
development of the seeds, fertilizer, and mechanization markets, post-harvest infrastructure, and
agricultural finance). Thus, the GoR would like to facilitate access to the GAFSP Private Sector Window
for US$50 million for 5-10 potential private sector investments where equity investments, guarantee, and
IFC involvement would help to catalyze the needed private sector investments.

38.      Role of the DPs. DFID, IFAD, FAO, EU, and the Netherlands are already providing
technical assistance (TA) to address capacity gaps and actions defined in the PAP. These DPs are
planning to expand their TA support over the PSTA 3 period to cover these same areas and other
aspects that will achieve the PSTA 3 targets. These same DPs are also part of the ASWG, which
provides an important forum to coordinate the complementarity of TA interventions, also as part of the
annual planning and budgetary processes. As part of the CAADP process, DFID, USAID, IFAD, and the
EU made a MOU commitment (June 2014) to MINAGRI to support the programmatic approach to PSTA
3. Discussions are underway to explore the most appropriate modalities to be followed by these DPs,
including co-financing the PforR operation. While these commitments would not bring additional
resources for PSTA 3 (apart from the figures shown in Table 3 to fund PSTA 3 costs), they would
potentially change the modality from sector budget support and project financing to programmatic
support (i.e., PforR). Having multiple DPs finance the PforR operation would streamline and reduce
transaction costs for the Ministry by having one mechanism with agreed upon results and a common set
of disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). It would also simplify the financing to support strategic results,
whether policies, impacts, outcomes, and/or outputs. DPs who wish to provide co-financing under the
proposed PforR operation will follow the same procedures as the PforR.

39.     Development Partner Co-financing. Once co-financing of the PforR by other DPs is
confirmed, the most appropriate mechanism for their co-financing will be established (i.e., parallel
financing, co-financing, establishment of a multi-donor trust fund, etc.) To the extent that other DPs
participate in co-financing the PforR, it is understood that their funding would need to fit in the overall
program envelope under PforR financing and would be allocated to the same DLIs, according to a similar
pattern of distribution (in agreement with the Common Framework of Engagement/CFE) of the MDTF.
All existing procedures of the PforR mechanism (i.e., DLIs, verification protocols, PAP, Program
Implementation Support, etc.) would apply to all co-financing provided to and from the MDTF.




PART B: Description and Assessment of Program Strategic Relevance and Technical Soundness

relevance, Annex 4 for detailed description and assessment of Program technical soundness, and
Annex 5 for detailed description and assessment of Program institutional arrangements.

i.      Strategic relevance

41.       Overview. In spite of the progress in reducing the number of poor households, the challenge
of poverty reduction remains high, as 80 percent of the rural population consists of subsistence
farm families with an average land size of 0.59 ha (EICV 3). Between 2008-2012, increased
productivity and production along with increased commercialization of production and increased off-farm
self-employment generated by increasing the number of food and export crop value chains were
responsible for: i) over 45 percent of poverty reduction (and up to 58 percent if all off-farm self-
employment is the direct result of increased self-employment associated with farm commodities); and ii)
facilitating over 1 million Rwandans to lift themselves above the poverty line. Given these facts, the
strategic objectives of PSTA 3 are both critical and relevant and with the right focus will lift an additional
3 million Rwandans out of poverty.

42.     The four programs of PSTA 3 and their associated SPs are similar to PSTA 2 in structure
and content, with increased emphasis on increasing private sector investment in the sector and
mainstreaming some strategic themes (e.g., gender, capacity development at all levels). PSTA 2 was
highly successful and delivered on over 90 percent of the planned results. In addition, many of the results
and targets were exceeded and some by as much as 200 percent.

43.     The World Bank technical team reviewed and evaluated all four programs and their SPs
and concluded that both the high-level PSTA 3 strategic objectives and the strategic objectives and
content of each of the four SPs and 24 SPs are of high-level strategic importance, necessary, and
relevant to achieving PSTA 3’s key results and desired impacts. They also address the key
developmental issues in the sector to promote sustainable economic development and reduce poverty.
They are of critical importance to transforming small subsistence farmers into commercial and market-
oriented farmers and to promoting the development of value chains, which provide off-farm employment,
and to securing improvements in food and nutrition security. The program has a suitable focus of
proposed allocations of public expenditures which are complementary to policy reforms and to promoting
private sector investment, with an appropriate mix of planned PPP investments. The public expenditure
planning processes (medium-term and annual) also are sound and are expected to play an important role
in ensuring funds are allocated to the priority expenditure programs/activities. The proposed strengthened
MIS is expected to help ensure that sound expenditure priorities are efficiently and effectively allocated
and managed. A detailed review of the relevance of each program and its SPs, as assessed by the World
Bank are as follows.

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

44.      The SPs of soil conservation, land husbandry, irrigation and water management,
agricultural mechanization, agrochemical and organic fertilizer use and markets, improved seeds,
and increased productivity of animal resources are all of strategic relevance to the achievement of
PSTA 3’s objectives. To transform the farming and livestock subsector into a productive, high-value,
market-oriented subsector, increased soil conservation and land husbandry, increased coverage of
irrigation, improved water management, improved agricultural mechanization, increased use of both
agrochemical and organic fertilizers, increased access to markets, improved seed varieties, improved
productivity of animal resources and quality of animal products for improved transformative growth of
the livestock subsector, with a focus on smallholders, are all highly relevant and are of critical
importance.

                                                     27
45.      Soil conservation and land husbandry are of the utmost importance to increase agricultural
productivity since most Rwandan soils are depleted in nutrients and subject to higher rates of
erosion. Rwanda loses up to 40,000 tons of soil per year to erosion and only 73 percent of arable land is
covered with some type of erosion control infrastructure. However, the effectiveness of this infrastructure
is only 53 percent.44 Reducing erosion and improving the quality of the soils is of strategic importance to
increase productivity and achieve PSTA 3 objectives. Irrigation and water management is also extremely
important to address pressing climate change and reduce dependency on rainfall, which can be erratic and
cause crop failure. So far only 23,000 ha of land are irrigated and the target is to increase this to 63,000 ha
over the PSTA 3 period through irrigation development in marshlands and hillsides. Currently, 13 percent
of farm operations are mechanized in Rwanda, including land preparation, planting, crop treatment,
harvesting, post-harvesting, and agroprocessing. Nutrient depletion rates in Rwanda are estimated to be in
the order of 77 kg/ha, among the highest in Africa. Increasing and sustaining agricultural productivity
growth requires a deliberate effort to ensure large-scale increases of inorganic fertilizers from 35 kg/ha to
45 kg/ha by 2018. Seed is an essential, strategic, and relatively inexpensive input to agriculture with a
high rate of return on investment that often sets the upper limit for crop production. In a landlocked,
mountainous, and high population density country, limited arable lands and access to natural resources,
including pasture and water, remain the major constraints and bottlenecks to livestock development and
competitiveness. Therefore, livestock intensification, productivity increase, and animal production
diversification (fisheries/beekeeping) are the best strategy for livestock development.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

46.     Research, technology transfer, professionalization of farmers, and extension services for
producers are of key strategic relevance towards the achievement of PSTA 3’s strategic objectives
and targets. No credible productivity and commercialization gains can be made without an effective
technology development and transfer system, tailored to Rwandan conditions. Equally, the envisaged
expansion of private sector investments will only occur if investors are assured of enough trade volumes
and of the organization of farmers into formalized groups, able to mobilize and collect adequate trade
volumes. Professionalization of smallholder farmers and their organization into cooperatives and other
farmer groups are necessary to ensure economies of scale in input and output markets, and to give farmers
the necessary clout to bargain and benefit from market-driven trade relationships.

47.      The current research and technology transfer functions are dominated by the public sector
through the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), which has the mandate to undertake agricultural
research for crops and livestock, agricultural development (mainly extension and input supply), animal
resource development, and provision of rural infrastructure (mainly storage facilities) and mechanization.
The 30 District administrations also play a key role in delivery of extension services at the local level
(based on a 3-tier structure and outreach system—District, Sector, and Cell levels). Community
participation and community-led solutions were highlighted as good practices throughout the PSTA 2
period. Rwandan agricultural policies and strategies focus on intensification and increased market
orientation of the smallholder agriculture sector, and farmers’ cooperatives are seen as an important and
principal vehicle to achieve this goal. The number of agricultural cooperatives in the country expanded
rapidly over the past few years – from 645 in 2008 to 1,877 in 2013. PSTA 3 envisages increasing the
number of cooperatives to 2,500 by 2017-18, as well strengthening them to be more effective in serving
their members.

48.     Creating an environment to attract expanded and inclusive private investment to the
agriculture sector, encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate market access to both inputs and
outputs is strategically important for agriculture sector development. Continued intensification and
commercialization of the Rwandan agriculture sector is essential to drive inclusive economic growth and
reduce poverty. Developing, rapidly expanding, and diversifying competitive food and export crops
remains one of biggest contributors to the theme of rural development and economic transformation of
EDPRS 2. Program 3 implements programs aimed at expanding and diversifying food and agricultural
exports in areas where Rwanda has a proven comparative and competitive advantage to accelerate
economic growth and increase rural incomes and food security. Expanded and inclusive access to viable
agricultural loans and enhanced recovery rates are increasing the volume, variety, and accessibility of
agricultural finance products; hence, aiming to increase the number of commercial loans extended by the
commercial banking industry is strategically sound. Market-oriented infrastructure (including rural feeder
roads and post-harvest infrastructure) is considered a critical factor for stimulating increased agricultural
production and commercialization.

49.      Enhancement of food security and nutrition remains a key strategic objective of the GoR.
Food crops, which include commodities that can be regionally and internationally tradable but
exclude crops produced for export only, account for 85 percent of agricultural GDP . Another GoR
objective is to double per capita milk consumption, from about 36 liters/person/year to 80 liters. This
cannot be achieved by only increasing milk production; milk processing (an estimated 10 percent of milk
is currently processed) and marketing along the value chain also need to be promoted. Tea, coffee,
horticulture, pyrethrum, meat, and hides and skins are among the key export value chains prioritized for
support in PSTA 3 and this Ag. PforR. Rwanda has a proven comparative advantage in these four value
chains as confirmed by recent analyses (2014) and expanding private sector activities. The GoR envisions
a significantly greater role for the private sector in leading the planned expansion and intensification
programs in the priority value chains. Private sector feedback confirms that private investors are ready
and interested to take on an expanded role in all four value chains. Demand for fish and poultry products
is relatively low, but is fast growing and currently mainly fulfilled by imports (about half of the fish and
two-thirds of the eggs consumed, for instance). Therefore, the development of these value chains has a
strong potential for import substitution. The sustainability of any improvements in this sector will be
affected by the performance of agricultural loans, which will in return be reflected in the interest rates.
Having a supportive policy framework is particularly relevant in the context of agricultural and livestock
insurance, as the most convenient form of insurance (in terms of premium and coverage). Expanded
feeder road development will also contribute to social protection by promoting employment generation
through public works. Investments in storage capacities to hold the surplus production and reduce post-
harvest losses, and consequently maximize net profits for small-scale farmers and reduce food insecurity
are both key and necessary. MINAGRI estimates that farmers experience between 15-22 percent annual
post-harvest losses in cereals.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

50.      Derived from the RF for PSTA 3, the strategic objectives of institutional capacity building,
agriculture decentralization, legal and regulatory framework, agriculture communications,
statistical systems, M&E, gender and youth in agriculture, environmental mainstreaming in
agriculture, nutrition, and reducing household vulnerability are sound and highly relevant in their
contribution to agriculture growth and poverty reduction.

51.    Strengthening institutional capacity to fulfill its intended strategic role and to meet the
ambitious targets of PSTA 3 at impact, outcome, and output levels, as well as to ensure enhanced
governance in the sector, including significantly improved M&E systems and follow-up
mechanisms, are key. During the past year, a number of important initiatives have further

                                                     29
operationalized MINAGRI’s decentralization strategies at the operational level. Many of these activities
are ongoing, and are generally making good progress.45 The legal and regulatory framework, including
compliance with international sanitary, phytosanitary, and safety (SPS) standards, is a key cross-cutting
program of PSTA 3. Formalization of the National Irrigation Policy after the elaboration of the Irrigation
Master Plan (2010) is essential to put in place the foundation for sustainability of publicly developed
irrigation schemes and to allow the private sector to increase participation in development and operation
in irrigation. The gross value of production of organic agriculture is relatively small. However, given the
growing demand for organic products in the U.S., the U.K., local markets, Europe, and South Africa, the
potential for rapid growth exists. The low use of pesticides can be traced to demand ‐side as well as
supply‐side factors. Weak demand for pesticides results in part from farmers' poor knowledge of pest and
disease control methods, which in turn is compounded by the lack of research being done on chemical
pest control practices. The GoR recognizes the need to overcome small farmers’ challenges in obtaining
access to credit. The objective of having diversified agriculture and private sector-led agriculture result in
the need for investing in strong value chains especially for the export commodities. Developing the legal
basis for an agricultural catalytic fund will also ensure transparency and accountability while increasing
sources and methods of financing for new ventures.

52.      Agricultural Management Information System/MIS: M&E, Agricultural Statistics and
Knowledge Management. Based on the RF for PSTA 3, the strategic objective of the MIS, and its
component M&E, Statistical Systems, Knowledge Management, and Agricultural Communication,
is to strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness, access to and utilization of an enhanced management
information system (MIS) for the agriculture sector, which would contribute to enhanced
evidenced-based decision making. This would involve the following component systems (with the RF
outlining relevant outcomes and outputs): i) Monitoring and Evaluation system; ii) Agricultural Statistical
System, including enhanced national food security and nutrition information system; and iii) Agricultural
Communication System. Currently, these MIS components are operating in a fragmented manner, with
partial systems also operating in RAB, NAEB, and the three SPIUs, to meet their specific institutional
requirements. MINAGRI prepared an integrated M&E framework (in 2011) that is currently being
updated in support of implementing the recently prepared ASIP. This evaluation framework needs to be
aligned and harmonized with the RF of PSTA 3, and then operationalized so that it can serve as a useful
sector-wide tool to support the sectoral MTEF and MINAGRI’s integrated annual work plan and budget,
and also to help support and guide the relevant annual work plan and budgets and the M&E systems for
RAB, NAEB, and the three SPIUs.

53.      Environmental mainstreaming in agriculture through appropriate soil conservation
measures is of great importance and should be done through the promotion of integrated soil
fertility management programs combining the use of chemical and organic fertilizers to improve
productivity but also to preserve soil’s physical and chemical characteristics. Different techniques
implemented, such as composting, green manure, and organic mulching, will need to be scaled up
and promoted throughout the entire MINAGRI structure. These techniques improve soil’s organic
matter content, soil water retention capacity, infiltration rate, and microorganism activity.
Environmentally sound water management in irrigation schemes is very crucial to the sustainability of

45
  Several useful documents outline the decentralization strategy with respect to the agriculture sector, including the main
components, primary challenges and “gaps,” and ongoing actions. These documents include: Review of Decentralization in
Rwanda’s Agriculture Sector to Inform the Sector Strategy 2013-2018 (prepared by Landell Mills/ Veteffect for the European
Union), 2012; Progress Report of Technical Assistance to MINAGRI in Decentralisation, prepared by Aimable
Rusingizankekwe, March 2014 (this report provides the most up-to-date assessment of progress and further operational
recommendations); Supporting Fiscal Decentralisation in the Agricultural Sector Developing Guidelines and a Training Manual
for Utilization of Earmarked Grants to Districts, prepared by ETC East Africa Ltd, 2008; Sector Policy, Planning and Budgeting
Guidelines for the Agriculture Sector, prepared by MINAGRI (2008).

these schemes, and will be done through the adoption of appropriate irrigation schedules determining the
correct irrigation amount and answering the typical questions of what, when, how, and how much to
irrigate. This will lead to improved water use efficiency and avoid deep percolation and leaching of
specific nutrients that can harm soils over time.

54.      Environmental considerations in rural roads. The rehabilitation and upgrading works can
involve significant earthwork and construction of slide protection and drainage structures, as well
as embankments crossing marshlands. Potential adverse impacts include: loss of agricultural land and
vegetation due to excavation of land in road expansion and borrow areas; slope instability due to soil and
water erosion and operation of machinery; disruption of natural drainage/flow and flooding; pollution of
water bodies due to improper disposal of solid waste and spoil; and increased noise and air pollution in
the vicinity of construction sites. Climate change, if not mitigated, remains a major risk to agriculture
sector, considering that most (90 percent) of Rwanda’s crop and livestock production is rainfed. Food
security and nutrition is one of Rwanda’s key priorities. EICV identified that in 2012, about 460,000
households (21 percent) had poor or borderline food consumption patterns (82,000 households or 4
percent had poor consumption patterns, while 378,000 households or 17 percent had borderline). These
households are vulnerable to seasonal shortages and also have inadequate provision in the case of drought
or excess rainfall. The identified solution is coordinated, strengthened, and scaled-up, community-based
nutrition programs and information campaigns across the country.


ii.     Technical soundness

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification.

55.     The SPs of soil conservation, land husbandry, irrigation and water management,
mechanization, agrochemicals and markets, seeds and livestock development were reviewed and
found to be technically sound and of high relevance in accomplishing PSTA 3 strategic impacts.
These SPs are a continuation and refinement of those carried out under PSTA 2, which accomplished over
90 percent of its targets and surpassed many by up to 200 percent.

56.      Given that most Rwandan soils (90 percent) are on hillsides and that there are still soils that are
old and depleted in nutrients either due to erosion or overcultivation, the achievement of PSTA 3 will be
highly dependent on more effective use of soil. The programs under PSTA 3 aim at provision of
infrastructure for erosion control and rejuvenation of soil health. Tremendous achievements have been
documented in significantly enhancing soil conservation technologies, especially under World Bank-
financed projects. These technologies will need to be scaled up in a larger area of Rwanda.

57.       Most Rwandan agriculture is rainfed and climatic and seasonal variations negatively affect
agricultural production. For this reason, PSTA 3 has set ambitious targets of developing an additional
20,000 ha of irrigation, to reach a target of 48,000 ha of irrigated land nationally. This will comprise both
marshland and hillside irrigation. So far the maximum amount of irrigation infrastructure has been
developed by the GoR and has a significant amount of public good element. Since 2008, the GoR has
made irrigation development a key national priority to achieve sustainable production levels and to
mitigate climatic shocks. Institutions and policies have been put in place gradually to work on this key
priority.

58.     The total area suitable for mechanization is estimated at 1 million ha, which represents around 60
percent of the total cultivatable area. The expectation under PSTA 3 is to have about 25 percent of
Rwanda’s 2 million farmers’ farm operations mechanized by 2017; i.e., 500,000 Rwandan farmers would
either own and/or hire mechanization services. Initial experience suggests that the mechanization strategy

                                                     31
is technically sound, but has to be expanded to include simple mechanized tools to cater for smallholder
farmers who cannot access large-scale mechanization without financial support from the government
and/or DPs.

59.      MINAGRI’s focus on increasing the adoption of improved inputs is predicated on the belief that
current fertilizer consumption is well below levels that could be profitable. In general, fertilizer could be
used profitably in a wider range of zones and communes in the production of maize, sorghum, Irish
potatoes, sweet potatoes, and climbing beans as well as for irrigated rice, horticultural crops such as
cabbage, and inoculated soybeans. Some progress has been made at the national level to support seed
sector development. To produce, conserve, and treat seeds to be kept safely for a long time, a Rwanda
Seeds Enterprise (RSE) was established in 2010. Beyond these national endeavors, RAB’s Seed Project
program has formed strategic alliances with various continental and regional bodies to add value to their
activities. RAB links up with New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) frameworks. Within the EAC, RAB collaborates with
ECAPAPA (Eastern and Central Africa Programmes for Agricultural Policy Analysis) and ASARECA
(Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa) for harmonizing
Rwanda’s seed policies. It is also involved in the EAC seeds standards harmonization effort being led by
the Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS). Rwanda is also a member of African Regional Intellectual
Property Organization (ARIPO). In other words, Rwanda has laid the foundation for establishing a
technically sound seed sector linked to regional and subregional initiatives. These roles and arrangements
are reflected in a new seeds policy currently under discussion.

60.      For the livestock sector, PSTA 3 and its overall results chain are technically sound and most of
the proposed indicators would measure well the progress towards achieving PSTA 3’s strategic objectives
and the PforR operation’s results. The growth of some subsectors of animal production (such as dairy) has
been impressive in the past 15 years, demonstrating a sound strategy and overall good implementation. It
is worth noting that the lack of lands and pasture as well as availability and accessibility of feed are
identified as key bottlenecks to livestock intensification and productivity increase in the country.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

61.      The SPs of research, technology transfer, and professionalization of farmers are key in supporting
the main drivers of agriculture and animal resource intensification and food and export value chains. The
SPs were found to be technically sound in their focus on improving, refining, and scaling up key
investments in research, extension, and professionalization of farmers to support agriculture growth
targets.

62.     RAB is mandated to conduct scientific and technical development of agricultural and animal
resources in Rwanda to improve the livelihoods of low-income farmers. The institute carries out research
and promotes technologies in crop production, livestock, forestry, agroforestry, post-harvest management,
land conservation, and water management. Research is grouped under three main program areas: crops,
livestock, and natural resources management. The research is conducted through multidisciplinary teams
and has moved from traditional research-extension linear processes to Integrated Agricultural Research
for Development (IAR4D), based on an “innovation platforms approach.” In this system, stakeholders
(farmers, scientists, traders, local authorities, NGOs, and the private sector) are becoming increasingly
involved in the research process, from priority setting and technology development to technology transfer.
The research program is therefore found to be technically sound and in line with the objectives of the
PSTA 3 program.

63.      Extension for producers is a key intervention implemented under the CIP, which is based on three
pillars: i) land use consolidation; ii) improved seed and fertilizer use; and iii) proximity of extension

                                                     32
service to farmers. RAB and Districts have adopted a Farmer Field Schools (FFS) approach, which
emphasizes farmer-to-farmer extension. In the changing context for rural smallholders, where no blanket
recommendations exist in agriculture and collective action is required to access markets, farmers need to
organize, be innovative, and be able to adjust to changing situations. In this context, FFS have an
important role to fill in the development of locally-based innovations, to create knowledge for a
framework of action, and to boost local management and leadership skills, aspects not normally catered to
in regular training and extension based on technology transfer concepts. Despite the challenges that
accompany FFS in general, the Rwandan model is found to work well and is technically sound, especially
given the past recorded productivity gains, strong government support both at national and local levels,
and its effective dovetailing with other government community initiatives.

64.     The farmers’ cooperatives and organizations SP builds on the successful development of farmers’
cooperatives under PSTA 2, and ongoing flagship projects in the sector, such as LWH and RSSP 3. Five
key objectives highlighted in PSTA 3 are to: i) develop management and entrepreneurial capacities in
farmers’ cooperatives and organizations; ii) support farmers’ organizations’ participation in activities of
higher value, both at the farm level and in post-harvest handling and agroprocessing; iii) develop farmers’
organizations as vehicles to improve farmers’ access to inputs in a demand-driven way; iv) develop rural
women’s organizations and groups within cooperatives; and v) promote the growth of social cap ital to
provide farmers’ organizations with an enduring foundation for the longer run. MINAGRI has already
addressed the key issues of harmonization of various approaches and has a bottom-up institutional model
of cooperatives as part of preparation for the Ag. PforR; a policy to this effect has been approved in
principle by the Cabinet on institutional aspects of farmers’ organizations and farmer-to-farmer extension
systems. The key challenges now are to operationalize the new approach and mobilize necessary technical
assistance required to build capacity at the farmer and staffing level. The SP is found to work well and is
technically sound, especially given the past record on strengthening farmers’ cooperatives and
organizations.

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

65.      The specific objectives of increasing overall production, productivity, and value addition in target
value chains as well as creating an enabling environment conducive to increased private sector
participation are well aligned with the set target of increasing the value of exports in priority value chains
by 28 percent p.a. by 2018. Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage
entrepreneurship, and facilitate market access, develop priority food and export crop, dairy, meat,
fisheries, and apiculture value chains, increase access to agri-finance and market-oriented infrastructure
for post-harvest (including expanded coverage of rural feeder roads and post-harvest infrastructure) are
key areas of focus in the agriculture sector that have been found to be both strategically relevant and
technically sound to accomplish the key strategic objectives and results defined in PSTA 3’s RF.

66.      Early engagement with the private sector suggests intensification should be considered as a first
priority over expansion, given Rwanda’s land constrained environment, particularly in terms of expansion
of well-established, more traditional export value chains (tea and coffee). Intensification efforts could
very well be supplemented by expansion based on a clear value proposition for farmers in target areas.
The promotion of the eight priority food crops (bananas, wheat, maize, rice, Irish potatoes, cassava, soya
beans, and beans) is of critical importance to food security and nutrition, growth, and poverty reduction.
The emphasis of the value chain approach is found to be the best, especially since most farmers have
started to produce surpluses for the market after satisfying their consumption needs.

67.      Success in achieving export value chain targets will hinge on addressing infrastructure and
logistics challenges (e.g., cold chain) and successfully identifying promising PPP and greenfield
investment opportunities. For the tea, coffee, and horticulture subsectors, the expectation is that the

                                                     33
market can absorb the increased export volumes planned. In case of the pyrethrum subsector, the market
dynamics need to be better researched and understood to allow for a proper validation of the feasibility of
the targets set. The overall approach for the development of dairy, meat, fisheries and apiculture value
chains is technically sound, with a focus on feed-producing and -processing infrastructures (with strong
private sector involvement), but also development or enhancement of the legal and policy framework and
SPS standards.

68.      The action items to achieve expanded and inclusive access to viable agriculture loans and
enhanced recovery rates outcome include: i) development of a national agricultural finance policy; ii)
passage of a warehouse receipts (WRS) act and regulations; iii) M&E of existing agricultural financial
instruments; iv) construction of warehouses; v) MINAGRI’s facilitation of a value chain finance
relationship through contract farming; vi) in collaboration with agriculture financial stakeholders,
MINAGRI’s establishment and convening of agricultural finance forums; vii) in collaboration with other
stakeholders, MINAGRI’s provision of specialized training for bank officers in providing credit to
agriculture, including support in preparation of business plans; and viii) in collaboration with other
stakeholders, MINAGRI’s public awareness-raising regarding available financing instruments. These
actions are comprehensive, well-targeted, and technically sound.

69.      Market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest, including promoting an efficient and equitable
transport system for feeder rural roads investments, is a key strategic objective for both MINAGRI and
the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA). A common framework of engagement was prepared along
with the Transport Sector Master Plan, which provides strategic direction for development of feeder rural
roads throughout the country. A comprehensive feeder roads development strategy and program that
provides the framework for prioritization of investments, maintenance of feeder roads, and definition of
the institutional arrangements is currently under preparation. Rwanda has a road network of about 19,055
km, of which about 15,055 km is classified, and consists of: 1,211 km and 58 km paved national and
District roads, respectively; 1,538 km unpaved national roads; and 12,248 km unpaved District roads. The
unclassified roads network is estimated at about 4,000 km of predominantly very low engineering
standard earth roads; these principally constitute the feeder rural road network. However, these roads are
in a dismal state, and represent a major constraint to the mobility of the rural population, agricultural
inputs, and marketable surplus outputs. Farmers’ transport to markets relies predominantly on human
transport and Intermediate Means of Transport (IMT).

70.     Reducing staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level is important for
increasing the volume and value of staple crops within the market and available for consumption and for
increasing rural incomes. Post-harvest activities mostly occur before consumption. To reduce post-harvest
losses and at the same time improve intertemporal food consumption, the GoR initiated strategic grain
reserve activities in 2010. MINAGRI purchased approximately 7,000 metric tons (MT) of maize and
3,000 MT of beans from Season A production. In 2011, the Post-Harvest Taskforce purchased about
60,000 MT of maize and beans as a strategic food reserve with a potential to reach 200,000 MT. The
Post-Harvest Taskforce within MINAGRI has oversight and responsibility for the reserve activities.
These efforts provide a firm foundation and are technically sound for the management of post-harvest
losses.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

71.     Institutional capacity building, decentralization in agriculture, a legal and regulatory framework,
agricultural communication statistical systems, M&E and knowledge management, gender and youth in
agriculture, environmental mainstreaming in agriculture, and nutrition and reducing household
vulnerability are key enabling SPs that support the key drivers of agriculture growth and poverty
reduction and catalyze the achievement of PSTA 3’s strategic objectives and impacts.

                                                    34
72.      The PforR assessment mission findings and various recent capacity development diagnostic
assessments and their corresponding recommendations46 for this capacity development SP concluded the
following main points: i) there are adequate recent assessments of the capacity priority needs and required
strengthening actions of MINAGRI and its main agencies (RAB, NAEB) to carry out the proposed Ag.
PforR support operation. While there have been some assessments of Districts’ capacities to formulate
and implement agricultural programs, these have been limited in scope and depth. Nonetheless, there are
several recent assessments supported by the EU for both overall District capacities and agricultural-
specific47 capacities and required priority actions (2013 and 2014), also as part of support for enhanced
decentralization efficiencies and effectiveness; ii) in addition, a forthcoming exercise (later in 2014) for a
MINAGRI/District Working Group to consolidate and update the priority capacity needs and
strengthening actions, with special reference to ensuring the effective implementation of key actions
which will help achieve the proposed outcomes and outputs and targets of PSTA 3 as articulated in the
RF; and iii) the RF for this SP, including its underlying results chain, is technically sound.

73.      PSTA 3’s proposed SP on Decentralized Agricultural Services and its articulation in the RF is
technically sound. Each of the four components are appropriately linked to each other, and together will
contribute to the envisioned decentralization strategic objectives. A clear decentralization strategy and
road map (as reflected in the Decentralization Implementation Plan (DIP)) is propelling progressive
increases in fiscal decentralization to the 30 Districts. Ongoing reforms of MINAGRI and its
agencies/units (RAB, NAEB, and the three SPIUs) will further integrate its centralized structures and staff
into the subnational structure (especially at the District level) and its modus operandi in the provision of
expanded and enhanced quality of agricultural services, accompanied by specific capacity development
programs and interventions. Howerver, there is a need to further strengthen CD activities at the District
and sector levels; and expanded participation and transparency at the District levels.

74.       An Irrigation Master Plan (IMP) launched in 2010 established the baseline for required irrigation
development and identified the potential for developing irrigation infrastructure nationwide. The national
irrigation policy will allow operationalizing the IMP. Both the IMP and the national irrigation policy are
technically sound and provide both the framework and foundation for implementing key investments in
this subsector. Laws and regulations have direct consequence for inputs marketing, including registration
procedures, packaging and labeling requirements, quality control measures (e.g., pre-shipment inspection
and final retail inspection and enforcement) but these are critically inadequate currently. The Rwanda
Seed Law n°14/2003 was promulgated on May 23, 2003, and six Ministerial Orders (or regulations)
related to seeds adopted (the most recent one in 2011), while a national seed policy was promulgated in
October 2007. The law is under review consistent with the EAC harmonization protocols and contains
Plant Breeders Rights (PBR). More recently, Rwanda actively participated in the harmonization of EAC
seeds standards, now under public review before they are signed by the EAC Council of Ministers for
adoption by individual member states. Rwanda has yet to ratify the EAC SPS protocols. Once ratified, a
Presidential Order would have be required for implementation. A developed crops protection law has
been in Parliament for approval for about seven years now.

75.      Rwanda developed a fertilizer policy in 2007, but this is largely about the increased use of
chemical fertilizers without any recommendations and actions targeting the better use of organic
fertilizers. Such recommendations are important to improve extension system to raise farmers’ awareness
on the importance of organic fertilizer, demonstrate better methods of producing and applying organic
manure, reinforce investment in soil erosion control measures, particularly efficient radical terraces, and
reinforce integration of livestock production with crop production so that animal manure can be used for
crop production and crop byproducts can act as feed for animals. Currently, MINAGRI is finalizing a
more comprehensive fertilizer policy that aims to address these gaps.

76.      Based on the RF for PSTA 3, the strategic objective of the MIS (and component M&E, Statistical
Systems and Agricultural Communication) is to strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness, access to and
utilization of an enhanced management information system (MIS) for the agriculture sector that would
contribute to enhanced evidenced-based decision making. This would involve the following component
systems (with the RF outlining relevant outcomes and outputs): i) Monitoring and Evaluation system; ii)
Agricultural Statistical System, including enhanced national food security and nutrition information
system, and disaggregation of gender data; and iii) Agricultural Communication System. Based on
information provided in the RF, the overall strategic objective (SO) and supporting details (of outcomes,
outputs, indicators, baselines and targets) are sound, although they need to be further operationalized at
national and subnational levels.

77.      The overall goal of the Agricultural Gender Strategy (AGS 2012) is to contribute to poverty
reduction and sustainable development through institutionalization of a gender-responsive programming,
implementation, monitoring, and reporting system and to improve gender equality in the agriculture
sector. For MINAGRI, the strategic objective is to improve gender equality in the agriculture sector and
redress the existing disparities. The Ministry’s strategy aims at mainstreaming gender within MINAGRI’s
institutional and operational framework. The AGS covers all aspects of gender, from policy and strategy
to staffing and implementation, to ensure that women farmers have equal access to program benefits. 48
MINAGRI’s strategy and plan for mainstreaming gender throughout all agriculture sector activities and
functions are found to be technically sound.

78.     Mainstreaming environmental management in soil conservation and irrigation practices being
undertaken in PSTA 3 are key for sustainability of the various investments and for the environment. They
are necessary to maintain and restore ecosystems as close as possible to their natural state. The GoR has
put in place sound and strong environmental governance structures and systems that are also rooted
throughout the PSTA 3 program. The rural roads to be improved in PSTA 3 follow the existing alignment
and remain within the existing right-of-way, hence limiting adverse environmental and social impacts.
The policies state that to avoid adverse negative environmental and social impact, when a road proposed
for improvement has to be widened, no road contract tender should be launched before a road-specific
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) are prepared
and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) with mitigation measures is incorporated in
the bidding documents. Also, the 2011 National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon
Development is technically sound and will be used to guide overall planning for climate change.



48
   The main objectives of the AGS are to: i) institutionalize gender in the agriculture sector so that policies, processes, planning
and operational mechanisms and structures/programs are gender-sensitive; ii) develop capacities in the agriculture sector to
enable gender-sensitive programming so that technical, program and management of MINAGRI staff and stakeholders, and
decentralized entities have adequate capacity to engender MINAGRI programs; iii) enhance gender-responsiveness in delivery of
agricultural services; iv) promote equal participation in decision-making processes; and v) develop and coordinate partnerships
and collaborative mechanisms amongst government institutions, CSOs, private sector, and DPs and integrate appropriate actions
to respond to practical and strategic gender needs in the agriculture sector.

                                                                36
79.      MINAGRI recognizes its role and accountability to ensure availability of and access to
affordable, nutritious foods - to ensure food and nutrition security for all Rwandan citizens. One key
target of PSTA 3 is to ensure that at least 90 percent of Rwandan households have acceptable food
consumption. MINAGRI recognizes two approaches to improving access and availability of nutritious
foods. The first is increasing overall agricultural productivity, recognizing that increasing income will
result in more money spent on higher nutrient quality foods, including meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.
The CIP, started in September 2007, focuses on six core staple crops: maize, wheat, rice, Irish potatoes,
beans, and cassava. Under the CIP, farmers, who are organized in Self-Help Groups (SHGs), synchronize
the cultivation of crops. Farm inputs such as improved seeds and fertilizers were imported and distributed
to farmers through PPPs, and extension services on the use of inputs and improved cultivation practices
were rendered to farmers. The second approach is to increase diversity of available foods and “upgrade”
the nutrient quality of foods. The former was done through the promotion of home gardens, and the latter
by using biofortified staple crops wherever possible. Biofortified crops are bred with better nutrient
profiles by exploiting the natural variation between varieties of the same crop. The GoR has committed to
disseminating and promoting all biofortified staples that are or could be available in Rwanda. MINAGRI
encouraged and disseminated the first available biofortified staple crop, high-iron beans, within the CIP.
It also promotes cultivation of biofortified vitamin A-rich sweet potato. MINAGRI has requested the
vitamin A biofortified cassava currently available in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is
completing trials of vitamin A maize for release in 2015. In addition, soya was incorporated in the CIP to
increase its productivity to at least 1.3 MT /ha. Interventions focus on increasing the supply of soya for
processing, and potential use in a locally produced corn-soy blend, a nutritious supplemental food for
children. The Nutrition Action Plan addressing the above two areas is well prepared and costed for
recommended action lines and is technically sound.

iii.    Institutional arrangements

80.      PSTA 3 is implemented by MINAGRI in line with its current organizational and functional
structure and actors: four departments (Planning, Inspection, Crop Production, and Animal Resources);
two semi-autonomous implementing agencies (Rwanda Agriculture Board/RAB and National Agriculture
Export Board/NAEB); two Task Forces (Irrigation and Post-Harvest Infrastructure, which merged into
RAB as of July 1, 2014); three Single Project Implementation Units (SPIUs), which implement donor-
supported projects (World Bank, IFAD, African Development Bank); and 30 Districts (as part of a
decentralizing government structure). The central government, through MINAGRI, provides policy,
coordination, and financing leadership for PSTA 3, including strong harmonization and alignment of
development assistance. All other implementation responsibilities of PSTA 3 rest with the Task Forces,
RAB, NAEB, SPIUs, and Districts, which are enabled by various coordination mechanisms.
Implementation roles and approaches vary with a mix of national, District, community, and private
program delivery. Currently, the government is completing a government-wide restructuring exercise to
further streamline and enhance organizational and implementation efficiencies and effectiveness.
MINAGRI’s restructuring plan is currently under review for formal approval and its launch is expected
later in 2014. Some of the key guiding principles are to ensure an organizational and functional structure
that will promote and balance efficient execution and sustainability, including the integration of the
SPIUs in RAB and NAEB, and to establish a central-level SPIU to handle/coordinate central functions for
efficient implementation of PSTA 3 (including the PforR).

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

81.     Soil conservation and land husbandry activities are now implemented by different agencies
(RAB, Rwanda Environment Management Authority/REMA), local administration (Districts) and SPIUs
(LWH/RSSP, Kirehe Community-Based Watershed Management Project/KWAMP). While there is an
excellent amount of good work, there is also an apparent lack of coordination, harmonization, and

                                                    37
standardization of the different works and approaches for soil conservation and land husbandry. RAB has
set an established methodology for monitoring the coverage of soil erosion control infrastructure and will
report on the situation every two years, but RAB does not coordinate the implementation of different
works being carried out in other implementing agencies.

82.      Irrigation and water management are carried out by various agencies with different mandates,
such as GoR-funded programs (GFI, QWM) implemented by the Irrigation and Mechanization Task
Force (IMTF) and donor-funded projects (RSSP3, LWH, PAIRB, KWAMP). When projects close, the
infrastructure is handed over to beneficiaries under the guidance of the relevant District, but no single
national authority oversees irrigation schemes. The establishment of such a body is urgent, especially as
the IMTF’s term ended on June 30, 2014. The law establishing Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) was
approved and gives beneficiaries of irrigation infrastructure the obligation to maintain them. There are
provisions to provide training to both male and female members of WUAs on key issues, including:
dealing with schistosomiasis; applying lessons from Integrated Watershed Management (IWM)
experiences and developing IWM in additional watersheds; and developing hydrological information for
watershed management.

83.      Agricultural Mechanization. To popularize mechanization and achieve a target of 25 percent
mechanized farm operations by 2017, the GoR, through the IMTF, has driven the mechanization program
since 2008. An internally financed project, the IMTF was mandated to: i) promote mechanization options
for rural farmers; ii) develop local skills and strengthen capacity in agricultural mechanization; and iii)
promote mechanization in post-harvest activities. On June 30, 2014, the Task Force was phased out and
its activities absorbed within RAB. After the initial wave of investments, GoR plans to gradually
withdraw and hand over procurement and distribution of mechanization equipment to the private sector.
The government would scale down to 60 percent within the next three years and then phase out
completely thereafter, but would continue to ensure a conducive environment for private sector
investment through enabling policies and provide soft services such as extension, thematic studies, and
capacity building of relevant stakeholders. In a drive to attract private investors into the mechanization
sector, MINAGRI secured the services of three private investors: Way-Invest Ltd; Yanmar-Japan
(through Akagera Motors); and Mahindra-Indian (through ETC Agro). In addition, around eight
manufacturing companies, mainly of post harvesting equipment, were established.

84.      Agrochemical use and markets. Rwanda depends on imports for all of its agrochemical
fertilizer requirements because the country has no local production. MINAGRI has been the active
importer and distributer of fertilizer since 2008. However, it is gradually reducing its fertilizer subsidy
with the target of being completely phased out of it by 2018. It is also exploring ways to make the subsidy
more efficient and opening it up to all crops. The sector is committed to liberalizing the fertilizer
subsector and having the entire fertilizer value chain (from importing to supplying to farmers) operated by
the private sector, based on farmers’ demand. All of these reforms are reflected in a fertilizer policy paper
expected to be completed during 2014 and approved in 2015.

85.      Seed development. Seed production in Rwanda is dominated by producer cooperatives (60
percent) and individual farmers (40 percent). Under an input subsidy scheme, the GoR, through RAB,
purchases seeds of maize, wheat, rice, and Irish potatoes and through private agro-dealers delivers them
farmers free of charge to plant 0.5 ha. RAB floats tenders for the distribution of seed to beneficiaries after
procurement. Currently, pre-basic and basic seed multiplication is carried out in RAB stations located in
various Districts under the Agriculture Zone Division responsibility. Seed inspectors operate on all seed
fields registered after planting through the crop declaration. Each Province has a technical assistant in
seed production and a quality officer reporting to the National Seed Coordinator. Although RAB’s seed
program has a mandate to produce and market seed, in the spirit of private sector development, the


                                                     38
government decided to lessen its control of the seed sector, promote private investment, and phase out the
seed subsidy, all welcome news to the private sector.

86.      Livestock development. The human resources are inadequate in number (for instance, there is
one public veterinarian for all 416 sectors and one per District) and skills required. The World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Performance of Veterinary Service (PVS) evaluation report seems
to confirm the same for the animal health sector. Past experiences and implementation of livestock-related
projects (e.g., the AfDB-funded Livestock Infrastructure Support Project/LISP) have shown that the GoR,
through MINAGRI and RAB, knows how to implement and monitor results-oriented investments in the
livestock subsector.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

87.      Research, technology transfer and extension for producers. RAB has the mandate to
undertake research on all crops and livestock. To execute this mandate, RAB has a Directorate of
Research, headed by a deputy director general (DDG). The DDG is supported by senior scientists at the
national level and four zonal directors who lead the research and extension programs on crops, livestock
and natural resources. The extension function is implemented by the Directorate of Extension, also
headed by a DDG. The DDG of Extension is supported by a number of coordinators and specialists at the
national level. At the local level, extension services are implemented as part of the CIP with
implementation facilitated through Local Government (LG) structures working together with RAB. The
implementers include District agronomists and contracted service providers to support
cooperatives/producers engaged in CIP activities. RAB provides national support and oversight, while the
LG is charged with implementation at the District and lower levels. During 2014, RAB undertook an
institutional review, and proposed changes based on the need to improve the efficiency, accountability,
and sustainability of the delivery system, and to devote more earmarked funds to the local level. Through
the institutional changes, more RAB staff will be deployed to the zones and Districts to support
implementation and decentralization policies and directives. The research programs are also to be
consolidated to 16 at the zonal level. These changes are expected to be implemented from July 2014.

88.      Farmers’ cooperatives and organizations. At the village level, lead farmers and farmer
promoters will be responsible for farmer mobilization and capacity building. MINAGRI has defined
criteria for selection of farmer promoters, and has provided a platform for exchange and sharing of
knowledge (based on the health worker model). They have also recently connected with the cooperatives
in the sector. The FFS facilitators trained through the FFS approach are mapped at the Cell level (one per
Cell) to train farmer promoters. Agriculture committees are established at all levels to act as command
post and the roles and responsibilities include coordination, monitoring, reporting, mobilization, and
advisory. A permanent operation center/secretariat, composed of two to three members drawn from
MINAGRI and Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), is established in each District and at the
national level for day-to-day monitoring of activities. A national Agriculture Steering Committee
oversees the implementation of activities and provides policy guidelines. Cooperative training activities
also include nutrition training in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, involving community health
workers. MINAGRI already has experience (SPIU LWH/RSSP) and proven results with this field-level
training and technical assistance but this existing capacity needs to be mainstreamed and included in
MINAGRI’s capacity-building strategy.

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

89.      Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship, and
facilitate market access. NAEB is the key institution mandated to deliver the strategic objectives of
program 3 of PSTA 3. The institution has two main departments “Production Support & Value Chain

                                                   39
Development” and “Export Operation & Market Development,” which deal with the production and
marketing sides, respectively, of priority export crops. NAEB has wide-ranging responsibilities including
a regulatory function, conducting research and agricultural extension, licensing operators, setting quality
standards, issuing certificates of origin, training farmers and cooperatives (including men and women),
international marketing, and providing market intelligence. The new strategy envisions NAEB
increasingly focusing on its core function as regulator and creating a conducive environment for
encouraging the private sector to take on a bigger role in research, extension, and marketing of export
crops. NAEB is in the process of finalizing a medium-term export strategy firmly aligned with the five-
year EDPRS 2, PSTA 3, and the National Export Strategy.

90.      Development of priority food crop value chains. RAB has the institutional mandate to promote
food crop productivity interventions. To do this, RAB has identified several drivers of productivity which
include: the use of improved seeds, agrochemical fertilizers, and compost/manure; control of pests and
diseases; timely planting, maximum use of consolidated land; and promotion of banana production. The
GoR, through MINAGRI, RAB, and other agencies, has a subsidy program that targets maize, wheat,
beans, rice, Irish potatoes, and soya. Smallholder farmers growing these crops receive subsidized
fertilizers, seeds, and other planting materials. The level of subsidy varies with the type of crop and input.
While in the past government agencies were responsible for procurement and distribution of fertilizer and
other subsidies, there is a gradual move to directly bring on board private sector players. MINAGRI has
also intensified training of agro-dealers, including women, throughout the country to ensure farmers have
access to their services. Plans are underway to reduce the subsidy level for most inputs, with an objective
of phasing out direct subsidies by 2017/18. These government strategies for promotion of food crops and
the measures being taken to entice private sector players are considered adequate and robust to ensure that
PSTA 3’s targets are met.

91.      Development of priority export crop value chains. The capacity of NAEB could be described
as sufficient, considering the complementarities with LG structures to follow-up and support delivery of
all planned interventions. Coordination issues might arise where Ministry of Trade and Industry
(MINICOM) and MINAGRI intersect in processing activities and trade facilitation, but a coordination
mechanism (Industrial Development and Export Council/IDEC) was put in place to tackle the issue.
There is strong commitment, at all relevant agency levels, to implement the program, including having
export targets a key part of results performance agreements of the agencies involved. There is also
considerable experience and sector expertise with the key counterparts (MINAGRI and NAEB) around
planning for and supporting expansion of the coffee and tea subsectors.

92.     Development of priority dairy, meat, fisheries and apiculture value chains. In “small”
subsectors and value chains (but with high potential), such as fisheries and beekeeping, the capacity to
implement such a program is weak due to the lack of human resources (for instance, for beekeeping, there
are only two specialists in MINAGRI and four in RAB at the central level, and the subsector relies on
general veterinarians at the local level). Similar assessments are made in very specific areas that would
contribute to the overall objectives, such as milk quality and food safety.

93.     Agricultural finance. Currently, only one staff member in MINAGRI is in charge of the
agricultural finance agenda. While the individual is extremely competent and proactive, given the
requirements of the next steps to achieve the Program targets. this capacity is inadequate. Moreover,
while the Access to Finance Rwanda (AFR) is a unique platform through which pilots and assessments to
enhance agricultural finance can be implemented, it is not yet well positioned to support MINAGRI to
achieve its strategic objectives in this area.

94.     Market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest. This SP promotes efficient and equitable
transport systems. The engagement of multiple institutions (i.e., a decentralized road administration at the

                                                     40
District level with limited experience in managing development feeder roads investments) and not being
able to rely on good support from national institutions leads to an implementation challenge and requires
significant resource allocation to build capacity. MINAGARI, Ministry of Infrastructure (MINIFRA), and
MINALOC have capacity-building activities49 within each sector program and should be sufficient to
strengthen the Districts and national entities responsible for feeder roads oversight.

95.     Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level. To reduce
post-harvest losses, MINAGRI’s Post-Harvest Taskforce is implementing the Post-Harvest Strategy,
which involves a number of measures to address losses such as developing training materials, training
delivery, and provision of drying and shelling facilities and equipment to cooperatives and individual
farmers, as well as the adoption of quality standards. The Task Force has a Post-Harvest Extension
Department whose role is to undertake post-harvest extension work. The strategy is implemented through
Provincial Coordinators, who supervise District post-harvest extension officers. NGOs liaise with
MINAGRI to implement post-harvest handling and storage activities covering developing training
materials, training, and installing storage and drying facilities.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

96.      Institutional capacity building. MINAGRI and its two agencies (RAB and NAEB), its three
SPIUs, and the Districts have a designated focal person to coordinate capacity development (CD) needs
and initiatives, especially since various DPs are providing several types of CD assistance. For example,
MINAGRI has a designated Coordinator for the Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI). Given the
large number of Districts (30), the institutional arrangements for coordinating these CD initiatives vary. It
is envisioned that one of the outputs of the above CD assessment exercise is to recommend enhanced
institutional arrangements for coordinating and enhancing the M&E of the CD initiatives, with a stronger
results focus. A recent CD assessment (supported by USAID, 2014, reference cited above) concluded that
with respect to the food security system, there is a need for MINAGRI to improve the alignment,
consistency, and inclusive institutional arrangements and mechanisms for promoting effective dialogue,
evaluation platforms, and mechanisms for the public sector, private sector, civil society, and research
institutions. This type of strengthening would help sustain evidenced-based policy design and
implementation processes, which would enhance implementation of PSTA 3 and achievements of its
targets.

97.      Decentralization in agriculture. The GoR has a clear decentralization strategy and supporting
institutional arrangements and roles at the subnational level. However, there is less clarity at the level of
MINAGRI and its entities (RAB and NAEB) and SPIUs in terms of ensuring that their organizational and
functional structure and systems are well integrated and supportive of the envisioned expanded
decentralization of agricultural services. Currently, RAB and NAEB are finalizing their Strategic Plans to
be strongly aligned with PSTA 3’s RF, and the recently prepared ASIP. This includes working out
appropriate organizational, functional, and staffing structure reforms (including gender aspects) to
enhance decentralized agricultural services. During the Ag. PforR assessment mission, three key elements
were identified that will need continued strengthening at the District level, consistent with recent progress
reports – the need to strengthen the planning, budgetary, and M&E aspects of decentralization, which
involves all sectors, including agriculture. It will be important for MINAGRI to coordinate closely with


49
   Support to the Districts and national coordination entities’ capacity building, includes: i) technical assistance to Districts’
infrastructure, finance, procurement, environmental management, and planning units through adoption of systems and manuals
and provision of training to District staff; and ii) strengthening the capacity of national coordination entities through provision of
training on feeder roads development planning, monitoring, and maintenance for MINAGRI and RTDA staff.



                                                                 41
MINALOC and its CD initiatives at the District level, which include activities to address these three key
elements.

98.      MIS: Agricultural M&E, statistics and communication. Currently, the agriculture sector MIS
operates at the national and subnational levels, involving a relatively large number of diverse actors who
have specified and complementary roles in data collection and reporting, utilize various reporting
processes and mechanisms, and exhibit varying levels of capacity to deliver on their expected roles and
outputs. In addition, MINAGRI has a number of other data collection, reporting, and monitoring systems
and mechanisms that contribute to various reporting and communication requirements (especially to
monitor the annual performance contracts with various entities). Key actors at the national level include
MINAGRI (coordinated by the Planning Department) and its main implementation agencies (RAB,
NAEB, and three SPIUs). Each of these implementation agencies has its own M&E system; these are in
the early stages of being integrated into an overall sectoral MIS. The recent M&E framework assessment
exercise highlighted some of the challenges in the extent of fragmentation of M&E activities carried out
by the above actors, which tend to focus on monitoring the expected outputs outlined in their performance
contracts. MINAGRI’s recent initiatives to strengthen an integrated and sector-wide MIS need to be
continued, with an aim to meet the performance contract requirements, as well as PSTA 3 requirements in
tracking the impact and outcome level targets outlined in its “core” RF.

99.     Gender and youth in agriculture. A number of agencies are currently involved at the District
level in gender and youth issues (e.g., Ministries of Gender and Family Planning, National Council of
Women, and MINAGRI) and are working together. The focus is on building the capacity of agricultural
staff such as agronomists, livestock specialists, and local service providers (LSPs) to have gender-
responsive service delivery. The Ministry of Gender and Family Planning is the focal point and
coordinates gender-related work with other ministries. MINAGRI has prepared various training modules
for extension service agents and LSPs in gender-responsive service delivery.

100.   Environmental considerations in rural roads. REMA provides both guidelines and monitoring
implementation of national environmental safeguard measures including rural feeder roads oversight.
RTDA also has environmental and social specialists that monitor safeguard issues related to rural feeder
roads works. Districts also have environmental officers within their Environment and Water Resource
Management Units responsible for environmental and social safeguard aspects of rural feeder roads.

101.    Planning for climate change. Planning for climate change adaptation is done in accordance with
the 2011 National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon Development, with MINAGRI taking
the sector responsibility. Currently the focus is on risk assessment and vulnerability mapping through
modeling and creating a database. Several research programs towards enhancing climate change
adaptation and mitigation are also ongoing. Apart from these activities, there is limited institutional
capacity in the sector to promote and coordinate climate change issues. The greatest challenge is raising
various stakeholders’ awareness on climate change issues, particularly the farming community.
MINAGRI needs to enhance its capacity to promote and coordinate climate change issues with other GoR
ministries (e.g., Environment, MINALOC) and agencies such as RAB and NAEB.

102.     Nutrition and household vulnerability. While the GoR’s National Nutrition Policy can be seen
as top-down, implementation is at the District and local level –reflected by MINALOC being one of its
core owners. It is also reflected in the building of strategies based on District and sector strategies such as
the development of EDPRS 2. Seven ministries coordinate at the District level – there is a nutrition sector
working group with representation from MINISANTE, Education, Local Government, Gender, Disaster,
and Agriculture, with overall coordination under MINISANTE. Both MINISANTE and MINAGRI rely
on community-level implementation mechanisms. Health workers are the main agents of change at the
village level – there are two to three health workers per village. In MINAGRI, implementation is done

                                                      42
through the formation of farmers’ SHGs consisting of 12-20 farmers. MINAGRI staff are trained and
sensitized on gender, and both members and officeholders within the SHGs have to include 30 percent
women, with many exceeding this requirement. SHGs form the crux of MINAGRI’s implementation
strategy. Each SHG has five lead farmers trained in various aspects to help the group. One farmer is
trained in conflict management and social welfare to whom MINAGRI links community health workers.
In some cases, community health workers are also part of SHG, and are the lead farmers. Through this
system, all members of the farmer group are trained on healthy eating and food preparation, especially for
young children, using the production from their farms and home gardens. This is consistent with the goals
of the community health workers to reduce malnutrition in their communities. This could be extended to
more formal delivery of services by community health workers in the cooperative centers.


Part C. Description and Assessment of Program Expenditure Framework

103.     Public expenditure on agriculture through MINAGRI has shown a rapidly increasing trend in
recent years. Table 12 gives recent expenditure and the current MTEF budget for MINAGRI separated
into its recurrent and development components. MINAGRI’s expenditure and budget had substantial
increases in 2010/11 and in the current MTEF period starting in 2013/14. It is welcome that the
government has started to devote a greater share of its resources to agriculture. It should be noted that the
figures shown below do not reflect the total amount of public funds to the agriculture sector, given the
expenditures by other central ministries and by the 30 Districts. Around three-quarters of expenditure is
development expenditure due to the large internal and donor financed projects funded from the
development budget. The recurrent budget largely covers operational costs, including salaries and wages.

     104.     The proportion of government expenditure allocated to the agriculture sector through MINAGRI
     is rising and projected to reach 6.0 percent in 2014/15 (see Table 14). As stated above, MINAGRI does
     not provide all public funding in the agriculture sector. MINIRENA has significant soil conservation
     programs under its mandate to protect the environment and is also responsible for the forestry subsector,
     with MINAGRI only responsible for agro-forestry. MINALOC is responsible for Districts, the main
     vehicle for local service delivery including agricultural support services. When this funding for
     agriculture through other ministries is included, Rwanda surpasses the CAADP target of government
     spending on agriculture of at least 10 percent of total public expenditures. The ongoing Ag. PER will
     provide more accurate estimates of total public expenditure allocations to the agriculture sector.

     105.    Table 14 shows MINAGRI’s expenditures by program while Table 15 summarizes MINAGRI’s
     expenditures by agency. MINAGRI’s two implementing agencies (RAB and NAEB) are funded from
     MINAGRI’s budget. Most MINAGRI funds are retained centrally, reflecting the large internal and donor-
     funded SPIUs managed by MINAGRI. All agencies have seen a trend of increasing expenditure and
     budgets as the government has devoted increasing resources to agriculture.

     106.    Slightly under three-quarters of program expenditure and budgets are through the agriculture and
     animal resource intensification program. This program covers large internal and donor-funded projects in
     land conservation, irrigation, provision of farm inputs, and agricultural mechanization. The second largest
     program addresses value chain development and private sector investment. With the increasing focus of
     government on the private sector, this program has received significant additional funding in recent years.
     The research and institutional development programs are funded at far lower levels.


                                                                44
107.     It is important to consider budget execution rates, especially in the current context of rapidly
increasing budgets in agriculture. MINAGRI’s budget execution rates are consistently high, with rates
close to 100 percent for RAB and NAEB. Execution rates are significantly higher for MINAGRI’s central
budget, reflecting high expenditure by the large internal and donor-funded projects managed from the
center. Good performance on these projects means that they consistently spend more than their initial
budgets for the year, resulting in MINECOFIN providing additional funds during the budget revision in
the later part of the fiscal year.

the indicative financing plan, were summarized and presented in paras. 16 – 22 (and associated Tables 2 -
4).

109.     In summary, the ASIP program structure and expenditure levels build on the structure and
expenditure trends during the PSTA 2 period and recent budgetary allocations and projections, while
reflecting enhancements in the program structure, content, and increased expenditures to achieve PSTA
3’s targets (medium-cost scenario). This pattern also reflects the recent increases in budgetary allocations
to MINAGRI, which are expected to be sustained in the medium term. Further details on the expenditure
framework for PSTA 3 are presented in Annex 6.


Part D. Description and Assessment of Program Results Framework and M&E

110.    During the initial identification mission of the PforR operation, the Bank team worked
closely with and supported MINAGRI’s PSTA 3 team to prepare a comprehensive and summary
RF, underpinned by an explicit results chain specified at three levels, measured by “SMART” indicators,
with their corresponding baselines and targets: impact level for the overall PSTA 3 (and medium-cost
scenario); outcome level for each of the four programs; and outcomes and output levels for each of the 24
SPs (see PforR file for the copy of PSTA 3’s RF). Once the targets for all outputs were costed, there was
an excessive financing gap for the “high-cost scenario”; this led to a reduction in the targets for various
outputs based on the consistent application of five prioritization criteria to develop a “medium-cost
scenario.” There were several iterations of PSTA 3’s RF, resulting in enhanced capacity and strong
ownership by key MINAGRI counterparts. Based on this PSTA 3 RF, the Bank team derived a modified
version of the RF for purposes of the Ag. PforR support operation, in line with the PforR RF template.


                                                         45
111.     The team also supported the formulation of the strategic objective (SO) as outlined in the
RF for SP 4.4 to strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness, access to, and utilization of an enhanced MIS
for the agriculture sector that would contribute to enhanced evidenced-based decision making. This SO is
highly relevant for supporting the effective implementation and governance of PSTA 3, with support from
the PforR operation.

112.     The Bank team’s review of MINAGRI’s current M&E system 50 identified and consolidated
the main constraints, which were: i) there is no unified system in place to link the various
institutions/organizations performing M&E in the agriculture sector. Each of the institutions/organizations
focus on input/output indicators as specified in their performance contracts and not relating to PSTA 3; ii)
MINAGRI functions to a certain extent as lead agency for M&E operations but does not link them to
PSTA 3 as of yet. Neither does it cover the level of strategic objectives, but instead remains at an
operational level; iii) the formats used are not harmonized and are oversimplified, so questions arise as to
the validity and reliability of the collected data; and iv) M&E at all agricultural institutions suffers from
shortages of adequately trained personnel as well as of budgetary means.

113.    At the subnational level, The M&E assessment highlighted an additional set of constraints
at the District and sectoral levels, which included: i) a focus on the priorities determined at a higher
level (national and District); ii) some reliability issues in the way that crop production/productivity
harvest data are generated and reported; and iii) the diverse reporting formats used at various levels,
which pose additional challenges to the reliable aggregation of production data.

114.     In the light of the above assessment, the PforR operation includes a framework for updating
and consolidating an action plan for strengthening the M&E system for MINAGRI, in a manner
which is integrated and supportive of the M&E systems for each of MINAGRI’s entities (RAB, NAEB,
the three SPIUs), while taking a sectoral approach, in line with the RF for PSTA 3.


Part E. Program Economic Evaluation

115.     This section presents the economic assessment of the Ag. PforR support operation for PSTA
3. The rational for public sector financing as well as the World Bank value added are presented, followed
by a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the ASIP. Results are also presented to inform the relative
prioritization of the different SPs in the ASIP medium-cost scenario totaling US$1,195 million over five
years in constant 2014 prices (equivalent to US$1,214 million with inflation and projected changes in
RwF/US$ exchange rates).

116.    Public sector rationale. The rationale for public sector investments includes that cash-poor
farmers are unable to cover large unit development costs combined with long-term and downstream
benefits that provide inclusionary access to expected benefits by beneficiaries. In the case of irrigation
and service delivery, plans include subsequent transfer of ownership and service provision to private
sector entities. Public sector intervention is also justified in key post-harvest and off-farm investments
that create spillover inclusionary effects but that have been delayed because of a lack of private sector
financing.



50
   Also, a recent assessment of the M&E system in support of preparing the evaluation framework of PSTA 3 identified system-
related constraints which are included in the World Bank’s assessment (see M&E Framework and ASIP for PSTA 3:
Intermediate Final Report (May, 2014), prepared by EU-funded consultants).

                                                             46
117.    World Bank added value. World Bank financing in support of the PSTA 3 program would add
comparative value given the World Bank’s position to draw upon and help contextualize to Rwandan
conditions a wealth of global experience in areas directly related to program investment areas.
Achievements and lessons from the successful implementation of ongoing World Bank-supported
operations in the sector also provide a strong background upon which to prepare and support the effective
implementation of this proposed operation.

118.    A 25-year cash flow model is used to assess the ex-ante productivity, effectiveness, and
efficiency of public sector investments.51 While the costs of all SPs are included in the analysis, the
model only quantifies direct benefits for 9 of the 24 SPs, covering 88 percent of the public sector
investment. It is assumed that the private sector and PPP investments mapped out in the ASIP costs will
occur and be economically viable. The core of the analytical model estimates the impact of SP
investments on revenues and costs in seven different enterprise models: three cropping models, one
livestock model, and three post-harvest enterprises. In addition, the analysis quantifies increased benefits
from greater employment opportunities in agriculture, and an estimate of the economic value of increased
carbon sequestration.

119.     A selection of key drivers of agricultural growth is quantified in the model to analyze the
impact of changes in public sector investment costs by linking enterprise models and SP costs.
Changes in public sector investments lead to changes in: the number of developed hectares with terracing
or irrigation; the number of higher-yielding cows distributed; the number of infrastructures built for post-
harvest drying and storage; and the extent of new or improved feeder roads. Further to this, the model
captures how SPs are designed to enhance farm-level yields and affect fertilizer and seed use. The
linkages between enterprise models and SP investments also capture benefits from reduced soil erosion,
labor savings from mechanization, cost savings from feeder roads, avoided yield, and price loss from
post-harvest infrastructure, and adoption of new farming practices.

120.    The medium-cost scenario yields an economic net present value (NPV) of US$585 million
and a sound economic rate of return (ERR) of 21 percent. Undiscounted, this is equivalent to an
average annual economic net benefit of US$195 million. Using this estimate as a proxy for annual growth
in the agriculture sector, it constitutes 8.0 percent of the agricultural share of GDP, nearly matching the
8.5 percent growth target in PSTA 3. Some benefits are not yet captured in this analysis, including
incremental benefits from value chain development.

121.     Poverty reduction is achieved through increased farm income and employment generation.
Poverty reduction is achieved through increased farm-level incomes ranging between US$320 and
US$2,200 per year on a 0.6 ha farm. Assuming five people per farm household, this constitutes about 0.3
to 2.3 times the national poverty line or US$0.20-1.20 per person per day. Poverty is also reduced by
generating agricultural employment in the order of 7.7 million work days per year or 29,400 fulltime
person-years.

122.     Elasticities indicate the relative impact of different SPs. An analysis of elasticities indicates
that the economic NPV is most sensitive to changes in investments in land conservation, research and
technology transfer, and soil fertility investments. Conversely, estimated elasticities indicate that the
impact on employment generation is driven particularly by investments in livestock development and
irrigation, while employment decreases with increased mechanization.


51
  Financial prices are converted to economic prices using adjustment factors and amounts are noted in constant 2014 terms; the
exchange rate is RwF 650 to 1 US$.

                                                              47
123.    Linkages between enterprise models and SPs highlight that there are positive synergies. In
the case of soil conservation and livestock production, increased income and availability of fodder and
straw enable livestock production while available manure helps improve incomes and soil fertility. The
net benefit from investments in storage facilities is dependent on successful implementation of SPs that
increase crop yields and prices. Program delay and low farmer adoption rates are key risk factors that can
threaten the achievement of expected benefits. Risk management strategies should ensure minimum
program delay while also increasing farmer adoption rates through extension. Finally, it is important that
yield increases are supported through SPs for livestock and hillside developments because these
enterprises constitute a large share of total program returns.

124.    Agriculture growth driven by the nine quantified SPs is enabled through linkages to the
other SPs. First, support for farmers' organizations helps improve access to inputs, markets, finance,
insurance, and extension services. Based on this, benefits can be captured in cropping and livestock
production because these require functioning markets for both farm inputs and outputs. Second, the
enterprise models rely on access to markets via value chains for crops, dairy, and meat including for
increased production of cash crops and export. This requires access to improved drying, storage,
processing, and also transport, which are necessary to meet higher quality standards and to sell perishable
products to other than local markets.

125.     Effective institutions, adapted legal and regulatory frameworks, and targeting of
disadvantaged groups strengthen program impact. The impacts of investment in research, technology
transfer, and extension rely on effective institutions that can implement research programs and ensure
farmer adoption of improved technologies and farming practices. In addition, investments are planned to
adapt the legal and regulatory system to transform the agriculture sector toward higher value chains
including exports. Finally, because investments that increase productivity may be subject to elite capture,
SP investments are planned to ensure that disadvantaged groups benefit through food and nutrition
security as well as through employment generation.

126.    Tracking impacts against a baseline with reliable M&E systems helps decision makers and
DPs make evidence-based investment decisions. To ensure that the program investment is sound and
stays on target, it is important to track impacts against a baseline. Investments are needed to establish the
baseline against which impacts are measured, but also to assess if investment priorities should change
over time as new information comes to light. By establishing a statistical system and a targeted M&E
system, it becomes possible to implement sound investments in the future based on timely and reliable
information.


Part F. Inputs to the Program Action Plan

127.    The technical, fiduciary, and environmental and social systems assessments highlighted five
main types of cross-cutting risks and where the resulting key actions and risk mitigation measures
form the basis of the PAP. While the overall PSTA 3 is sound, these additional actions will facilitate
smooth implementation and meet and contribute to international good practice. The main areas of cross-
cutting risks and mitigation measures to be supported during implementation for the overall PAP are
summarized below (see detailed PAP framework in Table 15).

128.    Enhanced enabling policy environment and expanded private sector role and capacities
refers to: the relatively infant stage of development and maturity of the private sector in the
agriculture sector; the absence of clear and sound policies and supporting mechanisms to stimulate
an expanded private sector role in input and output markets; and the relatively weak capacities of

                                                     48
farmers’ cooperatives/organizations. Accordingly, proposed actions to enhance required capacities and
performance, as well as risk mitigation measures to be a part of the PAP includes preparing and
implementing well-focused and updated strategies of RAB and NAEB to enhance an enabling
environment for an expanded private sector through better pinpointing of binding constraints involving
policy, institutional, and investment aspects.

129.     Evolving public sector institutional roles and enhanced capacities refers to important
changes at central and subnational levels as part of the government’s overall decentralization
strategy, whereby MINAGRI agencies (RAB and NAEB) are currently completing strategic plans
and undergoing restructuring, with an expanded field presence to support Districts’ expanded role,
to ensure greater efficiencies and effectiveness. Accordingly, key actions and risk mitigation measures
to be a part of the PAP include: i) ensuring these reforms/strategic plans for RAB and NAEB are
completed expeditiously (during 2014, they already well advanced) and effectively implemented; and ii)
integrating the three SPIUs in MINAGRI’s overall structure to foster enhanced capacities and
sustainability of strategic activities at various levels, while retaining the strengths of the SPIUs in
effective execution.

130.    Operation and maintenance challenges and requirements refers to the challenges of
ensuring that the significant expansion of productive rural infrastructure is well maintained and
based on efficient and sustainable arrangements (especially soil and land conservation works,
irrigation facilities, and rural roads); many farmers’ cooperatives and organizations are young,
with emerging capacities to ensure the required and timely O&M support, especially given the
“public good” nature of this infrastructure, which warrants organized collective action.
Accordingly, key actions and risk mitigation measures to be a part of the PAP include: i) implementing
O&M arrangements and mechanisms for each of the infrastructure investments (e.g., IWUOs;
cooperatives/farmers’ groups; road maintenance brigades) and confirming they are operational and
functional, including explicit and timely hand-over arrangements with beneficiaries (e.g., Irrigation
Transfer Management Agreements for irrigation schemes); and ii) conducting well-focused capacity
development/training activities of the various farmer-level organizational structures to help ensure
adequate and timely O&M (IWUOs, farmers’ organizations/cooperatives, road maintenance brigades).

131.     Overall, the fiduciary aspects of the relevant implementation agencies are sound, although
some modest weaknesses, especially at the District level, need strengthening, considering the
increasing proportion of funds being channeled through and accounted for by Districts. More
specifically, the fiduciary assessment highlighted the following aspects that need relatively minor
strengthening and appropriate mitigation measures to ensure robust fiduciary accountability at all levels
and times: expenditure variance analysis; internal controls; internal audits; external audit; implementation
of the public procurement law, regulations, and procedures; and fraud and corruption (F&C) aspects,
especially at the District level. Accordingly, the key actions to be a part of the PAP include the following:
i) MINAGRI, with support from its SPIUs, and in collaboration with MINALOC, and based on a
“representative” sample of Districts, to prepare an operational action plan to strengthen relevant fiduciary
aspects, with an emphasis on District-level capacities in the following areas: procurement; internal
controls; internal audit; external audit accountability at the District level; more effective and consistent
implementation of the procurement law, regulations, and procedures; F&C strengthening at the District
level; and ii) implement the agreed fiduciary, environmental, and social systems actions.

132.    Agriculture expenditure and financing framework. There is a need to further strengthen
the agriculture planning and budgetary allocation system, coupled with an enhanced MIS to ensure
adequate and prioritized levels of funding PSTA 3. An improved planning and budgetary process has been
in place since 2013/14 and TA support (from USAID, EU, and IFAD) to MINAGRI will provide further
improvements. MINAGRI and MINECOFIN will work closely to strengthen the planning process. In addition, there

                                                     49
will be intensified government-DP dialogue as part of the annual budgetary cycle in support of the PSTA 3
requirements.

                                       Table 15: Summary of the PAP
Area 1: Enhanced enabling policy environment and expanded private sector role and capacities
- Prepare and implement well-focused and updated policies and strategies of RAB and NAEB, including gender
mainstreaming and incorporation of nutrition. TA support from USAID, DFID, IFAD and EU are addressing
these issues.
- Prepare a position paper on strategic PPPs to pursue in the sector.
Area 2: Evolving public sector institutional roles and enhanced capacities
- Ensure the reforms/strategic plans of RAB and NAEB are completed and implemented, including appropriate
integration with the ongoing restructuring.
- Complete integration of independent SPIUs into RAB, NAEB structure (and support implementation of action
plan for smooth transition, integration, and capacity development). TA is being provided by the EU, USAID,
IFAD, FAO and DFID to strengthen the evolving public sector roles and enhanced capacities at central and
District levels, as well as an inclusive private sector.
- Prepare and implement a capacity development plan for decentralized reforms/restructuring
Area 3: Operation and maintenance challenges and requirements
-Implement and strengthen a monitoring scheme to confirm rural infrastructural investments have appropriate
O&M arrangements and mechanisms in place and monitor implementation of O&M measures.
- Implement O&M monitoring system to monitor O&M of major rural infrastructure (as part of the enhanced MIS
for agric. sector).
- Conduct well-focused capacity development/training activities of farmer-level organizational structures on
O&M mechanisms. The ongoing World Bank-financed projects (LWH and RSSP 3 series) include support for
addressing these O&M challenges.
Area 4: Fiduciary, environmental, and social systems
-MINAGRI, in collaboration with key actors, prepare an operational action plan to address and strengthen
relevant fiduciary aspects, including fraud and corruption, with an emphasis on District-level capacities.
- Provide on-the-job training to District accounting staff focusing on the consolidation of nonbudget agencies at
the District level.
- Provide on-the-job training to OM and NPPA investigators.
- Develop and implement a communications strategy to sensitize stakeholders about the Program and complaints
mechanism.
- Develop and maintain a database of complaints and responses (MINAGRI).
- Assess the risk-prone areas of the program at the District level and develop a risk profile to be monitored
through the program life ensuring that timely mitigation measures are undertaken.
- Reconcile the accounting/financial statements before and after the merger of both RAB and NAEB.
- Implement the agreed fiduciary actions, including fraud and corruption systems.
- In collaboration with participating ministries and agencies, develop a consolidated Environmental and Social
Implementation Manual based on existing government guidelines; and conduct training on the understanding and
application of this Manual at the national and District level.
Area 5: Ag. expenditure and financing framework
 -MINAGRI will work closely with MINECOFIN to strengthen the agriculture public expenditure planning and
budgetary allocation system, coupled with an enhanced MIS, to ensure adequate and prioritized levels of funding
to PSTA 3. An improved planning and budgetary process has been in place since 2013/14 and TA support (from
USAID, EU, and IFAD) to MINAGRI will provide further improvements. In addition, there will be intensified
government-DP dialogue as part of the annual budgetary cycle in support of the PSTA 3 requirements.



Part G. Technical Risk Rating

133.   Based on the technical assessment findings, and considering the proposed risk mitigation,
improvement, and capacity development measures summarized above (with further details outlined in


                                                        50
Annexes 4 and 9), the overall risk rating for the technical assessment is “Moderate.” This rating
reflects both the cross-cutting risks involving the overall PSTA 3 program and the challenges of efficient
and effective implementation of the large number of SPs (24), which involve promoting strategic policy,
institutional, and investment reforms/enhancements in the sector; at the same time, these SPs support the
achievement of ambitious but attainable strategic objectives and targets for each of the SPs, as well as
generate synergies within and between the four programs of PSTA 3, working together to generate
higher-level impacts. The detailed PSTA 3 RF provides important details on the nature of the identified
constraints and the explicit results chain (from inputs-to-outputs-to-outcomes, all contributing to the
higher-level impacts) for achieving the strategic objectives of each SP and the overall PSTA 3. The
results chain and design of the RF were intended to address the identified risk factors. Annex 9 provides
further details on the nature of the constraints and related risks for each SP, and the basis of the risk rating
for each SP. Table 16 summarizes the risk ratings for each of the SPs, which form a core component of
the overall risk rating.

134.     Paragraphs 126-131 highlight the risk mitigation measures that address the four major cross-
cutting risk themes. Paragraphs 43-53 summarize the main design features of each of the SPs, including
those aspects that address the identified risks. Annex 9 provides further details on the nature and scope of
risks.

Part H. Inputs to the Program Implementation Support Plan

135.     The PforR operation in Rwanda will require considerable well-coordinated and sharply
focused technical support from the Bank’s interdisciplinary team, particularly during the early
stages of implementation. One challenge will be to coordinate and align the actions agreed in the PAP
with operational activities on the ground, ensuring that information flows effectively and on a timely basis
between policy makers and implementation actors (MINECOFIN, MINAGRI, RAB, NAEB, SPIUs, and
Districts). While channels of communication are generally good within Rwanda, there will be a continual
flow of information to and between implementing entities and the relevant officials/counterparts during
the Program, and linking them to the RF of PSTA 3 and of the Program, and to the DLIs. At the District
level, implementation actors will need to confirm with the Bank that their budgetary planning is
technically sound and timely to ensure that available funding can be absorbed and expected results
delivered on time, and within expected budget envelopes. The team recognizes that the Ag. PforR mode
of operation, which transfers performance risk to the implementing actors, provides a challenge,
particularly at the local level. The fact that the World Bank Group’s Ag. PforR program is highly
decentralized, with task team leader and key team members based in the region, will facilitate overall
implementation and timely communication with and support to the client (and its various actors), and the
diverse stakeholders involved in the implementation phase.

136.     The Bank’s implementation support will be focused on making the results -based incentive
system work to its full potential. This will include: i) reviewing implementation progress, including the
PAP and any required changes, and solid and timely achievement of Program results and DLIs; ii)
providing support on resolving emerging Program implementation issues and bottlenecks and on building
institutional capacity of the key actors in line with the PAP (which also addresses the various risks
outlined in Annex 4); iii) monitoring the adequacy of systems’ performance, especially including the PAP
and any required updating, and monitoring compliance with legal agreements; and iv) supporting the GoR
in monitoring and managing changes in the various types of risks (as outlined in Annex 4), as well as
compliance with the provisions of the legal covenants.

137.     Key to the Bank’s effective implementation support will be the coordination and timing
with critical points in the planning and verification of results for disbursement requests to the
World Bank, based on the agreed DLIs. The first implementation support mission will take place
shortly following effectiveness to provide direct and timely feedback on the quality of implementation
plans. It is expected that at that stage, initial progress will have been made towards many of the actions in
the PAP and these will also be reviewed during the initial review mission. The first mission is therefore
expected to include all team members (i.e., technical, environmental, social, and fiduciary team
members). Subsequent implementation support will have a stronger emphasis on verification/M&E skills
and technical implementation expertise, varying according to the actual needs as specified in the PAP and
priority requests by MINAGRI.

138.   Further details on the focus of the Bank’s implementation support and the Bank’s task team skills
mix requirements for implementation support are provided in Annex 10.

                          Annex 1: Key Accomplishments of PSTA 2 (2008-2012)52

1.         During the PSTA 2/Rwanda CAADP 1 five-year implementation period, the agriculture
sector was responsible for over 50 percent of the total poverty reduction of 12 percentage points.
This was driven by increased production (productivity gains) and increased sales of production.
Interventions that drove productivity gains (yield increases by up to 7 times and an average of 4 times
across many crops) included implementation of the Land Use Consolidation policy, protection against
soil erosion, increased area under irrigation, greater access to agricultural finance, improved advisory
services, expansion of input distribution networks, and increased use of compost, agrochemicals, and
improved seeds inputs, increased market accessibility, improved marketing and product quality, and
increased post-harvest infrastructure.53

2.         Quantitative objectives and accomplishments of PSTA 2/CAADP 1 were measured using
23 specific performance indicators. Three main groupings of performance indicators, comparing
established baselines and targets, measured: i) sector macro performance; ii) land intensification,
improved inputs and irrigated land; and iii) livestock, food, and export crop performance.

Sector macro performance

3.         The first grouping of performance indicators for PSTA 2/CAADP 1, which measured the
sector’s macro performance, saw an agriculture sector GDP growth average of 5.6 percent in 2012,
with agricultural investment as a percentage of GDP at 22.5 percent. Off-farm employment as a share of
total employment was 26.6 percent, the reduction in the share of the rural population living in poverty
was 49 percent, and the share of the population falling below the minimum food requirement was 21
percent. Finally, the share of female-headed households members living in poverty declined to 47 percent,
and the annual rate of agriculture exports averaged 22 percent (see Table A1.1).

4.          Agriculture GDP. The real GDP for the agriculture sector grew at an average annual rate of
5.6 percent during 2008-2012, contributing to 32.7 percent of GDP and 28 percent of total growth. This
relatively high average rate of growth, just below the target 6.5 percent, was the result of expansion of
food production due to scaled-up public investments in the Crop Intensification Program (CIP), Land Use
Consolidation Program, input subsidies on fertilizers and seeds, and other public activities to promote
production of priority crops. Although expansion of the traditional export crops such as coffee and tea

53
   This led to a reduction in post-harvest losses to less than 15 percent of production.

                                                           53
was less than planned, the growth of milk production was strong, in large part because of the One-Cow
(Girinka) Program.

5.          Gross capital formation for the economy as a whole stood at 22.5 percent of GDP in 2012,
while the target was set at 23 percent. This was after a steady rise in this ratio from the year 2000, and
reflected the government’s policy to invest heavily in the economy to induce an increase in private
investment. Public investment scaled up to 12.8 percent of GDP, inducing an expansion of private
investment to 9.7 percent of GDP. However, this did not leverage an increase in foreign direct investment
(FDI).

6.           Off-farm employment. The actual share of off-farm employment both for wages and self-
employment was 26.6 percent in 2011.54 Although off-farm employment as a share of total employment
fell short of the target of 30 percent, this employment increased at a rate of about 100,000 jobs a year over
the past five years. Demographic trends, however, necessitate the creation of 200,000 jobs each year to
accommodate all new entrants into the workforce. This compares to a total of 396,000 wage jobs in the
formal economy in 2012.

7.          Rural poverty. The reduction of the share of the rural population living in poverty exceeded
the target of 52 percent, falling to 49 percent. This was primarily due to three factors: i) increased
agricultural production; ii) increased commercialization of agriculture as a response to the policy of
promoting maize, wheat, and rice as cash crops; and iii) income-generating activities in the nonfarm
sector, a response to declining opportunities in agriculture for those with limited land holdings and low
wages available to the poor in the nonfarm sector.55

8.         Minimum food requirement. The share of the population falling below the minimum food
requirement was reduced to 21 percent, slightly above the target of 18 percent. This statistic comes from
the 2012 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis and Nutrition Survey that is sensitive
to seasonal timing, so it is probable that a year-long survey might have shown a higher percentage of
households with acceptable food consumption.56 The survey is also influenced by year-to-year variations
in food production and income, with 2012 being a particularly low year in production due to weather
extremes. The policy of promoting maize, wheat, and rice did not encourage production of food crops
such as bananas, beans, and cassava for the food insecure.

9.          Share of female-headed household members living in poverty. According to Enquête
Intégralesur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages (Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey/EICV
3), the share of female-headed household members living in poverty declined to 47 percent, below the
target of 48 percent. This was due to the fact that the consumption standard of the poorest households, in
which women-headed households are disproportionately represented, gained more in percentage terms
than that of any other group.57

10.        Growth rate of agriculture exports. The annual rate of growth from 2007 to 2012 of the
value of agricultural and livestock exports was 22 percent. The most important increases occurred for live
bovine animals, wheat flour, and beverages. Although the share of processed products in total agricultural
and livestock exports was only 26 percent in 2012, processed exports grew at an annual rate of 53 percent

product exports was 17 percent, still a very respectable rate.

Land intensification, inputs and irrigated land performance

11.          In the second grouping of performance indicators, between 2008-2012, the area protected
against soil erosion rose to 73 percent; land protected by trenching and terraces increased by 46,246 ha
of newly constructed terraces; 23,000 ha of marshlands were developed; hillside irrigated land increased
by 2,490 ha; and land area under consolidated use increased from 28,788 to 502,916 ha. Use of inorganic
fertilizer increased from 12 percent to 29 percent and fertilizer imports increased from 29,900 MT to
44,000 MT (see Table A1.2).

Source: As given in accompanying text.

12.        Area protected against soil erosion. The percentage of coverage and effectiveness of soil
conservation infrastructure increased from 600,000 ha to 1,095,914 ha out of total cultivable area of 1.5
million ha, for a total of 73 percent coverage. While the target was 100 percent, the achievement of
almost doubling the coverage of area protected against soil erosion is impressive. This was driven by the
CIP and externally financed projects that included a soil conservation focus.

13.        Land protected by trenches and progressive terraces. Land management, including
progressive terracing where this could be applied and was needed, was improved on approximately
300,000 ha. This increased from 504,000 ha to 802,292 ha. Much of this land had already been terraced
prior to PSTA 2, but these terraces and trenches were in need of maintenance and some improvement.
The government at both the federal and local levels spearheaded this effort.

14.         Hectares of newly constructed terraces. As a major component of the CIP and Land Use
Consolidation Program, the area of land developed with bench/radical terraces attained 46,246 ha in 2012,
substantially exceeding the target of 32,000 ha. This form of land protection is more costly than
progressive terracing since it involves removing the topsoil, cutting into the hillside, and returning the
topsoil and other interventions to restore and improve soil fertility. Since this type of work is done
manually, it has the advantage of employing a significant amount of labor. Even though the employment
is temporary, it injects substantial cash resources into the rural economy, which was shown to be used to
purchase livestock or equipment and to invest in nonagricultural activities. Furthermore, the economic
cost of this labor is less than the wages actually paid since the workers hired had few alternative
opportunities.

15.        Area of developed marshland increased. Development of marshlands was a major element
in the government’s effort to expand rice production and increase food security. The area under irrigation
in the marshlands increased to 23,000 ha, well above the target of 20,000 ha. Although the cost of

                                                      55
marshland development for irrigation (US$6,000-$8,000 per/ha) is much lower than the cost of
developing irrigation on many of the hillsides (up to US$23,000 per/ha), marshland development costs
are rising as the easiest, lowest-cost locations are being developed. However, these costs are to a large
extent borne by the government in cooperation with DPs. The marshland rice development program is
very popular with farmers, having provided cash income to about 150,000 farm households.

16.         Hillside irrigation was developed during PSTA 2 on 2,490 ha compared with the target of
13,000 ha. A major reason for this gap was its high cost of up to US$23,000 per ha. This compares with
the cost of small-scale irrigation schemes of about US$1,500. Cost recovery requires high-value
horticultural or other high-income crops.

17.         Land area under consolidated use. Although no explicit target was established for increased
land area put under consolidated use, it was an important focus of the CIP by improving the efficiency of
land use and facilitating extension. Actual results were significant. From 28,788 ha of total area under
consolidated use in 2007, it rose to 502,916 ha in 2012. Although farmers had some reservations in the
beginning, most became willing converts once the benefits were established of achieving economies of
scale in securing inputs and marketing production.

18.         Application of fertilizer. The percentage of farmers who reported having purchased fertilizers
increased from 7 percent in 2001 (12 percent in 2008) to 30 percent in 2011 compared with the target rate
of 25 percent. More specifically, the fertilizer application rate in CIP areas reached an annual average of
29 kg/ha in 2012 compared to a national average of 4.2 kg/ha during 1998-2005. Such increases were due
partly to the 50 percent subsidy policy on fertilizer applied to maize and wheat, as well as the transport
subsidy on fertilizer for rice and potatoes. As a result, average maize yields increased from 0.73 MT/ha in
2007 to 2.76 MT/ha in 2012, while wheat yields increased from 1.30 MT/ha to 2.17 MT/ha during the
same period.

19.         Fertilizer imports. Use of imported mineral fertilizers rose to 44,000 MT in 2012, compared
with the national target of 56,000 MT. The shortfall was principally due to challenges of cost and credit
recovery along the whole supply chain from distributor to farmer. Providing direct subsidies for fertilizer
used in the production of maize and wheat and subsidizing the international transport of fertilizer from
Mombasa or Dar es Salaam for rice and Irish potatoes proved to be expensive and there were difficulties
in the printing and distributing of subsidy vouchers and monitoring their use. There was also a lack of
profitability in the distribution chain, which resulted in high default rates on fertilizer loans among
farmers and agro-dealers.

Livestock, food and export crop performance

20.         The third grouping of performance indicators for PSTA 2/CAADP 1 included: a food
crop production increase to 24 percent; households with livestock decrease by 3 percent; increase in
number of households participating in the One-Cow Program to 174,900; fully-washed coffee production
increase to 29 percent from 10 percent; increase in coffee exports from 18,200 MT to 19,907 MT; green
leaf tea exports increase to 19,000 MT from 23,011 MT; pyrethrum exports increase from 2.2 MT to 28.1
MT; horticulture exports increase from 13,700 MT to 27,822 MT; and continued limited capacity to
collect and disseminate accurate agriculture statistics (see Table A1.3).

Source: As given in accompanying text.

21.        Value of food crop production. According to the national accounts, the value of food crop
production in constant prices rose by 24 percent from 2008 to 2012.58 This substantially exceeded the
target and was due principally to the success of the CIP and Land Use Consolidation policies.

22.        Rural households’ livestock increases. Based on EICV 3 data, the percentage of rural
households raising livestock actually declined to 68 percent, substantially below the target of 85 percent
and even lower than the percentage in 2005/2006 of 71 percent.59 This was because of growing population
pressure and lack of pasture, forage, and feed in competition with food crops. However, even though the
percentage of households holding livestock was lower, more of these animals were marketed, and more
inputs were purchased for them than before, marking a shift towards greater intensity of care and
livestock productivity. With rising incomes, there has been considerable scope on the demand side for
expanding production of small ruminants, swine, and poultry, and their related processing industries.

23.        The One-Cow (Girinka) Program was highly successful in raising rural household incomes
and in increasing milk production and consumption. Since the beginning of the program in 2006, a total
of 134,548 cows had been distributed to poor families and 40,352 heifers (for a total of 174,900) had been
“passed on to other families by mid-2012.” Although this was below the target set of 270,000, it was
nonetheless a significant accomplishment. The principal reason for not meeting the target was that the
budget needed to distribute an additional 95,000 cows was not available and had been overtaken by other
budget priorities such as the CIP. Despite this fact, milk production increased from 50,000 MT in 2000 to
450,000 MT in 2012 and the corresponding “One Cup of Milk per Child” school feeding program
contributed to improved nutrition. The success of these programs was due to widespread support from the
government, DPs, NGOs, local government, and private citizens.

24.         Fully-washed coffee. Fully-washed coffee increased from 10 percent to 29 percent. While a
positive increase, the target of 37 percent was not achieved. Increasing fully-washed coffee is important
because fully-washed Arabica coffee commands a premium on the world market. The major reason for
not achieving the 37 percent target was that many existing washing stations have too much capacity to be
profitable given the dispersion of coffee production and high transport costs along Rwanda’s feeder roads.
However, positive steps are being taken to resolve this issue as the coffee-washing sector is being
reshaped by the introduction of smaller, more profitable washing stations.

25.        Coffee exports. Another challenge in the coffee subsector was the low level of production and
exports – 19,907 MT in 2012 compared with the target of 40,000 MT. This was primarily because of low
prices on the world market, which is subject to substantial fluctuation in price. When prices are low,

coffee farmers do not maintain their trees and are less careful in harvesting. When prices rebound, coffee
collection increases. There are also problems with the aging of coffee trees, failure to replant, and poor
management.

26.         Green leaf tea exports. Tea exports of 23,011 MT in 2012 were far below the target of
123,000 MT. The Rwandan tea industry until recently was characterized by poor management. However,
that situation is changing as the industry is being reorganized, with tea exports expected to grow more
rapidly in the future. Tea factory owners are also aware of the need to have good relationships with the
outgrowers, especially regarding the setting of prices. Increasing tea sales and income depend upon
improving quality and marketing to move up the value scale. Bulk black tea prices are projected to
decline, but the opposite trend is expected for quality teas, for which Rwanda has significant potential.
Other favorable factors for the domestic tea industry include the fact that while major world producers are
constrained by land and labor shortages, tea consumption in Africa is growing, and Rwanda is well placed
to access key markets under European Partnership Agreements (EPAs), the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA), EAC, and other agreements.

27.          Pyrethrum exports. Pyrethrum exports reached 28.1 MT annually in 2012. Few data are
available publicly on the pyrethrum industry. NISR has no information from Customs on exports over the
past five years. The industry appears promising, especially if it can be integrated in rotation with
production of Irish potatoes, but further analysis is needed once basic data can be secured. The capacity of
the extraction plant is 3,000 MT of dried flowers annually, of which only about one-half was used during
the last five years. Pyrethrum appears to be a profitable export industry and the public sector has a role to
play in helping to persuade farmers and cooperatives to work with the factory in the cultivation of
pyrethrum and rotating it with Irish potatoes.

28.        Horticultural exports. Actual exports of horticultural products in 2012 were 27,822 MT,
exceeding the target of 25,600 MT. There is a great deal of interest in horticulture in Rwanda because the
climate and soils are ideal and minimal land is needed for production. The government has placed a high
priority on promoting horticultural investments and production through the Grow Africa initiative and
through three flagship programs co-financed by DPs. Success in horticultural exports was driven by
market expansion based on niche appeal and demand for high value added products and the promotion of
an integrated supply chain approach which focused on production and processing, transportation, and
direct marketing through dedicated contracting arrangements with external buyers, both within the region
and internationally.

Other key accomplishments of PSTA 2/ CAADP 1

29.        In addition to the achievements made against the 23 specific targets discussed above,
there were other key accomplishments which, for various reasons, were not reported on because
they were not easily linked to a specific target(s) or there were no data available to measure actual
accomplishments. For example, under PSTA 2, there were significant achievements related to improved
seeds and plant material, milk production, increased fish production and beekeeping, decentralization of
sector functions, and an increased “business-friendly environment” as discussed below.

30.         Improved seeds. The legal framework upon which the basic infrastructure for reinforcing
production and quality control and production of plant material and seeds is built significantly increased
during PSTA 2 implementation. However, there were insufficient quantities of improved seeds produced
nationally for some crops, which forced the government to import seeds, particularly for maize, wheat,
and Irish potatoes. The quality of internally produced seed was poor, and there was quality deterioration
during seed production and storage, with a prevalence of crop pests and diseases; germination of seeds
distributed under the CIP was inadequate, and effective distribution of improved seed was limited.

31.          Milk production. Although milk production expanded rapidly under PSTA 2, most of this
was raw, unpasteurized milk due, in part, to competition in the processed milk market from regional
neighbors with lower costs. The approach to milk collection supported by the GoR is sound, with milk
collection centers (MCC) managed by producers’ cooperatives and providing other livestock services,
such as advisory services, artificial insemination, veterinary medicinal products, and animal feeding.
However, it is estimated that only 10 percent of the milk is processed, and the country’s milk processing
plants were operating at only 15-20 percent of their capacity, and some MCC in the East have closed.
Although consumption of raw fresh milk by poor households is a good way to improve their nutritional
status, it is also posing some sanitary risks (brucellosis, tuberculosis) and the growing market for dairy
products in urban areas is putting pressure on the development of the processing industry.

32.         Fisheries sector. In the fisheries sector, demand outpaced production, with consequent
depletion of resources. It is estimated that about 27,000 MT were produced in 2013 (with 80 percent
capture fish and only 20 percent aquaculture), but that 70 percent of this production is informally
exported to neighboring countries, including DRC. At the same time, 15,000 MT were imported for
national consumption. Nevertheless, the sector has great potential and with improved management is
capable of growing sustainably and of producing regional exports. Fish are also a nutritious addition to
daily diets and the per capita consumption has an important growth potential, with only 2 kg/person/year
consumed.

33.        Beekeeping, while a small activity on the national scale, has been important for the
communities involved, representing a significant source of additional income for poor families with
marginal land for agriculture. It is estimated that about 70,000 households are engaged in beekeeping, 90
percent in a traditional manner. This was particularly true in forested areas in the Southwest. Processed
products (high quality honey, royal jelly, beeswax) have high value addition and demand is growing from
urban areas. The GoR is currently finalizing a new National Strategic Plan for this sector.

34.         The implementation of decentralization of functions greatly enhanced the capacity of
local governments to implement PSTA 2 despite varying staffing levels in Districts and financial
capabilities. District administrations are in close contact with cooperatives and farmers and have built up
knowledge of the Districts’ needs and opportunities for agricultural development. District staff also
facilitated the implementation of national projects and programs, acted as an interface, and promoted
farmer-oriented extension approaches.

35.         Business-friendly environment. Rwanda’s focus on creating an enabling business
environment for agribusiness investments during PSTA 2 is starting to pay off. Rwanda has the second
most business-friendly environment compared to its Africa competitors (Mauritius is first). 60 It was
recently ranked 32nd in the world. It offers less bureaucratic red-tape, easier access to credit, and lower tax
rates compared to its neighbors. The government is actively seeking private sector investment in the
country, particularly in the agriculture sector. The country’s political and macroeconomic stability,
compared to other countries in Africa, provides investors with confidence regarding country risk.
Furthermore, the government is committed to investment in infrastructure that will facilitate trade
originating from Rwanda, including increased air connectivity, improved road networks, a rail link with
coastal ports, and expansion of the electricity supply.

Lessons Learned from PSTA 2/CAADP 1 and Recommendations for PSTA 3/CAADP 2

36.         In addition to understanding how and what was achieved in PSTA 2/CAADP 1, it is
important to identify lessons learned and implications for PSTA 3. Many factors were responsible for
Rwanda’s rapid rate of economic growth, including the establishment of a good business -enabling
environment and well-directed public investments. It is vitally important that public investment be
sustained under PSTA 3 and that it be directed in ways that are most cost-effective in achieving the goals
of EDPRS 2 and Vision 2020. Moreover, efficiently directed public investment is critical to inducing
private investment along with a more focused approach to increase FDI. Key recommendations for PSTA
3 are to: develop a strategy for extreme poor rural farmers; expand the CIP and LUC Program; increase
nonfarm employment; enhance value addition of key commodities; increase soil conservation coverage
and selectivity in hillside irrigation schemes; expand livestock intensification; increase awareness of
horticulture opportunities; establish feeding limits for the One-Cow (Girinka) Program; expand coffee and
tea production; and increase the reliability of agricultural statistics.

37.          Develop a strategy for extreme poor. Under PSTA 2, both food production and food
marketing were substantially increased, thereby helping to drive poverty rates down. However, there are
still a large number of people in rural areas who continue to live in poverty and there is a need to develop
a strategy of crop and livestock intensification and diversification focused on the extreme poor. Relying
on secondary benefits in the form of increased demand for the goods and services supplied by small,
informal household businesses would be important. At the same time, Rwanda is making good progress in
reducing the number of malnourished, but further progress depends on targeting this group more carefully
with the food crops they consume.

38.         Expand the CIP and the LUC Program. The CIP and the LUC Program, along with
fertilizer and improved seeds subsidy programs and land development costs, were important in
contributing to the expansion of food crop production. The CIP and LUC Program need to be further
expanded to geographic areas not currently covered to induce greater participation by extremely poor
smallholder farmers and need to include a greater focus on food crops consumed particularly by poor
households. The current exit strategy for disengaging from the subsidy scheme for fertilizer and improved
seeds should be completed, as farmers have learned about and experienced the benefits of fertilizer and
improved seeds over the last five years. Moreover, completing the privatization of import and distribution
of fertilizer should be actively pursued by the government and carefully monitored to ensure that the
change in policy does not endanger the uptake rates of fertilizer and improved seeds. It is also important
to recognize that the reduction in poverty that occurred was not because the extreme poor participated
fully in both the CIP and the LUC Program. In fact, they participated less than others in proportion to
their numbers. Yet their participation may have helped them become more market oriented. Equally
important was their income from the sales of nonfarm goods and services. There were increased risks, in
fact, associated with dramatic changes in cropping patterns towards less familiar cash crops that were
exchanged for food in uncertain markets and for which there were significant transactions costs.

39.        Grow nonfarm employment. Although progress has been made in increasing the number of
off-farm jobs over the last five years, the rate of increase is not keeping up with the growth of the labor
force. Keeping the growing work force fully employed is going to require additional analysis of how
these jobs are created via value chain linkages and growth in overall income and demand. Specific
attention must be paid to the policies that can be adopted to encourage the most cost-effective expansion
of nonfarm employment.

40.        Expand market opportunities in key value chains. Rwanda has a dynamic and growing
export sector, but the share of processed products in total agricultural and livestock exports is relatively
small. The government should identify opportunities and promote actions that need to be taken by both

                                                    60
the public and private sectors in key value chains such as coffee, tea, and horticulture to expand market-
oriented growth. A joint public-private strategy should be developed and implemented under PSTA 3, in
cooperation with Rwanda’s neighboring countries, to formalize and expand cross -border trade without
introducing unnecessary barriers to trade. This strategy should involve improved transportation and
storage infrastructure, maintaining grades and standards for the most important products, and facilitating
customs and other clearances.

41.         Improve soil conservation coverage. During PSTA 2, the large increase in the area of land
protected against soil erosion was accomplished at relatively low cost. Protecting farm land with trenches
and progressive terraces (slopes of 40-60 percent) is a traditional practice that can be made more effective
with a modest amount of organization and technical assistance. Bench/radical terraces are more costly but
necessary where slopes are between 16-40 percent slope. The intensive labor necessary to construct
radical terraces becomes an important means of injecting cash into the local economy. However,
development of marshlands for rice and high value crops is increasing in cost as the low-cost marshlands
have either been developed or redeveloped. At some point in the near to medium term, the cost of the
expansion of these systems will exceed the benefits.

42.         Selective hillside irrigation schemes. Hillside irrigation can be an expensive form of
infrastructure. Economic and financial analysis for each scheme should justify the investment and cost per
beneficiary as compared to other sectoral investments. It is most likely that only high-value crops will
justify the high level of investment.

43.        Increase livestock intensification. Higher levels of use of crop residues, agricultural
byproducts, and feed mixes are vital to intensification and expansion of the livestock sector, given the
shortage of land available for pasture or forage.

44.          Raise awareness of horticulture subsector opportunities. Horticulture has the potential to
significantly expand as an export industry. Markets and production potential for specific crops need to be
identified, their economics studied, and the results made available to potential private investors.

45.         Establish feeding limits for the Girinka Program. The One-Cow (Girinka) Program has
been a success in terms of the number of dairy cows distributed, but it has not benefitted the poor as much
as expected because of their lack of access to pasture and feed. An estimate should be made on the total
number of cows that can be supported with available crop residues, byproducts, forage, and pasture and a
limit of additional heifers to be distributed set accordingly. It will also be important that PSTA 3 contains
measures to establish local redistribution systems that ensure that the majority of Girinka milk is
consumed by nearby households and in local schools rather than distributed through a high-cost
centralized school milk program.

46.         Address nutrition and household vulnerability. A multisectoral framework of integrated
interventions is required to tackle problems of malnutrition and household vulnerability, including
supporting households in nutritious garden practices and diversifying food production, improving
nutrition-related knowledge and practices, developing a program of biofortified food, expanding the “One
Cup of Milk per Child” program, maintaining the National Strategic Food Reserve, and strengthening
Rwanda’s Food Security Information System.

47.         Expand coffee and tea production. Coffee and tea are valuable export crops. More
investment is needed to increase the number of smaller washing stations, take greater care of plants in the
field, and implement other measures to improve coffee quality. Surveys need to be conducted of coffee
farmers to establish their cost of production and to devise a cost-effective strategy for increasing
production. Participation in the coffee futures market to reduce uncertainty of pricing should be explored.

                                                     61
For tea, the transition to private sector ownership and management should be carefully facilitated with
policies and models that provide sufficient incentives to farmers to increase yields and expand production
and that are monitored to identify and deal with challenges as they arise.

48.         Increase reliability of agricultural statistics. An important goal of PSTA 3 is to improve the
reliability of agricultural statistics in close coordination with NISR. Capacity building is required to
collect and disseminate accurate agricultural statistics, which are needed for making effective policy
decisions.

Program Development Objective: The PDO is to increase and intensify the productivity of the Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and
expand the development of value chains.

The proposed operation supports the Government of Rwanda’s strategic objectives of the Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 with
aims to enhance food security and nutrition contributing to a reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation supports four broad
program areas: i) agriculture and animal resource intensification; ii) research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; iii) value chain
development and private sector investment; and iv) institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues.

  Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index was developed and is currently being compiled by IFPRI, with a focus on the countries supported
by Feed the Future Programme (supported by USAID). Rwanda is included in the coverage and tracking of this index. The index includes the
increased percentage of women in the total membership and leadership positions of agricultural farmer organizations and cooperatives.

Description and Assessment of Program Results Framework and M&E

1.       During the initial identification mission of the Ag. PforR operation, the Bank team worked
closely with and supported MINAGRI’s PSTA 3 team to prepare a comprehensive and summary
results framework (RF), underpinned by an explicit results chain specified at three levels, measured by
“SMART” indicators, and their corresponding baselines and targets: impact level for the overall PSTA 3;
outcome level for each of the four programs; and outcome and output level for each of the 24
subprograms (SPs) (see PforR file for the copy of the comprehensive PSTA 3 RF). Once the targets for all
outputs were costed, there was an excessive financing gap for the “high-cost scenario”; this led to a
reduction in the targets for various outputs based on the consistent application of five prioritization
criteria to develop a “medium-cost scenario.” There were several iterations of PSTA 3’s RF, resulting in
enhanced capacity and strong ownership by key MINAGRI counterparts. Based on this PSTA 3 RF, the
Bank team derived a modified version of the RF for the purposes of the PforR support operation.

2.      The team also supported the formulation of the strategic objective (SO) as outlined in the
RF for SP 4.4 (MIS: Agriculture M&E, Statistics and Communication) to strengthen the efficiency,
effectiveness, access to, and utilization of an enhanced management information system (MIS) for the
agriculture sector that would contribute to enhanced evidenced-based decision making. This would
involve the following component systems (with the RF outlining relevant outcomes and outputs): i)
Monitoring and Evaluation system; ii) Agricultural Statistical System, including enhanced national food
security and nutrition information system; and iii) Agricultural Communication System. This SO is highly
relevant for supporting the effective implementation of PSTA 3, with support from the PforR operation.

3.      Agricultural MIS: M&E, Statistics and Communications. MINAGRI’s current MIS play s
an important role in endeavoring to provide a sectoral perspective to the implementation of PSTA
3. However, the MIS is somewhat fragmented, whereby each entity of MINAGRI (Planning Department,
RAB, NAEB, and the three SPIUs) have their own M&E, statistical and knowledge management system,
and data generation, which is then compiled by the central system. The Bank team reviewed MINAGRI’s
current M&E system, 70 and identified and consolidated the main constraints, which were: i) there is no
unified system in place to link the various institutions/organizations performing M&E in the agriculture
sector (MINAGRI -coordinated by the Planning Department, and its main implementation agencies RAB,
NAEB, and three SPIUs). Each of the institutions/organizations focuses on input/output indicators as
specified in their performance contracts and not relating to PSTA 3; ii) MINAGRI functions to a certain
extent as lead agency for M&E operations but does not link them to PSTA 3 as of yet. Neither does it
cover the level of strategic objectives, but instead remains at an operational level; iii) the formats used are
not harmonized and are oversimplified, so questions arise as to the validity and reliability of the collected
data; and iv) M&E at all agricultural institutions suffers from shortages of adequately trained personnel as
well as of budgetary means.

4.      At the subnational level, the M&E assessment highlighted an additional set of constraints at
District and sectoral levels, which included: i) a focus on the priorities being determined at a higher
level (national and District); ii) some reliability issues in the way that crop production/productivity
harvest data are generated and reported; and iii) the diverse reporting formats used at various levels,
which pose additional challenges to the reliable aggregation of production data.




70
   Also, a recent assessment of the M&E system in support of preparing the evaluation framework of PSTA 3 identified system-
related constraints which are included in the World Bank’s assessment (see M&E Framework and ASIP for PSTA 3:
Intermediate Final Report (May, 2014), prepared by EU-funded consultants).

                                                             66
5.       In light of the above assessment, the PforR operation includes a framework for updating
and consolidating an action plan for strengthening the agricultural MIS/M&E system for
MINAGRI, in a manner that is integrated and supportive of the M&E systems for each of MINAGRI’s
entities (RAB, NAEB, the three SPIUs) while taking a sectoral approach in line with the RF for PSTA 3.
In support of MINAGRI’s intention, the Bank supported MINAGRI’s recent formation of a MIS working
group (in July 2014). It was established (with members from various agencies within MINAGRI) and
conducted various working sessions to derive and develop a consensus around a “core” RF for PSTA 3.
This larger “core” RF reflects the key indicators highlighted in the above RF for PforR operation and
includes some additional indicators for the overall sector and each of the four programs. With support
from the EU, MINAGRI has taken steps to prepare a TOR and to mobilize international technical
assistance (during 2014) to help operationalize the agricultural MIS, utilizing the expanded core RF.

6.      With the implementation of PSTA 3, which is now underpinned by a comprehensive RF, it
is timely that MINAGRI is taking coordinated actions to develop and implement an operational
MIS action plan, building on the experience/lessons of implementing MINAGRI’s M&E framework
of 2011 and the emerging MIS/M&E framework (June 2014). It is expected that this work will
include the following aspects:

    i)      An aligned and harmonized M&E framework (including the evaluation framework of PSTA
            3) with PSTA 3’s RF, and the expanded “core” RF;
    ii)     Operationalized, in a sound and phased manner, data collection systems, processes, and
            institutional roles at national and subnational levels to focus on generating realistic, reliable,
            and timely data on the key results and their “SMART” indicators at the impact, outcome , and
            output levels in line with the RF for PSTA 3;
    iii)    Organizational and coordination improvements to better integrate the agricultural M&E
            systems at national and subnational levels, with a focus on the main indicators outlined in the
            RF and Evaluation Framework of PSTA 3 (e.g., continue the monthly planning and M&E
            meetings convened by the DG of Planning, supported by follow-up activities);
    iv)     Adequately qualified and experienced technical MIS staff at the national and subnational
            levels (e.g., increased M&E staff in MINAGRI’s Planning Department to better coordinate
            and consolidate the diverse M&E systems spread across MINAGRI, RAB, NAEB, SPIUs,
            and Districts; post an M&E officer at the District level (currently a proposal being promoted
            by MINALOC as part of the decentralization strategy) who can devote increased attention to
            coordinating with and integrating M&E activities with the enhanced MINAGRI M&E
            framework;
    v)      MIS/M&E activities that devote adequate attention to systematizing relevant experiences and
            good practices that can be scaled up and out as part of PSTA 3’s implementation period, and
            used as inputs for the design of PSTA 4; and
    vi)     A MINAGRI-devised and -delivered training program to strengthen the various MIS
            activities outlined above, involving relevant staff at national and subnational levels.

7.      During implementation of the proposed PforR operation, the Bank team will continue to
support MINAGRI’s ongoing initiative to prepare and implement an operational MIS plan
(including capacity development gaps). These MIS activities comprise one of the DLIs, and will be
coordinated with other DPs (especially the EU, which is playing a key role in providing required technical
assistance).

8.      Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers. Research and extension
interventions are linked directly to one result (Extension coverage) and indirectly to the DLI on increased
average productivity of major food and export crops and livestock. The extension result focuses on
increasing the ratio of extension agents to farmer households from the current 1:839 to 1:600 in 2017/18.

                                                     67
The basic assumption is that the increased extension agent to farmer ratio will increase access to
information and technologies and subsequently lead to higher technology adoption and productivity gains.
This DLI is important in ensuring technology transfer to farmers, is easy to measure, and can be verified
with minimal costs. The research and technology transfer SP has developed clear key results focusing on
development of technologies for farmers and their adoption rates. However, it is important to caution that
adoption of technologies can be influenced by a number of social and economic factors, some of which
are beyond the full control of implementing agencies. Furthermore, the research-extension (R-E) linkages
that are key to ensuring an effective and efficient technology transfer system are found to be weak and a
major risk to the technology transfer objectives.

9.       Promotion of food crops value chains. Key results have been clearly set regarding the
productivity gains expected from each of the main food crops. The SP is also directly linked to one DLI
on increased average productivity of major food and export crops. In regard to food crops, the
productivity DLI has targeted the growth in yield of cassava. The set yield target for this food crop is
achievable based on past growth trends. However, a conservative approach is advocated for in setting the
yield targets given the predominance of rainfed production systems for most of the food crops (rice may
be the exception), the emerging effects of climate change, and the not-too-solid database for verification
of these yields at a national level. Furthermore, global evidence indicate that yields increases are usually
low over the long term and growth rates slow considerably as more farmers approach the yield frontiers
of any given technological regime. Given the foregoing, the Bank would encourage the Borrower’s team
to review the set yield targets based on these considerations.

10.      MIS/M&E capacity. The M&E capacity, including data processing and arrangements for
reporting for research and technology transfer and for targets set under food crops are in existence, but
needs to be strengthened. While the results set under research and extension are straightforward to
measure and report, measuring and reporting the yield results at the national level is more demanding. A
reliable and elaborate structure and system to capture and process the data on production, productivity
levels, and area under different crops is currently not well developed, and therefore needs to be put in
place.

       Annex 3: Detailed Description and Assessment of Program Strategic Objectives and Relevance

1.      Overview. In spite of the progress in reducing the numbers of poor households, the challenge of
poverty reduction remains high, since 80 percent of the rural population consists of subsistence farm
families with an average land size of 0.59 ha (EICV 3). The Government of Rwanda’s (GoR’s) Transformation
of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 (PSTA 3) strategic objectives are to: i) intensify, commercialize and
transform the Rwandan agriculture sector to enhance food security and nutrition, reduce poverty and drive
economic growth; and ii) accelerate sustainable increases and expanded private sector role in production,
processing and value–addition and commercialization of staple crops, export commodities and livestock products.

2.      The PforR operation’s development objective is to increase and intensify the productivity of the
Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and expand the development of value chains. The proposed operation
supports the strategic objectives of PSTA 3 with aims to enhance food security and nutrition contributing to a
reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation supports four broad program areas: i)
agriculture and animal resource intensification; ii) research, technology transfer and professionalization of
farmers; iii) value chain development and private sector investment; and iv) institutional development and
agricultural cross-cutting issues.

3.        Increased productivity and production along with increased commercialization of that production and
increased off-farm self-employment generated by increasing the number of food and export crop value chains
from 2008-2012 were responsible for over 45 percent of poverty reduction (and up to 58 percent if all off-farm
self-employment is the direct result of increased self-employment associated with farm commodities) and for
facilitating over 1 million Rwandans to lift themselves above the poverty line. Given these facts, the strategic
objectives of PSTA 3 are both critical and relevant and are focused on lifting an additional 3 million Rwandans
above the poverty line.

4.      The four programs of PSTA 3 and their associated subprograms (SPs) are similar to PSTA 2 in
structure and content, with greater emphasis on increasing private sector investment in the sector. PSTA 2
was highly successful and delivered on over 90 percent of the planned results. In addition, many of the results and
targets were exceeded, some by as much as 200 percent.

5.       Much of PSTA 3 is focused on improving efficiencies and economies of scale and mainstreaming the
activities that are the key drivers of agriculture development (land husbandry actions including land
conservation – terracing, increasing soil fertility – organic and inorganic fertilization, increasing use of improved
seeds, expanding land under irrigation, increasing coverage and quality of extension services and increasing
private sector-led mechanization); enhancing market-responsive technology research; significantly expanding and
strengthening accessible agricultural finance products; stimulating expanded and inclusive private sector and
market-driven value chain development and integration; expanding market-oriented rural infrastructure (i.e.,
irrigation, rural feeder roads, and post-harvest facilities); and strengthening institutional development and
strategic cross-cutting themes.

6.      The World Bank technical team reviewed and evaluated all four programs and their 24 SPs and
found not only PSTA 3’s high-level strategic objectives but also the strategic objectives for each of the four
programs and their SPs to be adequate, of strategic important, necessary, and relevant to achieving the key
results and desired impacts of PSTA 3. They also address the key developmental issues in the sector to increase
economic development and reduce poverty. The program has a suitable focus of public expenditure related to
policy and other enabling environment investments and focuses on increasing private sector investment in the
sector with an appropriate mix of PPP investments planned. Below is a detailed review of the relevance of each of
the programs and SPs as assessed by the World Bank technical specialists.

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

                                                         69
7.       Summary. The strategic objective for program 1 is transforming the physical environment of land,
soil, and water by: i) scaling up successful productivity interventions; ii) expanding quality and yield-
augmenting inputs; and iii) developing the animal resource sector, contributing to enhanced food security
and nutrition and increased value of production. Its SPs focus on soil conservation and land husbandry,
irrigation and water management, agricultural mechanization, agrochemical use and markets, and seeds and
livestock development. Given the land constraints and no agriculture frontier to exploit, the smallholder structure
of land ownership, and limited livestock and animal resources per capita, both the program’s strategic objectives
and the SPs are key in addressing the productivity and food and nutrition security challenges of the country.

8.        Soil conservation and land husbandry are of strategic importance since 90 percent of Rwanda’s
soils are on hillsides, some with steep slopes. Most of these soils are old and have been nutrient-depleted for an
extended period due to overcultivation. The soil is subject to higher rates of erosion, as Rwanda loses up to
40,000 tons of soil per year to erosion and so far only 73 percent of arable land is covered with some type of
erosion-control infrastructure. However, the effectiveness of this infrastructure is only 53 percent. 71 Soil
conservation and land husbandry are key factors in increasing agricultural productivity. Thus, reducing erosion
and improving the quality of soils is of strategic importance in achieving PSTA 3’s strategic objectives for
productivity. Different techniques that have been implemented, such as terracing, composting, green manure,
organic mulching, and agroforestry, will need to be scaled up nationally and promoted throughout the entire
MINAGRI structure. These techniques improve the soil’s organic matter content, water holding capacity,
infiltration rate, and microorganism activity. MINAGRI has developed a solid methodology for determining the
appropriate soil conservation techniques for various soils and slope categories and has defined the national
baseline for lands protected against erosion. Lessons from current World Bank-financed operations, LWH and
RSSP, indicate that appropriate soil conservation and land husbandry measures can increase productivity up to
four times, reclaim marginal lands, and reduce erosion by up to 66 percent.

9.      Irrigation and water management are also vitally important to address pressing climate change
issues and reduce dependency on rainfall, which can be erratic and cause crop failure. So far, only 23,000 ha
of land are irrigated; the target is to increase this to 63,000 ha over the PSTA 3 period through irrigation
development in marshlands and hillsides.

10.      Agricultural mechanization is of strategic relevance to the achievement of PSTA 3’s objectives. To
transform farming into a productive, high-value, market-oriented sector, improved agricultural mechanization is
imperative (e.g., alternative farm power, with appropriate technologies for the Rwandan context, such as low-cost
motorized engines and draught animals). Until recently, mechanization efforts stalled in Rwanda due to social
disruptions and subsequent realignment of priorities. Mechanization has become even more important for the
following related reasons: i) the need to open up unused lands to increase area under production, especially under
irrigation, and raise productivity of existing lands; ii) promoting youth in agriculture by reducing the drudgery on
farms by using mechanization, and consequently reducing rural-urban migration and mitigating urban
unemployment, which has become a social problem; iii) addressing seasonal labor constraints, especially in light
of the CIP, thereby enabling farmers to benefit from multiple cropping systems with varying land preparation
periods; iv) machinery such as pumps, diesel engines, and related equipment can facilitate efficient and equitable
access to water, especially for smallholder farmers; and v) appropriate mechanization in agroprocessing and value
addition can help increase profitability of farming and improve rural livelihoods by generating income and
employment opportunities.

11.      Currently 13 percent of farm operations are mechanized in Rwanda, including land preparation,
planting, crop treatment, harvesting, post-harvesting, and agroprocessing. The use of animal traction or
tractors is isolated and does not significantly contribute to agricultural production in Rwanda. This needs to be

                                                        70
enhanced and combined with improved mechanization, fertilizer, and seeds to achieve the ambitious growth rate
of 8.5 percent within the next five years as stated in PSTA 3.

12.      Agrochemical use and markets. A key factor for low productivity in the agriculture sector is low
and decreasing soil fertility. Nutrient depletion rates in Rwanda are estimated to be in the order of 77 kg/ha,
among the highest in Africa. This translates into a reduction of the country’s capacity to feed its people. Hence,
pursuing increased and sustained agricultural productivity growth, a key strategic objective of PSTA 3, requires a
deliberate effort to ensure large-scale increases of inorganic fertilizers - to 45 kg/ha by 2017 from the current rate
of about 35 kg/ha. This is predicated on the fact that Rwanda recorded increased productivity rates in the recent
past, corresponding to increases in fertilizer use rates. Fertilizer use increased from 4.2 kg/ha in 2005 to 29 kg/ha
in 2012, corresponding to a maize yield increase from 0.64 t/ha to 2.9 t/ha, while wheat yields increased 2.5 times
during the same period. This has made a compelling case for the emphasis on fertilizer use in PSTA 3.72

13.     Increases in fertilizer use in Rwanda have been driven mainly through an input subsidy program,
as part of the CIP. Since 2008, the GoR has invested in efforts to build an efficient input subsidy program that
has contributed increasing fertilizer use among farmers from 3 percent (2007) to 38 percent (2014). Over the last
three years, fertilizer use has increased to about 30,000 tons, but potential use is approximately 90,000 tons.
Given fiscal constraints and sustainability requirements, a market-led approach would be required to reach the
next level of sustainable uptake, with the GoR investing more of its efforts and resources in creating an enabling
environment for private investment in the fertilizer sector and investing in public goods. The current situation,
with only two major distributors in the fertilizer sector, cannot stimulate competition in the fertilizer market.
Currently, the GoR is finalizing a comprehensive fertilizer policy paper that would lay out the roadmap for a more
appropriate and sustainable approach to stimulating fertilizer usage.

14.     Seed development. Mechanization and fertilizer must be complemented by improved good quality
seeds to increase agricultural productivity. Seed is an essential, strategic, and relatively inexpensive input to
agriculture with a high rate of return on investment that often sets the upper limit for crop production. The use of
improved, high-yielding crop varieties can make the difference between a household with an improved livelihood
and one trapped in rural poverty and hunger. Inevitably, achievement of PSTA 3’s strategic objectives would
remain an illusion without development of a vibrant, private sector-driven seed industry. Current improved seed
use rates are low, partly contributing to the low productivity of cereals of about 1 t/ha, on average, versus a
potential of over 6 t/ha. Consequently, seed sector development is critical to ensuring increased and sustained
agricultural productivity in Rwanda.

15.      As in the fertilizer sector, the seed sector is not entirely free of government intervention or
disincentives for investment. For the major crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and Irish potatoes, seeds are
supplied to farmers under a government-sponsored seed subsidy program. However, the GoR plans to gradually
phase out the subsidy program over the next three to four years. During the subsidy draw-down phase, the
government would purchase seed from private companies, the quantity of which would reduce gradually over the
years, phasing out completely over three to four years’ time. In preparation for phasing out, the government is
finalizing a comprehensive seeds policy paper, which includes encouraging the private sector to enter into the
seed production business. So far, one seed company has registered and in fact produced seed during the last
cropping season. It is believed that the seed companies would inherit the current seed producers, especially the
individual farmers, as contract growers.

16.    Livestock Development. The two livestock-related SPs (1.6 – Livestock Development and 3.4 –
Development of priority value chains: meat and dairy) are of good overall strategic relevance and

USAID, Rwanda, 22-23 February.

                                                                71
complement each other well. Livestock can clearly contribute to achieving objectives of inclusive growth for the
country and poverty reduction as stated in EDPRS 2 and Vision 2020. The strategic objective of SP1.6 is to
enhance the productivity of animal resources and quality of animal products for improved transformative growth
of the livestock subsector, with a focus on smallholders. Therefore, it is also perfectly in line with the PforR
operation’s objective. In such a landlocked, mountainous, and high-density population country, limited arable
lands and access to natural resources, including pasture and water, remain the major constraints and bottleneck to
livestock development and competitiveness. Therefore, the objectives of livestock intensification, productivity
increase, and animal production diversification (fishery/beekeeping) appear to be the best strategy for the
subsector’s development. Expanded livestock development, including livestock, fisheries, and honey, can
contribute to two important types of benefits for rural populations: enhanced nutrition levels and increased rural
incomes.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer, advisory services and professionalization of farmers

17.     Summary. The strategic objective of program 2 to is to significantly and sustainably increase
agricultural production and productivity through ensuring an efficient, effective, and market-responsive
research and extension system, driven by: i) modern technologies s uitable for Rwanda’s agro-ecological
environment; ii) more effective extension, education, and training of farmers; iii) greater access to and
uptake of these technologies; iv) improved agricultural productivity and stronger farmers’ cooperatives;
and v) other partnerships to help farmers better engage in input and output markets, and thereby increase
rural incomes. The SPs are: i) research and technology transfer; ii) extension and proximity services for
producers; and iii) farmers’ cooperatives and organizations.

18.      One of the current challenges is increasing the agriculture research function to meet the need to
facilitate and increase both production gains and commercialization. Research is key to increasing crop and
livestock productivity, improving natural resource management, meeting market requirements, and responding to
farmers’ needs. Despite recent increases, the quality of extension services and their accessibility have been a
challenge. To increase production and commercialization of the agriculture sector, farmers’ cooperatives will play
a key role. However, although improving, cooperative management has sometimes been a challenge, along with
higher levels of farmer engagement. The SP for research, extension, and professionalization of farmers via
cooperatives was assessed and the strategic objectives, results, outcome, outputs, and activities were found to be
sufficient to address the key constraints in this area.

19.      Research, technology transfer, professionalization of farmers, and extension services for producers
are all of key strategic relevance to the achievement of PSTA 3’s strategic objectives and targets. No credible
productivity and commercialization gains can be made without an effective technology development and transfer
system, tailored to Rwandan conditions. Agricultural research is a classic public good because information
generation is nonexcludable. Equally, the envisaged expansion of private sector investment will only occur if
investors are assured of enough trade volumes and organization of farmers into formalized groups able to
mobilize and collect adequate trade volumes. Furthermore, the professionalization of smallholder farmers and
their organization into cooperatives and other farmers’ groups are necessary to ensure they can enjoy economies
of scale in input and output markets, as well as the necessary clout to bargain and benefit from market-driven
trade relationships.

20.     The current research and technology transfer functions are currently dominated by the public
sector through the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), which is mandated to undertake agricultural research
for crops and livestock, agricultural development (mainly extension and input supply), animal resource
development, and provision of rural infrastructure (mainly storage facilities) and mechanization. As part of the
GoR’s decentralization strategies, the 30 District administrations also play a key role in delivery of extension
services at the local level (based on a 3-tier structure and outreach system—District, Sector, and Cell levels).
RAB’s zonal offices provide technical backstopping and training to the District-level outreach system, which now

                                                       72
includes farmer promoters and para vets. Most of the services provided by RAB have a significant public good
element and hence may not immediately attract private providers. However, mixed provisioning of extension and
other services is beginning to emerge. Nevertheless, research remains a preserve of the public sector, and initial
steps are being taken by RAB to expand the actors.

21.      Farmers’ cooperatives and organizations. Community participation and community-led solutions
have been highlighted as good practices throughout the PSTA 2 period. The objective of this SP is to
strengthen cooperatives and farmers’ organizations, including men and women, for: improved governance,
management, and technical knowledge; effective delivery of enhanced services; and more effective and market-
based linkages with input and output markets. Rwandan agricultural policies and strategies focus on
intensification and increased market orientation of the smallholder agriculture sector, and farmers’ cooperatives
are seen as an important and principal vehicle to achieve this goal. However, farmers’
organizations’/cooperatives’ capacities need to be strengthened in management, institutional, and entrepreneurial
skills. Inadequate operational strategies exist to enhance cooperatives and farmers’ organizations to assume an
expanded and effective role. New bottom-up and inclusive approaches are required to bring innovations to both
on-farm and off-farm activities. Most technological innovations and extension services are driven from the top,
and therefore have limited outreach. The lessons from the experience in the ongoing projects in the sector show
that farmers with eroded human capital can benefit greatly from a bottom-up approach coupled with introduction
of new appropriate technological processes and instruments that improve productivity and deliver extension and
other services in a timely, cost-effective manner. There is also a lack of operational guidelines to ensure effective
arrangements and modalities between extension (RAB and District administrations) and Rwanda Cooperative
Agency (RCA), taking into account the recent revisions of the Cooperative Law. At the institutional level,
extension agents have inadequate capacity to provide the required training/technical assistance to cooperatives
and farmers’ organizations, especially given the ambitious productivity targets.

22.       The number of agricultural cooperatives in the country expanded rapidly during the past few years - from
645 in 2008 to 1,877 in 2013. Agricultural cooperatives include production cooperatives (such as coffee, maize,
etc.), service cooperatives (such as land, fertilizer distribution, etc.), and marketing cooperatives (where marketing
of farm produce is done collectively) – or a mixture of these. PSTA 3 envisages increasing the number of
cooperatives to 2,500 by 2017-18, as well strengthening them to be more effective in serving their members.

23.     PSTA 3, with support from the Ag. PforR, is designed to address some of the key constraints to
agricultural growth in the country, which entails a need for both larger-scale community-based infrastructure and
enhanced and market-driven farmers’ organizations and capacity development. The farmers’ organizational
aspects are therefore critical for achieving the program’s expected outcomes for increasing agricultural production
and commercial agriculture as outlined in PSTA 3. The broader goal is to ensure a “bottom -up” development
process in the sector, such as establishing bottom-up farmers’ organizations, enabling participatory planning and
decision-making processes, and strengthening community-based credit institutions.

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

24.      Summary. The strategic objective of program 3 is to significantly enhance the agricultural business
environment and an expanded private sector role in promoting competitive and inclusive value chain
development, including: i) expanded access to finance; ii) a strengthened agricultural market system through
removing market barriers and an expanded rural infrastructure, with emphasis on storage and feeder roads; and iii)
expanded agriculture commercialization for domestic, regional, and international markets. The SPs that support
this objective are: i) creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship, and
facilitate market access; ii) developing priority value chains for food and export crops, dairy and meat, fisheries,
and apiculture; iii) improving agricultural finance; and iv) supporting market-oriented infrastructure for post-
harvest handling and storage.


                                                         73
25.     Greater volumes of production will require markets, processing facilities, and value addition to
create growth. Domestic production continues to be hampered by a lack of post-harvest facilities and the
dearth of agricultural financing available. Having an enabling environment to attract increased private sector
investment to add premium to productivity increases has been lacking. Strengthening value chains and reducing
losses through post-harvest facilities are needed to generate more income and employment in activities like
product processing, packaging, and marketing. Another fundamental challenge for Rwanda in the regional context
and for wider international markets is the high cost of inputs, which affects competiveness.

26.     Program 3 and its SPs were reviewed in detail and found to contain the results and activities needed
to achieve the strategic objectives if implemented as planned.

27.      The objective is to create an environment to attract expanded and inclusive private investment to
the agriculture sector, encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate market access to both inputs and
outputs. Program 3 responds to the government’s development objectives as set out in Vision 2020, which
envisions a modern and diversified agriculture sector that is private sector-led and provides high-value
commodities for export, while enhancing domestic food security. It also recognizes that the continued
intensification and commercialization of the Rwandan agriculture sector will be essential to drive inclusive
economic growth and reduce poverty. Developing, rapidly expanding, and diversifying competitive agriculture
exports remains one of biggest contributors to the theme of rural development and economic transformation of
EDPRS 2. Program 3 implements programs aimed at expanding and diversifying agriculture exports in areas
where Rwanda has a proven comparative and competitive advantage to accelerate economic growth and increase
rural incomes and food security.

28.     Development of priority food crops value chains. Enhancement of food security and nutrition
remains a key strategic objective of the GoR and a key subprogram under PSTA 3. Food crops that include
commodities that are regionally and internationally tradable but exclude crops produced for export only account
for 85 percent of agricultural GDP. According to the national accounts, the value of food crop production in
constant prices rose by 24 percent from 2008 to 2012.73 This substantially exceeded the target set in PSTA 2 and
was due principally to the success of the CIP and LUC Program. Under PSTA 3, eight food crop value chains
have been prioritized: bananas, wheat, maize, rice, Irish potatoes, cassava, soya beans, and beans. The size of this
subsector makes it clear that even modest growth in these food crops will have a much larger effect on the overall
agricultural and economic growth and poverty reduction of the country than rapid growth in smaller export crops.
Most of the food crops are grown by a majority of smallholder farmers and are therefore crucial to poverty
reduction and food security goals.

29.      Development of priority export value chains. Tea, coffee, horticulture, and pyrethrum are among
the key export value chains prioritized for support in PSTA 3 and this Ag. PforR . Rwanda has a proven
comparative advantage in these four value chains as confirmed by recent analyses (2014) and expanding private
sector activities. It is worth noting that recent analyses have shown that the export value chains’ p.a. growth rates
need to be at least 22 percent to contribute to the EDPRS 2 overall agriculture sector growth target of 8.5 percent
p.a. Also, the export subsector is critically important for Rwanda in terms of generating valuable foreign
exchange, while creating improved income and job opportunities for rural households. This program is a priority
for the GoR as evidenced by the fact that targets set for export value chains are found in performance contracts of
different institutions involving MINAGRI/NAEB and affiliated agencies. The government has also already
initiated various activities focusing on reviewing the legal and regulatory frameworks governing these export
value chains, infrastructure deficits and requirements, and subsector expansion and productivity enhancement
programs. The government envisions a significantly greater role for the private sector in leading the planned
expansion and intensification programs in the priority value chains. Private sector feedback confirms that private
investors are ready and interested to take on an expanded role in all four value chains.

30.     Development of Priority Value Chains: Dairy and Meat. The need to improve productivity all along
the dairy and meat value chains, including at the input suppliers, processing, and marketing levels, not only
at the upstream farm-production level, is well captured in PSTA 3. The GoR’s objective is to double per
capita milk consumption from about 36 liters/person/year to 80 liters. This cannot be achieved only by increasing
milk production; milk processing (only 10 percent of milk is estimated to be processed currently) and marketing
along the value chain as well as important public awareness and communication campaigns also need to be
promoted. This is well in line with the strategic objective of the GoR to enhance food security and nutrition;
however, doubling per capita consumption might be overambitious over a three-year period. In addition to
national consumption, demand for meat and hides and skin exported to neighboring central African countries is
important, representing a strategic market to be targeted. However, given the lack of natural resources and cost of
animal feeding, the competitiveness of Rwandan meat products remains questionable and national strategy
documents, including PSTA 3, lack evidence that it could be.

31.       Development of Priority Value Chains: Fisheries. With only 27,000 MT of fish produced (80
percent capture fish) in 2013 and a 2 kg/person/year consumption rate, fisheries remain a small subsector.
It is estimated that about 70 percent of the production is informally exported to neighboring countries, including
DRC, but that an additional 15,000 MT are imported to fulfill national consumption needs. Management of
resources is currently neither well organized nor sustainable. The Master Plan for Fisheries developed and
endorsed in 2011 by the GoR highlights the potentially large growth of this subsector and the strategic relevance
of supporting the development of its value chain, from feed production (now 100 percent imported) to
aquaculture, fish processing (as 20 percent of the production is lost), and marketing.

32.     Development of Priority Value Chains: Apiculture. Similarly, the apiculture subsector remains at
an early stage of development. However, as 90 percent of the almost 70,000 producers involved in beekeeping
are “traditional,” the strategic relevance of supporting this value chain is high, as it will positively impact
smallholder producers and contribute to shared growth. With the urbanization of the country and an emerging
middle class, the demand for high value-added processed products, such as high-quality honey, royal jelly, and
beeswax, is fast growing, and cannot currently be fulfilled. The GoR is now finalizing a new National Strategic
Plan for this sector.

33.     Agricultural finance. Both PSTA 3 and EDPRS 2 prioritize agriculture as a core source of jobs and
economic transformation. Continued and sustained agricultural commercialization and intensification play an
important role in the vision for the future. The overall strategic objective outlined for the agricultural finance SP is
deemed relevant to the government’s development objectives given: i) the government’s abovementioned broad
objective to align the agricultural growth trajectory with increased productivity and commercialization, and the
increased role financial services will have to play to achieve these targets; ii) the unsustainability of government-
dominated investments to drive sector growth, and thus the greater need for diversified and market-based
financing sources and mechanisms; and iii) the unique character of the agriculture sector, which predominantly
consists of large numbers of smallholders, although the presence of strong cooperatives suggests both the need
and prospects for diversified and innovative products tailored to their needs.

34.      As the overall objective of expanded and inclusive access to viable agriculture loans and enhanced
recovery rates is to increase the volume, variety, and accessibility of agricultural finance products, aiming
to increase the number of commercial loans extended by the commercial banking industry is indeed
strategically sound. Moreover, since the sustainability of any improvements in this sector will be affected by the
performance of agricultural loans, which will in return be reflected in interest rates, any support in this area should
target a percentage decrease in non performing loans (NPLs) as well as an increase in loan volumes. Having a
supportive policy framework is particularly relevant in the context of agricultural and livestock insurance, as the
most convenient form of insurance (in terms of premium and coverage) indeed requires appropriate government
support. Expanded targeted agricultural savings mobilization through strengthened SACCOs and other

                                                          75
appropriate financial institutions is a direct contribution to the objective of diversification and extension of the
reach of financial products to smallholder farmers.

35.     Market-oriented Infrastructure for Post-Harvest. Rural feeder roads are considered to be a critical
factor to stimulate increased agricultural production and commercialization, which is the core objective of
PSTA 3, aiming to contribute to EDPRS 2 objectives of raising growth and creating jobs. PSTA 3 stresses
the need to expand the rural feeder road network to reduce post-harvest losses and the price of delivering
agricultural inputs in project areas. Expanded feeder road development will also contribute to social protection by
promoting employment generation through public works.

36.      Post-harvest. Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level. In
support of the CIP, MINAGRI’s Post-Harvest Taskforce developed and adopted a National Post-Harvest Strategy
designed to assist with: strengthening harvesting, post-harvest handling, trade, storage, and marketing within
staple crop value chains; strengthening markets and linkages for farmers; and reducing post-harvest losses. This
initially addressed the challenges that accrued following successful implementation of the CIP, which increased
crop yields with unanticipated surpluses in key staple grains and cereals and hence incurred heavy post-harvest
losses due to the lack of capacity in post-harvest handling and storage. To achieve PSTA 3’s objective of
increasing agricultural growth by 8.5 percent, it is critical to ensure investment in storage capacities to hold
surplus production and reduce post-harvest losses, and consequently maximize net profits for small-scale farmers
and reduce food insecurity. Small farmers generally lack the capital and know-how to efficiently harvest, store,
and market their surplus production. MINAGRI estimates that farmers experience between 15-22 percent annual
post-harvest losses in cereals. These losses have direct adverse impacts on producers and consumers, reducing
farmers’ incomes and raising consumer prices as a result of diminished supplies. Managing post-harvest losses
would essentially be consistent with MINAGRI’s five-year action plan, approved in March 2011 by the
Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG) of Rwanda. To ensure efficiency and sustainability, efforts should be
made to ensure private sector investment in the storage structures directly or through PPP arrangements in
managing public storage facilities.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

37.      Summary. The strategic objectives of program 4 are to: i) build the sector’s capacity to deliver in
an efficient, effective, and increasingly decentralized manner with enhanced gender-responsive and youth-
friendly policies and services; and ii) to provide a conducive policy and legal framework and reliable
statistics for rapid and sustainable agricultural growth. The seven SPs are: i) institutional capacity building;
ii) decentralization in agriculture: iii) legal and regulatory framework; iv) MIS: agricultural communication,
statistical systems, M&E and knowledge management; v) gender and youth in agriculture; vi) environmental
mainstreaming in agriculture; and vii) nutrition and household vulnerability.

38.     Key challenges that program 4 seek to address. In recent years the institutional arrangements of
the agriculture sector have performed well, with many successful projects and steady growth. The
remaining institutional challenges need to be addressed through a comprehensive approach to both capacity
building and institutional coordination. District administrations have important roles, as they are in close contact
with cooperatives and farmers and can build up knowledge of the Districts’ needs and opportunities for
agricultural development. However, these functions need to be strengthened to be more effective. The quality of
agriculture and animal products needs to be improved and adhere to national and international required norms and
standards. Therefore, a review of the current related regulatory framework in the agriculture sector is needed to
update laws and formulate new ones in accordance with East African Community (EAC) and international
regulations.




                                                        76
39.      Rwanda is accelerating its transformation from an agrarian, subsistence economy into a
sophisticated, knowledge-based society. However, the agriculture sector is characterized by insufficient use of
improved local and advanced knowledge and technologies. Although Rwanda has made great steps towards
achieving gender quality, gender disparities are still prevalent in agriculture. The main challenge for youth is
providing employment opportunities and the training necessary to obtain the higher-skilled jobs that will help
them break out of poverty. Agriculture and the environment affect each other and must be considered together. To
foster a sustainable agriculture sector in the long term, sound environmental management must be mainstreamed
in agricultural practices. Food production is increasing and food flows relatively easily within and outside the
country. However, EICV 3 identified that in 2012, 82,000 households (4 percent) had poor and 378,000
households (17 percent) had borderline food consumption patterns. These households are vulnerable to seasonal
shortages and also have inadequate provision in the case of drought or excess rainfall, both of which reduce
harvests.

40.    Program 4 and its eight SPs were reviewed and assessed to be relevant to address the above sector
challenges and if adequately implemented, should produce the desired outputs, outcomes, results, and
development impacts.

41.     Institutional capacity building. The institutional capacity building strategic objective (SO), derived
from the RF for PSTA 3, is sound and highly relevant. This SO is well aligned to Vision 2020, EDPRS 2, and
PSTA 3 to enable and support the agriculture sector: i) to fulfill its intended strategic role; and ii) to
position/enhance roles and capacities of MINAGRI and its key entities (RAB, NAEB) and Districts to carry out
the proposed SOs of other SPs and to meet their ambitious targets at impact, outcome, and output levels, as well
as to ensure enhance governance in the sector, including significantly improved M&E systems and follow-up
mechanisms.

42.     Decentralization in Agriculture. Overall, the SO for decentralization in agriculture and its four SPs
is highly relevant to support the achievement of the higher-level objectives outlined in EDPRS 2 and PSTA
3. The four key elements are interconnected, complementary, and contribute to the achievement of the SOs. They
also help operationalize the actions needed to support the implementation of the government’s Decentralization
Implementation Plan/DIP (2011-2015) with respect to the agriculture sector. Especially during the past year, there
have been a number of important initiatives to further operationalize MINAGRI’s decentralization strategies a t the
operational level. Many of these activities are ongoing and are generally making good progress.74

43.     Legal and Regulatory Framework. The legal and regulatory framework, including compliance with
international phytosanitary standards (SPS), is a key cross-cutting program of PSTA 3. It is relevant for
enabling the expansion of high-value commodities for export as well as maintaining environmental sustainability
and private sector involvement. Given the scope of PSTA 3 and the type of productivity and geographic focus that
needs to be achieved, the government’s priority is to strengthen its regulatory systems and ensure enhanced
quality of agrochemicals and seeds marketed in Rwanda that may have a positive environmental impact.

44.     Formalize the national irrigation policy. An Irrigation Master Plan (IMP) was launched in 2010,
established the baseline for the required irrigation developments, and identified the potential for


74
  Several useful documents outline the decentralization strategy with respect to the agriculture sector, including the main components,
primary challenges, “gaps,” and ongoing actions. These documents include: Review of Decentralization in Rwanda’s Agriculture Sector to
Inform the Sector Strategy 2013-2018 (prepared by Landell Mills/ Veteffect for the European Union), 2012; Progress Report of Technical
Assistance to MINAGRI in Decentralisation, prepared by Aimable Rusingizankekwe, March 2014 (this report provides the most up-to-date
assessment of progress and further operational recommendations); Supporting Fiscal Decentralisation in the Agricultural Sector
Developing Guidelines and a Training Manual for Utilization of Earmarked Grants to Districts, prepared by ETC East Africa Ltd, 2008;
Sector Policy, Planning and Budgeting Guidelines for the Agriculture Sector, prepared by MINAGRI (2008).



                                                                  77
developing irrigation infrastructure nationally. The national irrigation policy will allow operationalizing the
IMP.

45.      Develop regulations for organic agriculture, pesticide and limestone use. Since 2001, organic
agriculture has been promoted in Rwanda for crops such as apples, banana, pineapple, strawberries,
coffee, tea, avocado, passion fruit, tree tomatoes, and chili . The gross value of production of organic
agriculture is relatively small. However, given the growing demand for organic products in the U.S., the U.K.,
local markets, Europe, and South Africa, the potential for rapid growth exists. In Rwanda, organic market
initiatives fit well with government’s efforts to promote agro-business through commodity chain development,
transformation, and competitiveness of agricultural products to facilitate access to markets under PSTA 3’s
agenda. However, government policies are not per se pro-organic, but they acknowledge that organic agriculture
can play an important role side-by-side with conventional agriculture, and some of the practices promoted support
organic agriculture as demonstrated in MINAGRI’s involvement in organic farming awareness -raising, capacity
building of farmers’ organizations and certifiers, support to the certification process, and seeds/seedlings
distribution, among others.

46.      Just like other purchased inputs (seeds and fertilizers), pesticides are used by a small proportion of
farm households. Pesticides are used mainly on coffee, tea, bananas, potatoes, and horticultural crops at much
lower rates than other inputs. The low use of pesticides can be traced to demand ‐side as well as supply‐side
factors. Weak demand for pesticides results in part from farmers' poor knowledge of pest and disease control
methods, which in turn is compounded by the lack of research on chemical pest control practices. It also results
from the cost of purchased inputs and the consequent financial risk for farmers, most of whom have very low
levels of income. The limited availability of pesticides on the market stems from the difficulty of procuring
pesticides, most of which are imported.

47.      Under PSTA 3, there are plans to increase the use of improved seed, fertilizer, and pesticides, a
strategy that inevitably calls for input market development. This strategy typically begins with establishment
of an enabling policy, regulatory, and investment environment to mobilize private capital into the sector. The
importance of these improvements stems from their effects not only on reducing risks, uncertainties, and
transaction costs prevailing in the input market, but also on providing adequate incentives for increased
investment by the private sector. Rwanda has made significant strides in improving its business investment
environment as seen from the Doing Business indicators. However, additional work needs to be done to
strengthen the regulatory framework to fully actualize PSTA 3’s objectives.

48.      Develop regulations around the value chain guarantee fund. The GoR recognizes the need to
overcome small farmers’ challenges in obtaining access to credit. Investment in the sector has been shown to
be an effective instrument to alleviate poverty and enhance food security. The objectives of diversified and private
sector-led agriculture result in the need to invest in strong value chains, especially for export commodities. Thus,
the Value Chain Fund focuses on long-term, growth-oriented investments in growing and dynamic small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The required regulatory framework has already been put in place to create this
Fund.

49.     Develop the legal basis on an agricultural catalytic fund. Improving entrepreneurship is one of the
objectives of the agricultural finance SP. The GoR recognizes the need to do so with targeted interventions as
well as broad measures supporting a business-enabling environment as a whole. This will indeed involve ways to
improve private equity and access to seed capital for new ventures. As such, providing a transparent and rule-
based legal framework for the management and oversight of such a fund will be one of the critical building blocks
in achieving results and allocative efficiencies while ensuring accountability of the Fund.

50.      Agricultural Communication, Statistical Systems, M&E, and Management Information Systems.
MINAGRI’s MIS comprises three interrelated components: Monitoring and Evaluation; Agricultural
Statistical Systems; and Agricultural Communication. While each of these components has distinct roles and
technical and institutional characteristics, together they comprise an integrated MIS expected to generate
essential, reliable, and timely information that should contribute to more efficient and effective management of
the sector, which involves many actors at various levels. Until recently, MINAGRI has viewed and managed these
components in a fragmented manner. In 2011, MINAGRI carried out a major exercise to prepare a comprehensive
action plan to enhance the M&E system for the sector, reflecting a move toward a more integrated MIS approach
to supporting implementation of PSTA 2.75

51.      With the launch of PSTA 3 in 2013/14, MINAGRI management has taken various steps to further
strengthen and operationalize these three components as integrated management tools for supporting the
efficient and effective implementation of PSTA 3 programs and SPs, in support of achieving the expected
results and targets at impact, outcome, and output levels. Accordingly, MINAGRI, with DP support, took
various steps in 2014to better pinpoint and address the constraints to each of these components and the overall
system, with a focus on enhancing the M&E system. First, the RF for PSTA 3 highlights the expected results,
underlying constraints, and expected outputs of an enhanced MIS for the agriculture sector. Second, preparation
of the ASIP included formulation of a M&E framework for PSTA 3. The challenge is for MINAGRI to take the
next steps in operationalizing these enhanced frameworks in a coherent and integrated manner, and at various
levels (central MINAGRI and subnational levels).

52.      The strategic objective for the Agricultural MIS, as outlined in the RF (SP 4.4) for PSTA 3, is to
strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness, access to, and utilization of an enhanced MIS for the agriculture
sector that would contribute to enhanced evidenced-based decision making. This would involve the following
component systems (with the RF outlining relevant outcomes and outputs): i) Monitoring and Evaluation system;
ii) Agricultural Statistical System, including enhanced national food security and nutrition information system;
and iii) Agricultural Communication System. This SO is highly relevant for supporting effective implementation
of PSTA 3, with support from the PforR operation.

53.       The RF exercise included the identification of key constraints to achieving this SO. In summary:
i) Policy/strategic aspects
     a) While there is a national statistical strategy, there is no explicit agricultural statistics strategy; and
     b) There is neither a national M&E strategy nor an agricultural M&E strategy.
ii) Institutional Aspects
     a) M&E and Agricultural Statistical System: there are limited professional staff to handle a large and growing
          work program at national and subnational levels (e.g., there is one M&E specialist for the whole
          MINAGRI sector-wide M&E and reporting system, while there are separate M&E specialists assigned to
          RAB, NAEB, and for each of the three SPIUs; there is one agricultural statistician for the whole
          MINAGRI and its agencies/SPIUs, who also serves as the focal person for FAO’s Countrystat System; at
          the District, there is no M&E officer, and these tasks need to be handled by one planner and one
          statistician, both covering all sectors);
     b) The ongoing restructuring process within MINAGRI need to be completed and fully operationalized to
          enhance the roles and efficiencies of general agricultural information coordination and individual staff in
          relation to MINAGRI’s institutional requirements (in process);
     c) The multiplicity of different DP reporting requirements at the local level pose a challenge to consolidating
          common reports to facilitate decision making at various levels;


75
  For example, the following report was the result of an exercise to prepare an integrated action plan for MINAGRI’s M&E system, in
support of implementing PSTA 2: “Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the Agricultural and Animal Resources Sector,” prepared by
MINAGRI, June, 2011.

                                                                79
      d) There are inadequate periodic trainings to ensure professional and technical staff keep abreast of changing
          information technologies in relation to agricultural extension, delivery service, and emerging demand;
      e) There is a need to complete a sector M&E/MIS development process; and
      f) There is an inadequate environment for IT applications’ interconnectivity and harmonization (talking and
          linking to each other).
iii) Investment/expenditures
      a) The budget is inadequate to fulfill the full mandate and the required and growing number of tasks,
          including staff requirements;
      b) There are some constraints in adequate operational funds to conduct periodic and necessary field surveys;
          and
      c) There are constraints to purchasing the required IT tools (S/w), materials and equipment (e.g., extension
          materials, essential equipment to enable efficient and timely processing of data).

54.      Second, the recent exercise to formulate an enhanced M&E system to support the implementation
of PSTA 3 (via the ASIP) summarized the following system-related constraints these complement the
above-identified constraints arising from the RF exercise carried out by MINAGRI):76 i) there is no unified
system in place to link the various institutions/organizations performing M&E in the agriculture sector. Each
institution/organization focuses on input/output indicators as specified in its performance contracts and not
relating to PSTA 3; ii) MINAGRI functions to a certain extent as lead agency for M&E operations but does not
link them to PSTA 3 as yet. Neither does it cover the level of strategic objectives, but instead remains at an
operational level; iii) the formats used are not harmonized and are oversimplified, so questions arise as to the
validity and reliability of the collected data; and iv) M&E at all agricultural institutions suffers from shortages of
adequately trained personnel as well as of budgetary means.

55.     At the subnational level, the above M&E assessment exercise (2014) highlighted an additional set of
constraints at District and sectoral levels, which include: i) a focus on the priorities being determined at a
higher level (national and District); ii) some reliability issues in the way that crop production/productivity harvest
data are generated and reported; and iii) the diverse reporting formats used at various levels, which pose
additional challenges to reliable aggregation of production data.

56.       Gender and youth in agriculture. Rwanda’s poverty profile indicates that women are more affected
by poverty than their male counterparts: 47 percent of female-headed households are poor compared to
44.9 percent of all households, out of which 24.1 percent are extreme poor. The depth of poverty indicators
(i.e., the proportion by which poor households fall below the poverty line) shows that despite improvements,
many households in rural areas are far below the poverty line, while other households continue to be vulnerable to
shocks, particularly in the agriculture sector. The prevalence of poverty is associated with low productivity in
subsistence agriculture. Poverty is highest (77 percent) among households (often landless) that obtain more than
half their income from working on other people’s farms. The next poorest group is those with diverse livelihoods
who obtain more than 30 percent or more of their income from farm wage work (76 percent). Smallholders hold
an average of four to five plots that make up a mean land size average of approximately 0.59 ha, with a median
value of 0.33 ha. The land distribution is skewed: 36 percent of households own 6 percent of farm land, with an
average of 0.1 ha per household. Women are more likely to fall into this category. In addition, women provide the
bulk of labor in the crop sector, but function mainly at subsistence level with insufficient skills, access to markets,
and control over land and other agricultural facilities. A key challenge for EDPRS 2 is therefore to ensure that
sustained growth and poverty reduction occur nationwide and among all groups. Therefore enabling graduation
from extreme poverty, particularly in the agriculture sector, is stated as one of the priority areas of PSTA 3.

57.     Gender equity and equality have been highlighted as a foundational and cross-cutting issue under
EDPRS 2. Rwanda builds on a solid foundation, having the highest percent of women in Parliament in the world
(63 percent) and a relatively high percent of women's participation in all decision-making local government
bodies (32 percent). The GoR has made a strong commitment to gender equity and equality, and is determined to
see it well-integrated in policies and programs at all levels. The GoR is committed to placing the family at the
center of development, and as a prerequisite to achieve equitable and sustainable development for women and
men. Gender equality and family promotion are firmly entrenched in both PRSP and EDPRS 1. EDPRS 2 also
ensures that the achievements realized in the past years are sustained and that new approaches and innovations
towards family and gender are promoted. EDPRS 2 mainstreams gender and family in the planning, budgeting
and in all development programs at national and local levels. PSTA 3 sector strategies and District plans focus on
interventions that reduce poverty levels among men and women, and reduce gender-based violence, malnutrition,
and other related conflicts, at both family and community level.

58.      In the rural/agriculture sector, progress has been made towards achieving gender equality and
ratifying regional and international legal instruments to protect women’s rights . Rwanda has a legal
framework supporting gender equity and equality in the Constitution of 2003. Nevertheless, gender disparities are
still prevalent in the rural/agriculture sector. On an average, rural women have longer working hours than men.
Women’s burdens are worsened by the fact that they are involved in doing activities that are labor intensive and
time consuming, with low remuneration. Key gender issues in the agriculture sector are: i) lack of gender-related
knowledge and skills among extension workers and few female extension staff, considering the large percentage
of women farmers; ii) low literacy levels, particularly among women, limits training opportunities; iii) limited
gender-sensitive technologies; iv) organizing training and capacity-building activities as per women’s
convenience; v) lack of access to finance, marketing, and value addition opportunities due to lower levels of
education among women; and vi) gender disparities among senior staff in the agriculture sector. As a result,
women remain in subsistence agriculture; they receive low prices for their products due to lack of market and
finance. All these factors result in a vicious cycle of poverty. Thirty percent of the country’s households are
female-headed and most of them are very poor. Therefore, the strategy of mainstreaming gender in policies,
programs, projects, and activities forms a foundation for equal rights and opportunities for women and men in the
agriculture sector and rural development. MINAGRI has developed a Gender Strategy77 that describes the issues
in detail and sets out a sound agenda to address them.

59.       Youth. There are 4.1 million youth (defined as the 14-35 years old) in Rwanda, which constitutes
about 39 percent of the population. The largest age group within the overall youth group is the 14- to 19-year-
olds who comprise 14 percent of the total population. The main challenge for youth is providing employment
opportunities and the training necessary to obtain the higher-skilled jobs that will help them break out of poverty.
Many youth do not find traditional agriculture attractive and therefore seek rural off-farm employment or urban
jobs. EDPRS 2’s thematic area on youth and productivity highlights a number of youth-targeted programs. PSTA
3 further mainstreams youth involvement in agriculture. Three key program areas for youth are relevant to
achieving the growth and poverty reduction objectives of PSTA 3, namely: i) develop a TVET curriculum for
agricultural specializations; ii) target youth in entrepreneurship programs; and iii) develop an agricultural
leadership program for youth to include intensive seminars and hands-on experience in modern agriculture and
visits to selected sites in the region.

60.     Environmental mainstreaming in agriculture. Soil conservation mainstreaming through
appropriate soil conservation measures is of great importance and should be done through the promotion
of integrated soil fertility management programs combining the use of chemical and organic fertilizers to
improve productivity but also to preserve soil’s physical and chemical characteristics. The different
techniques that have been implemented, such as composting, green manure, and organic mulching, will need to be

scaled up nationally. These techniques improve soil’s organic matter content, water-holding capacity, infiltration
rate, and microorganism activity.

61.     Environmentally sound water management in irrigation schemes is very crucial to the
sustainability of these schemes, and will be accomplished through the adoption of appropriate irrigation
schedules determining the correct irrigation amount and answering the typical questions of what, when,
how, and how much to irrigate. This will lead to improved water use efficiency and avoid deep percolation and
leaching of specific nutrients that significantly harm soil over time.

62.      Environmental considerations in rural roads. The widening of roads may impact natural vegetation
and soil stability, which may lead to erosion unless proper surfacing and side drainage facilities are
provided with erosion protection measures, such as stone pitching steep slopes and providing check dams .
Some of the roads to be widened are degraded, and cross hilly terrain susceptible to landslide and marshlands,
which may have fauna and flora of ecological importance. The rehabilitation and upgrading works can involve
significant earthwork and construction of slide protection and drainage structures, as well as embankments
crossing marshlands. Potential adverse impacts include: loss of agricultural land and vegetation due to excavation
of land in road expansion and borrow areas; slope instability due to soil and water erosion and operation of
machinery; disruption of natural drainage/flow and flooding; pollution of water bodies due to improper disposal
of solid waste and spoil; and increased noise and air pollution in the vicinity of construction sites. The focus on
mitigating potential negative environmental impacts is both imperative and relevant to achieving the sustainable
growth and poverty reduction objectives of PSTA 3.

63.     Planning for climate change. Climate change, if not mitigated, remains a major risk to Rwanda’s
agriculture sector, considering that most (90 percent) of its crop and livestock production is rainfed. The
investments being made to increase area under irrigation greatly assist the sector to cope with some of the effects
of climate change. The increased adoption of hillside conservation measures and other watershed management
structures by smallholder farmers will also help in climate change mitigation. According to PSTA 3, planning for
climate change adaptation will be done in accordance to the 2011 National Strategy for Climate Change and Low
Carbon Development, with MINAGRI taking the lead. Currently the focus is on risk assessment and vulnerability
mapping through modeling and creating a robust database. Several research programs on enhancing climate
change adaptation and mitigation are also ongoing. Going forward, the greatest challenge will be to raise various
stakeholders’ awareness on climate change issues, particularly the farming community. Integration of climate
change issues in planning, research, and extension programs also remains a challenge. Thus, while efforts are
being made to integrate appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, more needs to be done in
the future to reduce and better manage climate change risk, including the inclusion of appropriate indicator(s) in
the RF to monitor the mainstreaming of climate change in the PSTA 3 program.

64.      Nutrition and household vulnerability. Food security and nutrition are key priorities for Rwanda.
A National Nutrition Policy was formally adopted in 2007. It became apparent that while poverty was falling,
changes in acute and chronic malnutrition were more intransigent. About five years ago, the government stepped
up its commitment to tackle nutritional challenges, resulting in: a Presidential Initiative that inspired a nationwide
emergency action to find and manage all cases of acute malnutrition in children (2009); multisectoral participation
and consensus around Rwanda’s First National Nutrition Summit (2009); the Second National Nutrition Summit
(2011); completion of health facility and community-level tools to more effectively promote and counsel on
Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN); development of the National Multisector Strategy to
Eliminate Malnutrition (NmSEM) (2010); a national Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Malnutrition (JAPEM 2012);
and District Plans to Eliminate Malnutrition (DPEM) in every District (2011).

65.    EICV identified that in 2012 about 460,000 households (21 percent) had poor or borderline food
consumption patterns (82,000 households (4 percent) had poor consumption patterns; 378,000 households
(17 percent) had borderline). These households are vulnerable to seasonal shortages and also have inadequate

                                                         82
provision in the case of drought or excess rainfall. Food insecurity follows a distribution similar to that of poverty
across Districts. Food insecurity is coupled not only with inadequate consumption but also with low diet diversity,
resulting in chronic malnutrition (stunting) and micronutrient deficiencies. About 43 percent of children under
five are stunted; this is highest among children aged 12 months old (at 70 percent).

66.     The 2007 Nutrition Policy and its subsequent 2013 revision recognized the need for multisectoral
ownership, coordination, and sector-specific activities linked to budgets and financial management, as well
as decentralization, equity, and gender sensitivity. MINAGRI’s 2013 Nutrition Action Plan is incorporated
into the 2013 National Nutrition Policy as strategic action 3, and the Policy is jointly owned by the Ministry of
Health, MINAGRI, and MINALOC. As noted by Minister of Health, “Chronic malnutrition is prevalent. We need
to make sure that families know what to feed their children, how to produce it and how to cook it properly.” The
Minister added that community health workers need to be trained and given nutrition tools because they play an
important role in fighting the scourge.78

67.     In EDPRS 2, food security and malnutrition are foundational issues. The identified solution is
coordinated, strengthened, and scaled-up community-based nutrition programs and information
campaigns across the country. As per EDPRS 2, reducing Rwanda’s chronic malnutrition rates for children less
than two years old (currently 47 percent) is a prerequisite for Rwanda’s continued economic and inclusive
development. Nutrition and Food Security is one of the priority areas under Rural Development Strategy (Priority
Area 2). Income generation and household food security are intertwined, as households need to be able to
generate enough money to buy nutritious and quality food. The commitment to nutrition in the country has grown
and is now reflected in all policy updates from the EDPRS 2 and PSTA 3.

68.     The National Food and Nutrition Strategic Plan 2013-2018 (NFNSP) is a five-year implementation
plan reflecting and addressing all nutrition-related problems as outlined in the recent National Food and
Nutrition Policy 2013-2018 (NFNP). As a multisectoral plan, the NFNSP, although co-owned by three
ministries,79 is being implemented with the participation of other line ministries.80 It comprises seven strategic
directions,81 of which strategic direction 3 (Improving Household Food Security) fully embodies MINAGRI’s
Nutrition Action Plan (MNAP82). The Plan has been costed at US$44.2 million.

69.     MINAGRI’s Nutrition Action Plan 2013-2018 was recently developed as part of the National Food
and Nutrition Strategic Plan 2013-2018 (NFNSP). It focuses on the agricultural perspective to addressing food
security and nutrition-related issues. MINAGRI’s MNAP includes six specific objectives underpinned by a set of
29 key interventions83 to be implemented between 2013-14 and 2017-18 inclusive. The six objectives of MNAP
are: i) Households increasingly diversify the food production; ii) Improve nutrition-related agricultural
knowledge/practices of households; iii) Income-generating capacities of food and nutrition insecure households
supported; iv) Availability, Affordability and Quality of nutritious food is increased; v) Increased access to and
use of appropriate food for the most vulnerable households; and vi) Governance of food security and nutrition
enhanced.

(MIDIMAR) and the Ministry of Youth (MINIYOUTH).
81
   The seven NFNSP’s strategic directions include: i) Food and Nutrition advocacy to sustain commitment and generate resources for
implementation, ii) Prevention of chronic malnutrition, iii) Improving household’s food security, iv) Prevention and management of all
forms of malnutrition, v) Improving food and nutrition in schools, vi) Assuring food and nutrition in emergencies and vii) Support
programs and services.

70.      Key actions recommended in PSTA 3 to address food insecurity and malnutrition build on the
above nutrition strategies, and are to: i) support households in nutritious garden practices and diversifying food
production. The kitchen garden program initiated in 2012 will be scaled up, and farmers will be encouraged to use
land around their homes to grow diverse fruits and vegetables and to adopt intercropping practices; ii) improve
nutrition-related knowledge and practices for food insecure households – kitchen gardens, intercropping and
better nutrition (including cooking demonstrations) will be promoted through extension workers, Farmer Field
Schools, Self-help Groups, District agronomists, and agricultural village promoters. MINAGRI is supporting a
multisectoral Behavioral Change Communication initiative to improve and institutionalize nutritional knowledge;
iii) develop a program of biofortified food, especially focusing on beans fortified in iron, vitamin A-rich maize,
orange sweet potato, fortified cassava, and rice; iv) continue to maintain an adequate national strategic food
reserve to address potential shocks to food supply that the market or other GoR programs cannot or have not
adequately addressed, thus helping to improve food security. This strategic food reserve should consist of selected
staples such as maize and beans; and v) strengthen Rwanda’s food security information system to bring together
quantitative information from different sources, which would be processed into indicators that will enable timely
decision making, and to consolidate data to MINIGRI and its agencies for effective monitoring.

71.      The implementation of the strategy does not consist of multisectoral coordination groups at every
level. Rather, each line ministry knows its responsibilities and accountabilities in terms of changing nutritional
status. In a sense, instead of “think globally, act locally,” this approach involves “think multisectorally, but act
sectorally.” The policy does not envisage ministries acting outside their core comparative advantage.

                       Annex 4: Detailed Description of Program Technical Soundness

1.       Summary. The technical design of PSTA 3 and the PforR operation is overall sound and
contributes to the objective of efficiently and effectively producing the key results of the Program, and
achieving the strategic development objectives and desired impacts in terms of sectoral transformation
from overall subsistence to commercial and market-oriented farming, economic growth, and poverty
reduction. The Program design is based on best practices in terms of technical standards and typology of
activities and has in fact set the standard globally for an effect model for integrated sustainable land management
in the context of small landholding farmers. Both sustainability and incentives for farmers and other key
stakeholders to engage in, embrace, and sustain productivity increases and continual income increases while
contributing to the achievement of the Program’s objectives are built into the design.

2.       A key feature contributing to the soundness of the technical design is that it is built around the key
drivers of agriculture transformation, economic growth, and poverty reduction. These key drivers include
land husbandry activities, technology, research and extension, agricultural finance, private sector value chain
development, market-oriented infrastructure, and institutional development to build the sector’s capacity to: i)
deliver in an efficient, effective, and increasingly decentralized manner enhanced by gender-responsive and
youth-friendly policies and services; and ii) provide a conducive policy and legal framework and reliable statistics
for rapid and sustainable agricultural growth.

3.      All four programs and their respective SPs were reviewed and evaluated by the World Bank’s
technical specialist on their technical soundness and their efficiency and effectiveness to contribute to the
overall achievement of the Program’s key results. The programs and SPs were all found to be technically
sound, but the review identified areas for potential strengthening and improvement. In general, MINAGRI
counterparts have welcomed the review’s constructive suggestions, and therefore, the PforR will support their
implementation as they are incorporated by the various implementing agencies.

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

4.       Summary. The design of program 1 took into account effective solutions and responses to some of
the major constraints in the sector related to: i) sustaining the productivity gains in the medium-to-long
term and expanding them to more food and export crops and livestock, which have made a significant
contribution to strong agricultural growth and raised rural incomes in the last five years; and ii) increasing
food and nutrition security for the rural population. The key outcomes from program 1 are anticipated to be: i)
soil erosion reduced and land sustainably managed; land productivity for priority crops increased; and iii) animal
productivity increased and animal products diversified. The SPs consist of soil conservation and land husbandry,
irrigation and water management, agricultural mechanization, agrochemical use and markets, and seeds and
livestock development.

5.       Soil Conservation and Land Husbandry. Given that most of Rwandan soils (90 percent) are on
hillsides and that most of the soils are old and depleted in nutrients either by erosion or overcultivation, the
achievement of PSTA 3 will be highly dependent on the effective use of soil. The programs under PSTA 3 aim
at provision of infrastructure for erosion control and rejuvenation of soil health. The GoR has developed strong
leadership in soil conservation work. The proposed investment in better understanding Rwandan soils will be
crucial to help formulation of differentiated recommendations for input use (lime and fertilizers). New
technologies that minimize soil turning and help conserve the soil moisture, like minimum tillage, and mulching
will also be key in achieving the goals of this SP. Tremendous achievements have been documented in
significantly enhancing soil conservation technologies, especially under World Bank-financed projects. These
technologies will need to be scaled up in a larger area of Rwanda. There is need for a comprehensive and
harmonized guidance on establishment and maintenance of erosion control infrastructure, and appropriate and
area-specific guidance on soil fertility management. There is plenty of technical capacity within RAB and SPIUs

                                                        85
to develop and manage erosion control and implement soil conservation programs, but this needs close integration
with research teams to remain up-to-date.

6.       Irrigation and Water Management. Most of Rwandan agriculture is rainfed and climatic and
seasonal variations negatively affect agricultural production. For this reason, PSTA 3 has set ambitious
targets of developing an additional 40,000 ha of irrigation to reach a target of an additional 63,000 ha of
irrigated land nationally. This will comprise both marshland and hillside irrigation. So far the maximum amount
of irrigation infrastructure has been developed by the GoR and has a significant amount of public good element.
Since 2008, the GoR has made irrigation development a key national priority, to achieve sustainable production
levels and to mitigate climatic shocks. Institutions and policies have been put in place gradually to work on this
key priority. As public funding will not provide irrigation for all the required irrigable land, appropriate incentives
for private sector investment in this subsector are being put in place as the private sector will play a key role in
achieving this ambitious target, especially considering that most irrigable land is privately held. Technical
capacity to develop and manage large-scale irrigation infrastructure is lacking and a lot of TA is required for the
ongoing projects. The education program on irrigation and water management is very recent in Rwanda and a
critical mass of irrigation professionals has yet to be built. The existing capacity relies heavily on the TA available
within SPIUs. Water Users Associations (WUAs) will be established (where not existing) and strengthened
through training of both male and female members.

7.      Agricultural mechanization. The total area suitable for mechanization is estimated at 1 million ha,
which represents around 60 percent of the total cultivatable area. The expectation under PSTA 3 is that
about 25 percent of Rwanda’s 2 million farmers will have their farm operations mechanized by 2017. This
means that 500,000 Rwandan farmers would either own and/or hire mechanization services. The government,
through MINAGRI, has been heavily involved in the mechanization drive since the Mechanization and Irrigation
Task Force was established in 2009. Plans are underway to hand over mechanization services to private entities
such as cooperatives or rural communities, private companies, and young professionals while stressing the need to
focus on agricultural zones where mechanization can be easily implemented and managed. Initial experience
suggests that the mechanization strategy is sound technically, but has to be expanded to include simple
mechanized tools to cater to smallholder farmers, who cannot access large-scale mechanization without financial
support from the government and/or DPs.

8.       Agrochemical use and markets. MINAGRI’s focus on increasing the adoption of improved inputs is
predicated on the belief that current fertilizer consumption is well below levels that could be profitable.
Using the value-cost (v/c)84 ratio as a measure of profitability, a combination of DAP and urea has been observed
to be more profitable than using the NPK fertilizers (17-17-17) that have traditionally been recommended in the
past. In general, fertilizer could be used profitably in a wider range of zones and communes in the production of
maize, sorghum, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, and climbing beans as well as for irrigated rice, horticultural crops
such as cabbage, and inoculated soybeans. Although there is substantial potential for profitably increasing
fertilizer use in Rwanda, it is important to identify crop/zone combinations where fertilizer is not profitable and
avoid them.

9.       Seed development. Scientific and technical development of agricultural and animal resources in Rwanda
to improve the livelihoods of low-income farmers prior to July 2011 was mandated to the Rwanda Agricultural
Research Institute. The institute carried out research and promoted technologies in crop production, livestock,
forestry, agroforestry, post-harvest management, land conservation, and water management. Since 2011, these
research areas have continued under the Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) and are grouped under three main
program areas: crops, livestock, and natural resources management. Some progress has been made at the national

84
   Value cost ratio (v/c) is defined as the value of additional production obtained from using fertilizer divided by the cost of the fertilizer
treatment. A v/c ratio >2 is generally considered an adequate incentive for fertilizer adoption; it means that the financial returns to using
fertilizer are two times greater than the cost.

                                                                     86
level to support seed sector development. In 2004, stakeholders formed the Seed Traders Association of Rwanda
(STAR) upon the recommendation of the East African Seed Committee (EASCOM). Following the development
of a seed policy in 2007 to define the roles of various stakeholders in the seed value chain, a seed master plan
involving main stakeholders of the seed chain was developed and adopted in 2008.

10.     To produce, conserve, and treat seeds to be kept safely for a long time, a Rwanda Seeds Enterprise (RSE)
was established in 2010. Beyond these national endeavors, RAB’s Seed Project program has formed strategic
alliances with various continental and regional bodies to add value to their activities. RAB links up with NEPAD
and COMESA frameworks. Within EAC, RAB collaborates with ECAPAPA (Eastern and Central Africa
Programmes for Agricultural Policy Analysis) and ASARECA (Association for Strengthening Agricultural
Research in Eastern and Central Africa) for harmonizing Rwanda seed policies. It is also involved in the EAC
seeds standards harmonization effort being led by RBS. Rwanda is also a member of African Regional Intellectual
Property Organization (ARIPO). In other words, Rwanda has laid the foundation for establishing a technically
sound seed sector linked to regional and subregional initiatives. These roles and arrangements are being reflected
in a new seeds policy currently under discussion.

11.     Livestock Development. For the livestock sector, PSTA 3 and its overall results chain are technically
sound and most of the proposed indicators would measure well the progress towards achieving PSTA 3’s strategic
objectives and the PforR operational results. The growth of some subsectors of animal production (such as dairy)
has been impressive in the past 15 years, demonstrating a sound strategy and overall good implementation. It is
worth noting that the lack of lands and pasture as well as availability and accessibility of feed are identified as key
bottlenecks to livestock intensification and productivity increase in the country.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

12.     Summary. The key outcomes of program 2 are: i) improved technologies which are responsive to
Rwanda’s agro-ecological potential, men and women farmers’ needs and resources, and market prospects; ii)
enhanced integrated and market-oriented extension and advisory services which result in higher proportion of
farmer adoption of improved technologies, for both men and women; and iii) strengthened inclusive and business-
oriented farmers’ cooperatives/organizations with enhanced entrepreneurial skills for effective engagement in
input and output markets. The SPs are: i) research and technology transfer; ii) extension and proximity services
for producers; and iii) farmers’ cooperatives and organizations.

13.     The program and SPs were analyzed and reviewed and found to be sound technically based on
good research, extension, and strengthening of farmers’ cooperatives’ practices. The outcomes and
associated outputs and key activities were also assessed and found to form the relevant results chain, which
contributes to the key productivity and commercialization objectives of the Program. Additionally, areas for
increased effectiveness in design and implementation were identified.

14.      Research. Prior to July 2011, the Rwanda Agricultural Research Institute (French acronym ISAR)
was mandated with conducting scientific and technical development of agricultural and animal resources in
Rwanda to improve the livelihoods of low-income farmers. The institute carried out research and promoted
technologies in crop production, livestock, forestry, agroforestry, post-harvest management, land conservation,
and water management. These research areas have continued under RAB, with the research grouped under three
main program areas: crops, livestock, and natural resources management. The research is being conducted
through multidisciplinary teams and has moved away from traditional research-extension linear processes to
Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D), based on an “innovation platforms approach.” In this
system, the stakeholders (farmers, scientists, traders, local authorities, NGOs and the private sector) are becoming
increasingly involved in the research process, from priority setting and technology development to technology
transfer. However, the value chain approach, which is central in PSTA 3, has yet to be fully integrated in some
research activities. Efforts have also been made to strike a balance between the three program areas, although the

                                                          87
crop program remains the largest in resource allocation. Increasingly, the research program is also embracing
cross-cutting issues such as climate change adaptation and mitigation. The research program is therefore found to
be technically sound and in line with the objectives of the PSTA 3 program. Nevertheless, the research programs
cost-effectiveness and efficiency would be further improved by enhanced collaboration with other regional
research programs, especially in the other East African countries. This collaboration will: allow more resources to
be devoted to adaptive research; enhance specialization; and reduce initial basic research costs.

15.       Extension and proximity services for producers are key interventions implemented under the CIP.
The CIP is based on three pillars: i) land use consolidation; ii) improved seed and fertilizer use; and iii)
proximity of extension service to farmers. RAB and Districts have adopted a Farmer Field Schools (FFS)
approach, which emphasizes farmer-to-farmer extension. In the changing context for rural smallholders where no
blanket recommendations exist in agriculture and collective action is required to access markets, farmers need to
organize, be innovative, and be able to adjust to changing situations. In this context, FFS have an important role to
fill in the development of locally-based innovations, to create knowledge for a framework of action, and to boost
local management and leadership skills, aspects not normally catered to in regular training and extension based on
technology transfer concepts. The FFS process has been shown to build self-confidence (particularly for women),
to encourage group control of the process, and to build group and management skills. Farmer-led FFS have also
been a common strategy both for scaling-up FFS interventions and for cost reduction in both Asia and Africa.
Efforts have been made to compare FFS costs versus other methods of extension but the comparisons fall short
due to the difficulties in comparing outcomes of the investments, particularly in relation to aspects of
empowerment, which are very difficult to value. Thus, despite the challenges that accompany FFS in general, the
Rwandan model is found to work well and is technically sound, especially given the past recorded productivity
gains, strong government support both at national and local levels, and its effective dovetailing with other
government community initiatives. However, given the shift in emphasis to a value chain approach and the need
to commercialize agriculture, there is need to focus more on capacity building for both farmers’ groups, service
providers, extension staff, and other key stakeholders on business development services.

16.      Farmers’ cooperatives and organizations. This SP builds on the successful development of farmers’
cooperatives under PSTA 2, and ongoing flagship projects in the sector such as LWH and RSSP 3. Five key
objectives highlighted in PSTA 3 are to: i) develop management and entrepreneurial capacities in farmers’
cooperatives and organizations; ii) support farmers’ organizations’ participation in activities of higher value, both
at the farm level and in post-harvest handling and agroprocessing; iii) develop farmers’ organizations as vehicles
to improve farmers’ access to inputs in a demand-driven way; iv) develop rural women’s organizations and
groups within cooperatives; and v) promote the growth of social capital to provide farmers’ organizations with an
enduring foundation for the longer run.

17.      To achieve the above objectives, six lines of actions are being carried out: i) encourage farmers to
form new cooperatives in new markets to increase the number to 2,500 cooperatives; ii) train cooperative
members in management, organization, and entrepreneurial skills to increase the proportion of cooperatives
trained from 30 percent in 2013 to 60 percent by 2018; iii) facilitate and train cooperative members in post-
harvest handling and agroprocessing techniques and facilitate the entry of cooperatives into these markets; iv)
increase the proportion of cooperatives that procure farm inputs for their members from 15 percent in 2013 to 45
percent in 2018, through facilitation and training; v) increase the volume of agricultural credit accessed by
cooperative members from RwF 373 million in 2013 to RwF 560 million in 2018; and vi) increase the number of
cooperative members accessing agricultural insurance from 20,238 in 2013 to 200,000 in 2018. In all of these
activities, efforts will be made to ensure adequate attention is given to involving/supporting women members.

18.      PSTA 3 has not fully captured experience on farmer empowerment and institutions on the ground,
and as a result, this is not fully reflected in the ASIP . There is need for harmonization of various approaches
(within SPs 2.2 and 2.3 – extension and farmers’ organization) as well as ensuring participatory and bottom-up
institutional structure of the cooperatives. While the farmer-to-farmer approach is well recognized by PSTA 3,

                                                         88
there are currently variations within several programs in MINAGRI, RAB, and the SPIUs. Lessons and insights
highlighted in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of RSSP 2 (2012) should guide the harmonization of
the approach and quality of these entities. Also, section 2.3.1 of PSTA 3 talks about the key pillars for rapid sector
growth, which include soft skills and farmer capacity; to support this pillar, it talks about the focus area of
“professionalization of farmers, reorientation incentives in agricultural extension, privatization and extension to
cover business advisory services and marketing assistance.” The professionalization of farmers is critical for
increasing production and commercialization.

19.      MINAGRI has already addressed the key issues of harmonization of various approaches and the
bottom-up institutional model of cooperatives as part of the Ag. PforR preparation, and a policy on the
institutional aspects of farmers’ organizations and farmer-to-farmer extension systems has been approved
in principle by the Cabinet. The new model starts with the farmer at the community level and is supported
through the village to the national level by technical committees. It consists of a two-pronged approach: Self-help
Groups (SHG) to cooperative model and farmer-to-farmer extension. MINAGRI is in the process of developing
an operational plan on how to integrate FFS and other existing systems. This institutional framework is critical to
ensuring that farmers’ organizations and cooperatives are inclusive, participatory, gender- and youth-sensitive,
and sustainable and include the bottom 50 percent of households. This inclusive institutional framework for
farmers’ organizations/cooperatives is important not only for poverty reduction, but also for commercialization of
production and private sector development. The details of the policy note are being worked out, and will be
finalized as part of Ag. PforR preparation by appraisal. It builds on the lessons and experiences of the flagship
LWH and RSSP 3 projects and other good practices in the sector.

20.      The new approach calls for systematic mobilization and institution building and a decentralized
approach to empower Districts and to devolve decision-making management and implementation of
agricultural activities to the village level. It recommends SHGs (15-20 farmers) as the foundation for
institutional development. Each SHG selects a group leader whose main role is to guide and supervise the group
members in uptake of good agronomic practices. One farmer promoter is selected per village and trained in
practical skills (related to crops) as well as in soft skills of planning and communication, to enhance his/her ability
to act as an extension agent for other farmers in the village.

21.      The key challenges now are to operationalize the new approach and mobilize necessary technical
assistance required to build capacity at the farmer and staffing level to implement the new policy . Some of
the questions to be addressed during next few months are: i) What happens to the 1,877 cooperatives already
established and functioning? Would these cooperatives be restructured as per the new policy?; ii) Do the District
and national teams that have been formed as core teams for technical support have necessary knowledge and
expertise to provide technical assistance and monitor the performance of the cooperatives?; iii) What package of
TA would be required to achieve outcomes and results as envisioned by the program? This requires reviewing
what has already been done by the LWH and RSSP projects, identifying gaps, and finalizing a capacity-building
plan; v) What role would the Trainer of Trainers (TOT) have?; and vi) Regarding the farmer-to-farmer extension
model operating for the last three seasons, what lessons have been learned and how can this model be further
improved to ensure that it is self-sustaining? (i.e., the role of farmer-to-farmer extension should be
institutionalized so that the District and national teams can focus on monitoring their performance, identifying
gaps, and providing technical assistance).

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

22.     Summary. The key outcomes of program 3 are: i) enhanced business environment for expanded
agricultural investments and value addition; and ii) competitive and private sector-driven value chain
development and expanded commercialization of production for domestic and export markets, enabled by
expanded access to finance, more efficient and effective agricultural marketing systems, and improved
rural infrastructure. The SPs are: i) creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage

                                                          89
entrepreneurship and facilitate market access; ii) development of priority value chains: food and export crops,
dairy and meat, fisheries, apiculture (5 SPs); iii) agricultural finance; and iv) market-oriented infrastructure for
post-harvest handling and storage.

23.     The program and SPs were analyzed, reviewed, and found to be technically sound based on the
results chain for each SP strategic objective including the outcomes, outputs, and proposed activities to
accomplish the outputs. Areas for increased effectiveness in design and implementation were identified.

24.      Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate
market access. The specific objectives of increasing overall production, productivity, and value addition in target
value chains as well as creating an enabling environment conducive to increased private sector participation are
well aligned with the set target for increasing the value of exports in priority value chains by 28 percent p.a. by
2018. However, more in-depth understanding needs to be developed in terms of mid-term market demand
dynamics expected for each value chain as well as a clearer prioritization among the various levers available to
the government (i.e., expansion, intensification, value addition) to achieve the set export growth target in a
sustainable way. How much of this target will come from intensification and how much is expected from
expansion in terms of contribution to achieving the targets? Early engagement with the private sector suggests
intensification should be considered as a first priority over expansion given Rwanda’s land constrained
environment, particularly for expansion of well-established, more traditional export value chains (tea and coffee).
Intensification efforts could very well be supplemented by expansion based on a clear value proposition for
farmers in target areas.

25.      Development of priority food crop value chains. Promotion of the eight priority food crops (bananas,
wheat, maize, rice, Irish potatoes, cassava, soya beans, and beans) is of critical importance to food security and
nutrition, growth, and poverty reduction. The emphasis of the value chain approach is found to be best, especially
since most farmers have started to produce surpluses for the market after satisfying their consumption needs.
However, it is important to note that taking a value chain approach involves addressing the major constraints and
opportunities faced by businesses at multiple levels of a given value chain. This can include a wide range of
activities, such as facilitating access to cheaper or better inputs, strengthening the delivery of business and
financial services, increasing access to higher-value markets, or simplifying export licensing. Furthermore, a
value chain approach requires capacity building for farmers and other service providers such as extension agents
to ensure there is an orientation towards “farming as a business” rather than for subsistence. Some of these
ingredients of a value chain approach are found to be weak or lacking currently. Going forward there is need to
undertake comprehensive value chain analyses of the eight priority food crops to identify the gaps and develop an
action plan on how to fill these gaps. Apart from the domestic market, regional markets also need to be studied to
better understand their needs and constraints.

26.      Development of priority export value chains. More clarity is needed on areas in which FDI is required
and in what volume to achieve export value chain targets. For example, in the horticulture export value chain,
serious inflows of FDI will be required as a necessary condition for meeting the ambitious export growth targets
set for this relatively small but emerging export subsector. Success in this area will hinge on addressing
infrastructure and logistics challenges (e.g., cold chain) and successfully identifying promising PPP and
greenfield investment opportunities. For the tea, coffee, and horticulture subsectors the expectation is that the
market can absorb the increased export volumes planned. In the pyrethrum subsector, the market dynamics need
to be better researched and understood to allow for a proper validation of the feasibility of the targets set. For all
these export subsectors, the target areas for planned expansion of production need to be reviewed from a poverty
reduction and social risk standpoint as they involve farmers switching from predominantly food crops to cash
crops. Intensive training support will be required as these farmers move into producing new crops for which they
lack experience.



                                                         90
27.      When considering the objective of increased commercialization of export value chains and the need for
considerable private sector investment to achieve subsector targets by 2018, there is a need for stronger
involvement of the private sector, both in-country and other potential investors in the planning and
implementation stage to clarify how these objectives can best be achieved and the best division of labor between
the government and private sector. Building on the private sector consultation (held on March 27, 2014), further
validating PSTA 3’s RF with a select group of private sector operators in each sector is a recommended first step.

28.      Development of Priority Value Chains: Dairy, Meat, Fisheries and Apiculture. The overall approach
for the development of these four value chains is technically sound, with focus on feed-producing and -processing
infrastructures (with strong private sector involvement), but also development or enhancement of the legal and
policy framework and SPS standards. However, it is not clear how indicators related to increased revenue for
value added of the value chains’ products will be monitored and the implementation arrangements for the
different activities need to be better described.

29.     Moreover, parts of the Strategic Plan and its RF require further work to make them consistent with the
overall objectives of PSTA 3, implementable, and easier to monitor. These include: i) better describing the section
on “improved control of animal diseases,” including using a pre-operational tool such as the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE) Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) pathway; ii) improving the baseline data and
source/methodology of the indicators; and iii) avoiding discrepancy and contradictions between this SP and SP1.6
(Livestock Development) and their respective activities.

30.      Agricultural Finance. The action items to achieve expanded and inclusive access to viable agriculture
loans and enhanced recovery rates include: i) developing a national agricultural finance policy; ii) developing a
warehouse receipts (WRS) act and regulations; iii) M&E of existing agricultural financial instruments; iv)
constructing warehouses; v) MINAGRI facilitating a value chain finance relationship through contract farming;
vi) MINAGRI, in collaboration with agriculture financial stakeholders, establishing and convening agricultural
finance forums; vii) MINAGRI, in collaboration with other stakeholders, providing specialized training for bank
officers in providing credit to agriculture, including support in preparation of business plans; and viii) MINAGRI,
in collaboration with other stakeholders, raising public awareness of available financing instruments. These
actions are comprehensive and well-targeted, however they may fall short of achieving the indicated outcome due
to the following reasons: a) many of the action items require development of policies and national plans that will
inform more detailed actions later on, but by themselves will not help reach the indicated targets; b) it is not clear
whether WRS is the main mechanism that would increase loans by the banks to the agriculture sector (which is
the only specific action proposed in addition to stakeholder development and capacity building). With the existing
data and information in the financial sector, it is not yet possible to assume that the warehouse receipts act and
regulations, by itself, will more than double the loans extended to agriculture; c) support to warehouse
infrastructure assumes the lack of storage capacity to be the main reason for the absence of a functioning WRS.
There is also an assumption that government funding is required to improve this capacity. Both assumptions are
currently unfounded, as no demand and feasibility analyses exist for WRS in Rwanda; and d) facilitating value
chain finance relationship through contract farming is a vague action item. Further specificity is required on these
four areas to strengthen the results chain to achieve the desired results and targets.

31.     Although somewhat vague/high-level, increasing access to sustainable agriculture and livestock
insurance, the main assumption (that agricultural insurance requires an enabling framework and premium
subsidy) is correct. In addition, action items that will likely help implement the policy framework include: i)
developing an index-based crop yield insurance tracking system; ii) developing an M&E framework for
agriculture and livestock insurance progress and impact; and iii) increasing public awareness of agriculture and
livestock insurance.




                                                         91
32.      The outcome of expanded, targeted, agricultural savings mobilization through strengthened SACCOs and
other appropriate financial institutions directly ties into the experience of a well-studied and -performed savings-
linked input financing program. As such, targeting its expansion with the provided targets is technically
reasonable. However, the action items in the results chain (as listed below) should make more explicit references
to the required actions and next steps and the reasons for the identification of the target based on the available
experience with this program. Action items in the results chain include: i) monitoring and impact assessment of
financial education in rural areas; ii) financial education campaigns; and iii) training of financial institutions to
develop innovative savings products that meet the specific needs of the rural population.

33.     Market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest. Promote efficient and equitable transport systems.
MINAGRI, the lead institution for feeder rural roads investments, has prepared a common framework of
engagement. The lead technical institution for roads development, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA),
has prepared a Transport Sector Master Plan that provides strategic direction for development of feeder rural
roads throughout the country. A comprehensive feeder roads development strategy and program that provides the
framework for prioritization of investments, maintenance of feeder roads, and definition of the institutional
arrangements is currently under preparation. The National Transport Sector Policy (December 2008) identifies the
important role transport plays in stimulating economic growth by increasing internal production and facilitating
access to domestic and international markets, while ensuring favorable conditions for provision and distribution of
imported products within the country. Emphasis is placed on the development of transport infrastructure and
services, in terms of construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of transportation networks, aimed at growth
and economic development to achieve the objectives of Vision 2020. The transport policy identifies the need to
reduce constraints to transport to promote sustainable economic growth and decrease poverty.

34.      Rwanda has a road network of about 19,055 km, of which about 15,055 km is classified, and consists of:
1,211 km and 58 km paved national and District roads, respectively; 1,538 km unpaved national roads; and
12,248 km unpaved District roads. The unclassified roads network is estimated at about 4,000 km, which are
predominantly very low engineering standard earth roads, and principally constitute the feeder rural road network.
However, these roads are in dismal state, and represent a major constraint to the mobility of the rural population
and agricultural inputs and marketable surplus outputs. Farmers’ transport to markets relies predominantly on
human transport and Intermediate Means of Transport (IMT). Thus, with limited resources, investment in rural
roads should be prioritized by the roads’ ability to connect areas of economic growth. As a result of insufficient
maintenance and inadequate drainage, only about 15 percent85 of the classified District roads are in good and fair
condition, while about 50 percent of the national network in general is in good and fair condition. However, about
95 percent86 of the paved road network in Rwanda is in good and fair condition as a result of the intensive road
rehabilitation works carried out over the last decade. The strategy and targets of the medium-cost scenario for
PSTA 3 to construct 11,000 km of feeder rural roads and maintain an additional 1,500 km are both technically
sound and strategically imperative for securing efficient access of more inputs and production to markets.

35.      Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level. Post-harvest activities
mostly occur before consumption. These include primary handling (drying, threshing, shelling, winnowing,
sorting), aggregation and transportation, storage and speculation, marketing, and processing. In general, cereals
and legumes are not particularly perishable products, but losses can occur along the post-harvest value chain.
Reducing post-harvest losses (quantitative or qualitative losses resulting in a measurable decrease in monetary
value) can increase the volume and value of staple crops within the market and available for consumption. To
reduce post-harvest losses and at the same time improve intertemporal food consumption, the GoR initiated
strategic grain reserve activities in 2010. MINAGRI purchased approximately 7,000 metric tons (MT) of maize
and 3,000 MT of beans from Season A production. In 2011, the Post-Harvest Taskforce purchased about 60,000
MT of maize and beans as a strategic food reserve with a potential to reach 200,000 MT. The Post-Harvest

Taskforce within MINAGRI has oversight and responsibility for the reserve activities. These efforts provide a
firm foundation and are technically sound for the management of post-harvest loses.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

36.      Summary. The key outcomes of program 4 are: i) enhanced capacity of the sector to deliver
efficient and effective agricultural services; and ii) an enhanced policy environment for enabling rapid and
sustainable agricultural growth. The SPs are: i) institutional capacity building; ii) decentralization in
agriculture; legal and regulatory framework; iii) agricultural communication statistical systems, M&E and
knowledge management; iv) gender and youth in agriculture; v) environmental mainstreaming in agriculture; and
vi) nutrition and household vulnerability .

37.      The program and SPs were reviewed and assessed and found to be sound technically and of
sufficient design to be able to deliver on the key results and outcomes. Additionally, potential areas that could
benefit from strengthening were identified.

38.      Institutional Capacity Building. Based on the PforR assessment mission findings and various recent
capacity development diagnostic assessments and their corresponding recommendations,87 the assessment of this
capacity development SP concludes the following main points: i) there are adequate recent assessments of the
capacity priority needs and required strengthening actions of MINAGRI and its main agencies (RAB, NAEB) to
carry out the proposed PSTA 3 Ag. PforR support operation. While there have been some assessments of the
District capacities to formulate and implement agricultural programs, these have been limited in scope and depth.
Nonetheless, there are several recent assessments supported by the EU, for both overall District capacities and
agricultural-specific 88 capacities and required priority actions (2013 and 2014), also as part of support for
enhanced decentralization efficiencies and effectiveness; ii) in addition, there is a forthcoming exercise (later in
2014) for a MINAGRI/District Working Group to carry out an exercise that would consolidate and update the
priority capacity needs and strengthening actions, with special reference to ensuring the effective implementation
of key actions that will help achieve the proposed outcomes and outputs and targets of PSTA 3 as articulated in
the RF; iii) the RF for this SP, including its underlying results chain, is technically sound. Generally, it reflects
and builds upon the above-mentioned evidenced-based diagnostic assessments and action plans in specifying
appropriate interventions that will generate priority outputs and contribute to strategic outcomes outlined for the
decentralization SP; it also supports the outcomes of other SPs that involve enhanced services to farmers. At the
same time, the results chain can be further strengthened by incorporating the results of the proposed forthcoming
updated capacity needs and action plan exercise cited above; iv) both RAB and NAEB are updating their strategic
plans with the aim of strengthening their presence and role at the subnational level, while recognizing the
expanded role of and need for strengthening planning and implementation and M&E capacities at the District
level; and v) MINAGRI and its agencies generally have: a weak M&E system in terms of each entity lacking a
well-designed and functional M&E system, with corresponding “SMART” indicators, with their updated baseline
and target figures; and an absence of an overall integrated and functional M&E system for the agriculture sector,
with limited evidenced-based analysis to help inform decision making. The ASIP includes support for an
enhanced integrated M&E system.

39.      Decentralization in Agriculture. PSTA 3’s proposed SP on Decentralized Agricultural Services, and its
articulation in the RF is technically sound. The four components are appropriately linked to each other and
87
   Agriculture Sector Capacity Building Plan: 2013- 2018 (MINAGRI, RAB, NAEB), prepared by the Govt. of Rwanda Public Service
Commission (2013); Capacity Needs Assessment for MINAGRI, prepared by Coffey International Development, July 2013.

   See above footnote for detailed references. In addition, there is a useful assessment exercise which includes relevant recommendations
for enhancing the program cycle (and can provide useful inputs for the proposed capacity development assessment exercise (see below):

USAID), 2014.

together will contribute to the envisioned decentralization SOs. A clear decentralization strategy and road map (as
reflected in the Decentralization Implementation Plan (DIP)) is propelling progressive increases in fiscal
decentralization to the 30 Districts. Ongoing reforms of MINAGRI and its agencies/units (RAB, NAEB, and the
three SPIUs) will further integrate its centralized structure and staff increasingly into the subnational structure
(especially at the District level) and its modus operandi in the provision of expanded, enhanced-quality
agricultural services. These will be accompanied by specific capacity development (CD) programs and
interventions, although there is a need to further strengthen these activities at the District and sector levels. There
will be expanded participation and transparency at the District levels, although these aspects are at an early stage.
The recent planned improved harmonization and strengthening of M&E systems at the national/MINAGRI and
District levels, including the introduction of multi-stakeholder/client surveys and other tools at the District level,
will contribute to much needed improvements in the governance and accountability aspects of implementing
agricultural programs at the District level, including enhanced utilization of earmarked funds (which has been one
of the identified weaknesses). These improvements, in turn, will contribute to enhanced performance and results.

40.     Legal and Regulatory Framework. Formalize the national irrigation policy. An Irrigation Master Plan
(IMP) was launched in 2010, established the baseline of the required irrigation developments, and identified the
potential for developing irrigation infrastructure nationally. The national irrigation policy will allow
operationalizing the IMP. Both the IMP and the national irrigation policy are technically sound and provide both
the framework and foundation for implanting key investments in this subsector.

41.      Develop regulations for organic agriculture, pesticides and limestone use. Laws and regulations have
direct consequence for inputs marketing, including registration procedures, packaging and labeling requirements,
quality control measures (e.g., pre-shipment inspection and final retail inspection and enforcement) but these are
critically inadequate currently. The Rwanda Seed Law n°14/2003 was promulgated on May 23, 2003, and six
Ministerial Orders (or regulations) related to seeds adopted (the most recent one in 2011), while a national seed
policy was promulgated in October 2007. The law is under review consistent with the EAC harmonization
protocols and contains Plant Breeders Rights (PBR). Most recently Rwanda actively participated in the
harmonization of EAC seeds standards, which are now under public review before they are signed by the EAC
Council of Ministers for adoption by the individual member states. Rwanda has yet to ratify the EAC Sanitary and
Phytosanitary (SPS) protocols. Once ratified, a Presidential Order would be needed for implementation. A
developed crops protection law has been in Parliament for approval for about seven years now.

42.      Rwanda developed a fertilizer policy in 2007, but it is largely about the increased use of chemical
fertilizers without any recommendations and actions targeting the better use of organic fertilizers. Such
recommendations are important to improve extension systems to create farmers’ awareness on the importance of
organic fertilizer, demonstrate better methods of producing and applying organic manure, reinforce investment in
soil erosion control measures particularly radical terraces that are efficient, and reinforce integration of livestock
production with crop production so that animal manure can be used for crop production and crop byproducts can
act as feed for animals. Currently, MINAGRI is finalizing a more comprehensive fertilizer policy that aims to
address these gaps.

43.      Organic farming is not completely new in Rwanda, as most Rwandan farmers use little or no chemicals
in farming and could be classified as organic farmers. Officially, however, only those who consciously use
organic inputs and certify their products are designated as such. Many farmers are being trained either as
individuals or farmers’ associations by NGOs (e.g., Gako Training Center) in organic farming practices including
certification. Rwanda did not have any standards for organic products until the adoption of the East African
Organic Product Standards in 2007. That notwithstanding, Rwandan organic products meant for export are
certified to the EU regulation and in a few cases also to the US. There is need to regulate the system but given the
limited size of organic agriculture and the low level of awareness among Rwandans, it may be important to first
investigate whether the potential benefits of introducing the regulations outweigh the combined cost of resources
needed to develop and implement them before moving ahead.

44.      Develop regulations around the value chain guarantee fund. The technical assessment showed that a
new fund may not resolve the current challenges of developing value chains. Indeed it would be more efficient to
restructure the Business Development Fund (BDF) and include a focus on value chain development. The BDF is
an independent company created in collaboration of the GoR and the Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD) to
help SMEs access finance. It has four categories: i) an Agriculture Guarantee Fund that will cover any productive
projects developed in agricultural value chains; ii) an SME Guarantee Fund aimed at guaranteeing loans made by
participating financial institutions within the framework of promoting SMEs in Rwanda (any productive
investment other than in the agriculture sector); iii) a Women’s Guarantee Fund aimed at promoting women; and
iv) a Retrenched Civil Servants Guarantee Fund that intervenes when borrowers do not have sufficient collateral
to cover the whole risk of Participating Financial Institutions (PFI). The Agriculture Guarantee Fund of the BDF
has the mandate to support the development of value chains. But due to inadequate funding, low private sector
participation in activities that should be their responsibility, and lack of coordination between stakeholders, the
Fund has not been able to achieve its objective. Institutional capacity appears weak in terms of coordination,
staffing, planning, and capacity to prepare technical specifications documents. The recommendation is to evaluate
the current challenges and obstacles of the current Agriculture Fund and restructure it to carry out the functions
and objectives of value chain financing.

45.     Develop the legal basis for an agricultural catalytic fund. While developing the legal basis for an
agricultural catalytic fund is an important next step towards diversifying the sources and methods of financing for
new ventures and increased entrepreneurship, any effort in this space should be accompanied and to some extent
preceded by a clear demand assessment to clarify the fund’s objectives and inform its legal and regulatory
requirements.

46.      Agricultural communication statistical systems, M&E and knowledge management. Based on PSTA
3’s RF, the strategic objective of the MIS (and component M&E, Stat. Systems and Agric. Communication) is to
strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness, access to, and utilization of an enhanced MIS for the agriculture sector
that would contribute to enhanced evidenced-based decision making. This would involve the following
component systems (with the RF outlining relevant outcomes and outputs): i) Monitoring and Evaluation system;
ii) Agricultural Statistical System, including enhanced national food security and nutrition information system;
and iii) Agricultural Communication System.

47.      Based on information provided in the RF, the overall SO and supporting details (of outcomes, outputs,
indicators, baselines, and targets) are sound, although they need to be further operationalized at national and
subnational levels. The proposed evaluation framework for PSTA 3 prepared as part of the ASIP document (June,
2014) needs to be further harmonized and aligned with the RF, as well as further simplified and operationalized (a
large number of indicators require disaggregated data that are currently not available; therefore, the gap between
the “ideal” and the “feasible” needs to be bridged, something that perhaps can be done in a phased manner as the
statistical systems are strengthened).

48.      The RF outlines five sound outcomes for the MIS (with corresponding indicators, baselines, and targets,
and specific outputs/supporting activities): i) improved M&E System for Agriculture Sector, leading to better and
more timely decisions at management level; ii) harmonized and accessible Agricultural Statistical System to
support evidenced-based decision making (ref. to planning, budgeting, implementation, M&E); iii) enhanced
operational food nutrition and security information system to support better decision making; iv) enhanced
agricultural communications: agricultural information is collected, managed, enriched, and placed at the disposal
of all actors of the agricultural development of the country; and v) strengthened MIS for Agriculture Sector,
resulting in better and more timely decision making by key actors.

49.      Gender and youth in agriculture. The overall goal of the gender strategy is to contribute to poverty
reduction and sustainable development through institutionalization of gender-responsive programming,
implementation, monitoring, and reporting systems and improved gender equality in the agriculture sector. For
MINAGRI, the strategic objective is to improve gender equality in the agriculture sector and redress existing
disparities. The Ministry’s strategy aims at mainstreaming gender within MINAGRI’s institutional and
operational framework. The following are key actions recommended by PSTA 3, and elaborated in the gender
strategy to achieve gender equity: i) institutionalize gender equality in the agriculture sector (all entities should
have at least 30 percent representation by women); ii) develop capacities for gender-sensitive programming; iii)
enhance gender-responsiveness in agricultural service delivery; iv) promote equal participation in decision-
making processes; and v) continue to develop, strengthen, and operationalize partnerships with gender-focused
institutions.

50.      The Gender Strategy and Action Plan is comprehensive and includes interventions in each of the above
five priority areas. PSTA 3 has included two gender objectives: i) to institutionalize gender-responsive
programming and implementation; and ii) to improve gender equality in the agriculture sector, to contribute to
increased income from agriculture for male and female farmers. While the gender strategy and action plan are
quite detailed in recommending key implementation actions, some of the observations and/or focus areas that
need attention and should become part of ASIP are: i) gender and inclusion are very closely interlinked. One of
the important outcomes of EDPRS 2 is a 10 percent reduction (from 24 percent) of extreme poor and these are
mostly women-headed households, those with stunted children, and those with very small landholdings. Income
generation and household food security are intertwined, as households need to be able to generate enough money
to buy nutritious and quality food. This would necessitate more income-generating opportunities for women to
help them out of extreme poverty; ii) gender needs to be mainstreamed across various SPs (e.g., related to water
and irrigation management, access to finance, technology and research, farmers’ cooperatives, extension, feeder
roads, etc.); iii) gender mainstreaming in agriculture remains a challenge due to the lack of female extension
agents and Local Service Providers (LSPs) to mainstream and monitor gender aspects. While training modules are
available, TOTs have limited capacity to provide services at the “last mile.” It would be useful to revisit the
interventions to ensure that the capacity issue at each level is addressed and reflected in the ASIP and budget, and
monitored and evaluated; iv) mapping and targeting methodology needs to be revisited/refined to ensure that all
SPs address the needs of targeted households (in collaboration with the National Women Council); v) a strong
M&E system with a robust baseline and tracking system needs to be institutionalized. Currently, this is lacking
and the numbers do not reflect gender; this area needs more attention going forward; vi) gender-sensitive targets
are needed in SP areas (e.g., how many women benefit from various programs?); vii) SPs’ activities on gender
included in the RF and ASIP do not seem adequate to achieve the above objectives and outcomes; and viii) focus
should be placed on promoting off-farm jobs for women, sensitizing women to the anticipated transformation of
agriculture, formal cross-border trade, cooperatives and off-farm.

51.     There is little discussion of the local-level farmer/community institutions that would play a critical role in
addressing gender issues. These should be the champions and promoters of gender equality at the community
level.

52.     Environmental Mainstreaming in Agriculture. Soil conservation mainstreaming. Mainstreaming
environmental management in soil conservation and irrigation practices being undertaken in PSTA 3 are key for
sustainability of the various investments and for the environment. They are necessary to maintain and restore
ecosystems so they are as close as possible to their natural state. The GoR has put in place sound and strong
environmental governance structures and systems which are also rooted throughout the PSTA 3 program.

53.     Environmental considerations in rural roads. The rural roads to be improved in PSTA 3 follow the
existing alignment and remain within the existing right-of-way, hence limiting adverse environmental and social
impacts. The existing feeder roads are often about four meters wide. However, the new road act, which requires
upgrading some feeder roads to six meter width, may involve widening the road formation by two to three meters.

                                                         96
This may necessitate expropriating some farm lands and relocating households, which will be carried out
according to national environmental and social policies. The policies state that to avoid adverse negative
environmental and social impact, when a road proposed for improvement has to be widened, no road contract
tender should be launched before a road-specific Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) are prepared and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) with
mitigation measures is incorporated in the bidding documents.

54.      The roads to be improved traverse hilly terrain and marshlands, which could be environmentally and
socially sensitive. Roads in the hilly terrain require construction of culverts, often small in size, following the
existing natural water course. Side drains may require stone pitching and check dams to control erosion. The soil
along the roads is mostly soft, and could be excavated by labor, which helps in limiting damage to the
environment, as labor construction involves gentle cutting and minimal spillovers. The marshlands are often in-
between hills and are increasingly used for small-scale, community-owned, irrigation-based farming. The farms
are usually at the foot of the hills adjacent to the marshland. The roads crossing marshlands may have to be raised
and the side slopes may have to be flatter, involving widening; this will not require relocating people, but does
require degrading more marshland area. The existing roads often cross on the shorter side of the marshland, which
will limit the negative impact. The impact on fauna and flora is expected to be limited as the roads follow existing
routes, and road sides are cultivated or already cleared.

55.      Adverse impacts on natural vegetation which normally are associated with the operation of quarries,
borrow areas, and the construction of detours and access roads will be limited as the quarry and borrow material
requirement for feeder roads is minimal and as much as possible existing borrow/quarry sites will be used. The
maintenance works are expected to use existing borrow sites for sourcing materials and will not require opening
up new borrow pits. The impact on soil erosion will be negligible, as will the impact on the stability of slopes or
the sedimentation/siltation of rivers. Instead, the rehabilitation of the road will decrease erosion along the road
alignment by stabilizing slopes and providing proper drainage. The maintenance works to be carried out in the
future, after completion of the rehabilitation, are not expected to induce negative impacts, but will instead help to
control slope stability and soil erosion. Maintenance works will help control roadside siltation caused by the
anticipated continued agricultural activities in the project area. As observed in many roads constructed in the hilly
terrain, landslides/rockslides from the hilltops will remain a potential problem, given the geo-technical nature of
these areas. Emphasis should be on timely post-works maintenance activities. The implementation of the ESMPs
prepared for the rehabilitation shall continue.

56.      It is expected that the rehabilitation of the roads will result in net positive environmental and social
impacts through enhanced access for rural populations, as well as increased agricultural productivity and
increased access to economic opportunities. On the environmental side, improved road asset management will
reduce the need for frequent road reconstruction. In hilly areas where soil erosion is a problem, improved feeder
rural roads will also enhance the sustainability of critical transport infrastructure.

57.      The Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) provides guidelines and monitoring
implementation of national environmental safeguard measures. Rwanda Transport Development Authority
(RTDA) has environmental and social specialists that look after safeguard issues for the main road contracts, but
it has not yet established an Environmental and Social Management Unit. The Environmental Officers of the
Districts under the Environment and Water Resource Management Units are responsible for environmental and
social safeguard aspects of development projects, but due to capacity limitations, their engagement is restricted to
minor community-level development actions.

58.     REMA provides overall guidance on the preparation of Environmental and Social Impact Assessments
(ESIAs) and approves ESIAs and follow-up implementation of safeguard measures for development projects,
including roads. REMA has issued guidelines for the preparation of ESIAs for road projects. The guidelines have


                                                         97
been reviewed and found to be technically sound. Based on REMA’s guidelines, MINAGRI prepares the ESMF
and works with the Districts to prepare the RPFs.

59.     Planning for climate change. The 2011 National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon
Development is technically sound and will be used to guide overall planning for climate change. There is no
particular indictor in the RF to help monitor the mainstreaming of climate change issues. MINAGRI should
consider including one to track climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts within the sector.

60.      Nutrition and Household Vulnerability. MINAGRI recognizes its role in and accountability for
ensuring availability of and access to affordable, nutritious foods to ensure food and nutrition security for all
Rwandan citizens. One key target of PSTA 3 is to ensure that at least 90 percent of Rwandan households have
acceptable food consumption. MINAGRI recognizes two approaches to improving access to and availability of
nutritious foods. The first is increasing overall agricultural productivity, recognizing increasing income will result
in more money spent on higher-nutrient, quality foods including meat, dairy, fruit, and vegetables. The Crop
Intensification Program (CIP), started in September 2007, focuses on six core staple crops: maize, wheat, rice,
Irish potatoes, beans, and cassava. Under this program, farmers organized in SHGs synchronize the cultivation of
crops. Farm inputs such as improved seeds and fertilizers were imported and distributed to farmers through PPPs,
and extension services on the use of inputs and improved cultivation practices rendered to farmers. The second
approach is to increase the diversity of available foods and “upgrade” the nutrient quality of foods. The former
was done through the promotion of home gardens; the latter by using biofortified staple crops wherever possible.
Biofortified crops are bred with better nutrient profiles by exploiting the natural variation between varieties of the
same crop. The GoR has committed to disseminating and promoting all biofortified staples that are or could be
available in Rwanda. MINAGRI encouraged and disseminated the first available biofortified staple crop, high-
iron beans, within the CIP. It also promotes cultivation of biofortified vitamin A-rich sweet potato. MINAGRI has
requested the biofortified vitamin A cassava currently available in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is
completing trials of vitamin A maize for release in 2015.

61.     Recognizing the importance of animal source foods for nutrition, especially for the poorest, the
government introduced the One-Cow (Girinka) Program. The program was set up with the central aim of reducing
child malnutrition rates and increasing household incomes of poor farmers by giving households access to milk.
Started in 2006, the program gives a heifer to a poor household, with a goal of reaching 350,000 of the poorest
households in the most food-insecure Districts. Small livestock, such as goats, were also distributed. As a result,
47 percent of households now have a cow, and 57 percent have a goat, increasing the availability and
consumption of milk by small children. These beneficiaries, in turn, agree to pass on one of their offspring
livestock to another eligible family.

62.      While agriculture clearly has positive impacts on nutritional outcomes by increasing the availability and
affordability of a diversified diet, it can also have negative impacts on nutrition through the consequences of
increased agricultural productivity. MINAGRI recognizes and is addressing the potentially negative nutritional
impacts of the CIP, particularly for maize. Post-harvest handling and storage of maize is particularly important
given poor drying and storage, resulting in high levels of aflatoxins. These toxins are virtually indestructible,
consumption by humans is cumulative, and the toxins can seriously impair human health. Numerous studies have
shown children with high aflatoxin levels also have higher levels of stunting. Consumption of grain with high
levels of aflatoxins can result in aflatoxicosis, leading to death, as happens in Kenya every few years.

63.      The Post-Harvest Handling and Storage Taskforce has focused on training farmers’ cooperatives on post-
harvest storage and drying, and has distributed equipment, constructed drying grounds and warehouses, and
installed metal silos, as well as distributing hermetic bags. Post- harvest losses of maize and rice declined from 32
percent to 9 percent, and 25 percent to 15 percent, respectively, for season 2013 A. While this is not equivalent to



                                                         98
reducing aflatoxin, the attention paid to post-harvest drying and storage has undoubtedly significantly reduced the
incidence of aflatoxin in maize.

64.      EDPRS 2 and PSTA 3 have clearly articulated a vision and focus areas to address the food security and
nutrition challenges. The Action Plan is well prepared and costed for recommended action lines. Some
preliminary key observations are: i) given the high rates of stunting and malnutrition and the linkage to poverty,
increasing household income sources for poor and vulnerable households is one key factor; ii) increasing access
to nutrition education for poor households is important. The new centers operated by cooperatives are one
potential venue where this could take place, especially where closer and more accessible to poor farmers.
Consideration could be given to delivering basic antenatal and nutrition services to women at these centers; iii)
the school feeding program is highlighted but it is not clear whether it is only the “One Cup of Milk per Child”
program or other foods. MINAGRI should look into linking the school feeding programs to agriculture by linking
farmer production to schools (homegrown school feeding program). This could extend beyond the crops in the
CIP, especially those that are biofortified, to excess production from household gardens; iv) one area to be
strengthened is bringing nutrition into the upstream of agriculture research and plant breeding. The nutrient
content of crops varies across varieties, and ensuring that plant breeding and adoption focuses on the varieties
with better nutrition profiles is key. This is particularly important given climate change, where evidence suggests
that the production of crops grown in high CO2 concentrations have poorer nutrition profiles than the seeds
planted; v) MINAGRI could consider its guidelines for trials, certification, and release of new varieties to ensure
that varieties with poorer nutrient profiles than those that are currently grown are not released; and vi) another
area that could be further strengthened is bringing nutrition to the forefront of crop selection and value chains and
in the dialogue with the private sector. This includes identification of foods that can be industrially fortified in the
food chain.

                   Annex 5: Detailed Description of Program Institutional Arrangements

1.       The technical team reviewed the implementation arrangements for all 24 SPs of PSTA 3 and assessed the
adequacy of the systems, capacity, and commitment of implementing entities staff to implement the Program and
the proposed PAP, including the ability to manage fraud and corruption (F&C) risks. The team found that the
institutional arrangements are adequate and identified areas where strengthening could potentially help further
improve efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation of PSTA 3. Below is a detailed assessment of the
institutional arrangements for the implementation of each of the SPs.

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

2.       Soil Conservation and Land Husbandry activities are now being implemented by different agencies
(RAB, REMA), local administration (Districts) and SPIUs (LWH/RSSP, KWAMP). While there is an excellent
amount of good work being done, there is an apparent lack of coordination, harmonization, and standardization of
the different works and approaches for soil conservation and land husbandry. RAB has set an established
methodology for monitoring the coverage of soil erosion control infrastructure and will be reporting on the
situation every two years, but does not coordinate the implementation of different works being carried out in
different implementing agencies.

3.       Irrigation and Water Management are carried out by various agencies with different mandates such as
GoR-funded programs (GFI, QWM) implemented by the Irrigation and Mechanization Task Force (IMTF) and
donor-funded projects (RSSP3, LWH, PAIRB, KWAMP). When projects close, the infrastructure is handed over
to beneficiaries under the guidance of relevant Districts, but no single national authority oversees irrigation
schemes. The establishment of such a body is urgent, especially as the IMTF’s term ended on June 30, 2014. The
law establishing Water Users Associations (WUAs) was approved and gives beneficiaries of irrigation
infrastructure an obligation to maintain them.

4.       Agricultural Mechanization. To popularize mechanization and achieve a target of 25 percent
mechanized farm operations by 2017, the GoR, through the IMTF, has driven the mechanization program since
2008. An internally financed project, the IMTF was mandated to: i) promote mechanization options for rural
farmers; ii) develop local skills and strengthen capacity in agricultural mechanization; and iii) promote
mechanization in post-harvest activities. On June 30, 2014 the Task Force was phased out, and its activities
absorbed within RAB. According to data from Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) an MINIFRA, the current fleet
of agricultural machinery in Rwanda is estimated at 240 tractors, 270 power tillers, 35 rice planters, 7 combine
harvesters mainly for rice and maize, and around 2,000 attachment tools for tractors and power tillers. Related
activities implemented include: the creation of 17 Village Mechanization Services Centers (VMSCs) for hiring
and selling services; feasibility studies for an assembly plant for tractors and power tillers; mounting of several
demonstrations in collaboration with the private sector/market preparation; and various training activities,
including training 300 farmers and 50 tractor operators and technicians on operation and maintenance of
machinery. After the initial wave of investments, the government plans to gradually withdraw and hand over the
procurement and distribution of mechanization equipment to the private sector. The government would scale
down to 60 percent within the next three years and then be phased out completely thereafter, but would continue
to ensure a conducive environment for private sector investment through enabling policies and to provide soft
services such as extension, thematic studies, and capacity building of relevant stakeholders. In a drive to attract
private investors into the mechanization sector, MINAGRI secured the services of three private investors: Way-
Invest Ltd; Yanmar-Japan (through Akagera Motors); and Mahindra-Indian (through ETC Agro). In addition,
around eight manufacturing companies, mainly of post-harvesting equipment, have been established.

5.      Agrochemical Use and Markets. Rwanda depends on imports for all its agrochemical fertilizer
requirements because the country has no local production. Fertilizer is generally procured in small consignments
of 2,000-2,500 tons from fertilizer traders in Uganda, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, Dubai, Jordan, and China.

                                                       100
Between 1998 and 2005, fertilizer was imported entirely by the private sector. As of December 2006, three types
of fertilizer importers were operating in Rwanda: i) importers supplying primarily to tea and coffee parastatals
against confirmed orders; ii) importers buying in small lots from neighboring countries to satisfy local demand;
and iii) the GoR importing large quantities for distribution to all categories of customers. Fertilizer imports
evolved from 1,344 tons in 1995 to 9,039 tons in 2006, and were inadequate to meet the government’s targets for
the country. In 2009, MINAGRI started importing and distributing fertilizer in bulk (in 100, 50, and 25 kg bags)
to food crop farmers through 20 distributors and 1,062 agro-dealers under a fertilizer subsidy program, while
NAEB imports fertilizer for coffee farmers. Distributors are provided with supply credit to procure the fertilizers
for the government subsidy program. By 2013, import levels reached 35,000 tons, about 95 percent of which is by
the government through private importers under an input subsidy program. As part of the plan to pull out of the
subsidy program, MINAGRI withdrew the supply credit in 2013 to allow for private sector participation in
fertilizer import and distribution. To fill the gap, three private companies have registered with the government to
import fertilizers. MINAGRI is gradually reducing its fertilizer subsidy with the target of being completely out of
it by 2018. It is also exploring ways to make the subsidy more efficient and opening it up to all crops. The
government is committed to liberalizing the fertilizer subsector and having the entire fertilizer value chain (from
importing to supplying to farmers) operated by the private sector, based on farmers’ demand.

6.       Seed Development. Seed production in Rwanda has been dominated by producer cooperatives (60
percent) and individual farmers (40 percent). Under an input subsidy scheme, the GoR, through RAB, purchases
the seeds of maize, wheat, rice, and Irish potato and through private agro-dealers delivers them to farmers free of
charge to plant 0.5 ha. RAB floats tenders for the distribution of seed to beneficiaries after procurement. Only
farmers benefiting from the fertilizer subsidy scheme benefit from the subsidized seed program. Rwanda has
created a seed sector coordination unit (seed special program) in RAB. RAB’s seed special program focuses on: i)
pre-basic and basic seed production; ii) seed quality control and certification; iii) private seed management; and
iv) seed processing, marketing, and sales, although much emphasis is placed on i) and ii). Currently, pre-basic and
basic seed multiplication is carried out in RAB’s stations located in variou s Districts under the Agriculture Zone
Division responsibility. Each station is managed by a head of station under the Director of Agriculture Extension
and Research at the zone level. Certified seed production is presently carried out by 478 registered seed growers
and six farmers’ cooperatives located in RAB Stations of Sigira, Masogwe, Ruhunde, Mulindi, and Rugende.
RAB’s seed program also provides seed quality control and certification. Seed inspectors carry out seed
inspection on all seed fields registered after planting through the crop declaration. Each Province has a technical
assistant in seed production and quality officer reporting to the National Seed Coordinator. Although RAB’s seed
program has a mandate to produce and market seed, in the spirit of private sector development, the government
has decided to lessen its control of the seed sector, promote private investment, and phase out the seed subsidy,
welcome news to the private sector. All of these reforms are reflected in a fertilizer policy paper expected to be
approved in 2014.

7.      Livestock Development. The human resources are inadequate in number (for instance, there is one public
veterinarian for all 416 sectors and one per District) and skills required. The World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) Performance of Veterinary Service (PVS) evaluation report seems to confirm the same for the
animal health sector. Past experiences and implementation of livestock-related projects (e.g., the AfDB-funded
Livestock Infrastructure Support Project/ LISP) have shown that the GoR, through MINAGRI and RAB, knows
how to implement and monitor results-oriented investments in the livestock subsector. However, adopting a
programmatic, outcomes-oriented approach remains more challenging.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

8.      Research, technology transfer and extension for producers. RAB has the mandate to undertake
research on all crops and livestock. To execute this mandate, RAB has a Directorate of Research, headed by a
deputy director general (DDG). The DDG is supported by senior scientists at the national level and four zonal
directors who lead the research and extension programs on crops, livestock, and natural resources. The extension

                                                       101
function is implemented by the directorate of extension, and also headed by a DDG. The DDG extension is
supported by a number of coordinators and specialists at the national level. At the local level, extension services
are implemented as part of the CIP with implementation facilitated through local government (LG) structures
working together with RAB. The implementers include a district agronomist and contracted service providers to
support cooperatives/producers engaged in CIP activities. RAB provides national support and oversight, while the
LG is charged with implementation at the District and lower levels. In 2014, RAB has undertaken an institutional
review, and changes have been proposed based on the need to improve efficiency, accountability, and
sustainability of the delivery system and to devote more earmarked funds to the local level. Through the
institutional changes, more RAB staff will be deployed to the zones and Districts to support implementation and
decentralization policies and directives. The research programs are also to be consolidated to 16 at the zonal level.
These changes are expected to be implemented from July 2014.

9.       To reach more farmers, RAB together with LGs is planning to train and expand the number of farmer
promoters to 15,000 across the country. Already the LG has started the training of the promoters and RAB is
expected to earmark funds for the operations. When this capacity of farmer promoters is fully operational,
MINAGRI will have sufficient capacity to reach out to the estimated 2 million farm households in the country and
achieve the set results for the subprogram. The ownership of FFS by both RAB and LGs is a clear indication of
system sustainability. However, it is not clear whether the farmer promoters will also be used to cover livestock
activities. The Bank is of the view that for cost-efficiency reasons, the crop and livestock extension services
should be delivered using the same system, as most farmers have mixed farms.

10.     Farmers’ Cooperatives and Organizations. At the village level, lead farmers and farmer promoters will
be responsible for farmer mobilization and capacity building. MINAGRI has defined criteria for selection of
farmer promoters, and has provided a platform for exchange and sharing of knowledge (which is based on the
health worker model). It has also been connected recently to the cooperatives in the sector. The FFS facilitators
trained through the FFS approach are mapped at the Cell level (one per Cell) to train the farmer promoters.
Agriculture committees are established at all levels to act as command post and the roles and responsibilities
include coordination, monitoring, reporting, mobilization and advisory. Permanent operation centers/secretariats,
composed of two to three members drawn from MINAGRI and MINALOC, are established at the District and
national levels for day-to-day monitoring of activities. A national Agriculture Steering Committee oversees
implementation of activities and provides policy guidelines. A well-thought-through package of technical
assistance is required to ensure that the lead farmers/farmer promoters and Cell- and District-level staff receive a
full package of training and backstopping to ensure their effective performance in the different roles of farmer
mobilization, SHG formation, skill enhancement, monitoring, and tracking. MINAGRI already has experience
(SPIU LWH/RSSP) and results on this field-level training and technical assistance. This existing capacity needs
to be mainstreamed and included in MINAGRI’s capacity-building strategy.

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

11.     Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate
market access. NAEB is the key institution mandated for delivering the strategic objectives of program 3 of
PSTA 3. NAEB was set up in 2011 by consolidating three government agencies responsible for cash crops and
agriculture exports. In particular, all services from the Rwanda Coffee Development Authority (OCIR CAFE), the
Rwanda Tea Development Authority (OCIR THE), and the Rwanda Horticulture Development Authority
(RHODA) were merged into this new agency. The institution’s two main departments “Production Support &
Value Chain Development” and “Export Operation & Market Development” deal with the production and
marketing sides, respectively, of priority export crops. NAEB has wide-ranging responsibilities including a
regulatory function, research and agricultural extension, licensing of operators, setting of quality standards,
issuing certificates of origin, training of farmers and cooperatives, international marketing, and the provision of
market intelligence. The new strategy envisions NAEB increasingly focusing on its core function as regulator and
creating a conducive environment for encouraging the private sector to take on a bigger role in research, extension

                                                        102
and marketing of export crops. NAEB is in the process of finalizing a medium-term export strategy firmly aligned
with the five-year EDPRS 2, PSTA 3, and the National Export Strategy. It has a particular focus on cross-cutting
sectoral issues and prioritized strategic interventions by key multistakeholder actors. The RF for this program
component should be updated to fully reflect NAEB’s final strategic plan 2013-2018 action matrix (expected to
be finalized by August 2014).

12.      Development of priority food crop value chains. RAB has the institutional mandate to promote food
crop productivity interventions. To do this, RAB has identified several drivers of productivity which include:
promoting use of improved seeds, agrochemical fertilizers, and compost/manure; controlling pests and diseases;
timely planting; maximizing the use of consolidated land; and promoting banana production. The GoR, through
MINAGRI, RAB, and other agencies, has a subsidy program that targets maize, wheat, beans, rice, Irish potatoes,
and soya. Smallholder farmers growing these crops received subsidized fertilizers, seeds, and other planting
materials. The level of subsidy varies with type of crop and input. For instance, maize and wheat farmers get 100
percent subsidized seeds, while farmers in land use consolidation (LUC) sites receive fertilizer subsidies of 50
percent. There are well-established procedures for identification and distribution of the subsidies, which are
mainly based on LG’s institutional set-up. While in the past the government agencies were responsible for
procurement and distribution of fertilizer and other subsidies, there is a gradual move to directly bring on board
private sector players. In March 2014, MINAGRI signed a Memorandum of Understanding with three companies
(Top Services Enterprises Ltd, Alfred Nkubili and Sons (ENAS), and One Acre Fund-TUBURA) for the import
and distribution of mineral fertilizers. The three companies have been allocated Districts in which they will
concentrate their operations.89 MINAGRI has also intensified training of agro-dealers throughout the country to
ensure farmers have access to their services. Plans are underway to reduce the subsidy level for most inputs, with
an objective of phasing out direct subsidies by 2017/18. These government strategies for promotion of food crops
and the measures being taken to bring on board private sector players are considered adequate and robust to
ensure the results set under PSTA 3 are met. However, the risk of the subsidy program being captured or misused,
although minimal at the moment, needs to be evaluated further, and the necessary institutional strengthening
measures implemented.

13.      MINAGRI is responsible for sector capacity-building activities, and a strategy has been developed to
address the capacity gaps. For its part, RAB completed a capacity-building assessment of its functions and
mandates in 2013 and developed a strategic plan. Through this assessment every program area has identified the
human resource capacity gaps at all levels (support, technical, and professional). Infrastructure gaps have also
been identified. However, given the proposed decentralization changes, there is need to revise the strategic plan to
incorporate these changes. The overall capacity of RAB is assessed to be adequate to deliver the results areas
under RAB’s strategic plan. However, there is need to finalize the review of the strategic plan and incorporate any
identified capacity gaps as part of the PAP of the Ag. PforR.

14.      Development of priority export crop value chains. The capacity of NAEB could be described as
generally sufficient, adding the complementarities with LG structures to follow up and support delivery of all
planned interventions. Coordination issues might arise where MINICOM and MINAGRI intersect in processing
activities and trade facilitation, but a coordination mechanism (Industrial Development and Export Council/IDEC)
was put in place to tackle the issue. There is strong commitment at all relevant agencies to implement the
program, including export targets as a key part of the results performance agreements of the agencies involved.
Considerable experience and sector expertise exists within the key counterparts (MINAGRI and NAEB) around

89
 Top Services Ltd. will be distributing fertilizers to the Districts of Musanze, Burera, Nyabihu, Ngororero, Rubavu, Gakenke, Gicumbi,
Muhanga, Kamonyi, and Rulindo. ENAS will be distributing fertilizers for the Eastern Province of Rwanda and Kigali, namely the
Nyagatare, Gatsibo, Kayonza, Kirehe, Ngoma, Rwamagana, Bugesera, Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge Districts. One Acre Fund-
TUBURA has been given the responsibility of providing fertilizers for the Districts of Karongi, Rutsiro, Nyamasheke, Rusizi, Nyamagabe,
Nyaruguru, Huye, Nyanza, Ruhango, and Gisagara.



                                                                 103
planning for and supporting expansion of the coffee and tea subsectors. Less experience seems available in the
horticulture and pyrethrum subsectors. Planning for the tea expansion program is well underway, including
establishment of multiple nurseries to support the 18,000 ha expansion. However, to achieve the ambitious targets
and ensure the development of market-driven value chains, a “new deal” is needed in terms of extension of
partnership with the relevant private sector and other key stakeholders, right from the beginning.

15.      For investment promotion-related activities, NAEB will have to work closely with RDB, the focal
institution for investment promotion and facilitation in Rwanda. For reviewing and updating the regulatory
framework for export value chains, it will have to work closely with MINAGRI as the main policy-setting
institution. Given NAEB’s ambitious implementation plans for each subsector and its relatively limited capacity
to execute, it is advisable to strengthen NAEB’s core team with some experts to assist with planning and
execution of implementation in each value chain.

16.      Development of priority dairy, meat, fisheries, and apiculture value chains. In “small” subsectors and
value chains (but with high potential), such as fisheries and beekeeping, the capacity to implement such a program
is questionable, due to the lack of human resources (for instance, for beekeeping, there are only two specialists in
MINAGRI and four in RAB at the central level, and the sector relies on generalist veterinarians at the local level).
Similar assessments are made in very specific areas that would contribute to the overall objectives, such as milk
quality and food safety. Therefore, it is recommended that as part of SPs 1.6, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, a specific needs
assessment and capacity-building and training plan be developed and implemented. In addition SP 2.3 (Farmers’
cooperatives and organizations) and the entire program 4 will be key to achieving the overall objectives of the
livestock intensification and productivity increase. Subsequent institutional arrangements must ensure that animal
production and health staff from MINAGRI and RAB fully participate in the respective subworking groups for
program design, preparation, and implementation.

17.      Agricultural finance. Currently, only one staff member in MINAGRI is in charge of the agricultural
finance agenda. While the individual is extremely competent and proactive, given the requirements of the next
steps to achieve the Program targets, this capacity is inadequate. Moreover, while the Access to Finance Rwanda
(AFR) is a unique platform through which pilots and assessments to enhance agricultural finance can be
implemented, it is not yet well-positioned to support MINAGRI to achieve its strategic objectives in this area. For
agricultural insurance, a PPP model backed by law and regulated at the national level is one of the most proven
arrangements. Under this scheme, a public agriculture insurance entity provides premium support to private
insurance companies that underwrite agriculture risk, set premium rates, and do their own actuarial analysis. The
objective of this scheme is to share the premium burden with the farmer, but also to spur underwriting discipline
and competition from agriculture insurers.

18.     Market-oriented Infrastructure for Post-Harvest. Promote efficient and equitable transport systems.
The engagement of multiple institutions (i.e., a decentralized road administration at the District level with limited
experience in managing development feeder roads investments) and not being able to rely on good support from
national-level institutions leads to an implementation challenge, requiring significant resource allocation to build
capacity. MINAGRI, MINIFRA, and MINALOC have capacity-building activities90 within each sector program,
which should be sufficient to strengthen the Districts and national entities responsible for feeder roads oversight.
There is a need to strengthen the planning, collaboration, and prioritization of road investments among the various
stakeholder government ministries such as MINAGRI, MINIFRA, and MINALOC.


90
   Support to the Districts and national coordination entities capacity building, includes: i) technical assistance to the Districts
infrastructure, finance, procurement, environmental management, and planning units through adoption of systems and manuals and
provision of training to District staff; and ii) strengthening the capacity of national coordination entities, through provision of training on
feeder roads development planning, monitoring and maintenance for MINAGRI and RTDA staff.



                                                                     104
19.      Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level. To reduce post-
harvest losses, MINAGRI’s Post-harvest Taskforce is implementing the Post-harvest Strategy, which involves a
number of measures to address losses, such as: developing training materials; delivering training; and providing
drying and shelling facilities and equipment to cooperatives and individual farmers, as well as adopting quality
standards. The Taskforce has a Post-harvest Extension Department whose role is to undertake post-harvest
extension work. The strategy is implemented through Provincial Coordinators, who supervise District post-
harvest extension officers. NGOs liaise with MINAGRI to implement post-harvest handling and storage activities
(developing training materials, training, and installing storage and drying facilities). Other initiatives to reduce
post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregation level include: distribution of hermetically sealed grain
storage cocoons; construction of storage silos with donor assistance (ACDI/VOCA, UNDP, WFP, IFAD, etc.);
and rehabilitation of pre-1994 strategic storage facilities, previously under the ownership and management of
OPROVIA-GRENARWA. The strategic grain reserves (SGR) managed by the Post-Harvest Taskforce also helps
to reduce post-harvest losses. Opportunity exists to tender the leasing of these stores and the management of SGR
within the stores to the private sector. As additional storage is made available in more rural areas, the amount of
SGR held in these silos could be reduced; the leaseholder could then use the additional storage for other economic
activities. It is, however, critical that MINAGRI with support from MINICOM builds ISAR’s Post -Harvest
Team’s capacity to identify and prioritize economically relevant post-harvest technologies and to disseminate and
promote their uptake. The current staffing of ISAR with food scientists should be reconstituted to include
agricultural engineers and economists to evaluate potential technologies and build commercialization strategies
for post-harvest activities.

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

20.      Institutional Capacity Building. MINAGRI and its two agencies (RAB and NAEB), its three SPIUs,
and the Districts have a designated focal person to coordinate CD needs and initiatives, especially since
various DPs provide several types of CD assistance. For example, MINAGRI has a designated coordinator for
the Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI). Given the large number of Districts (30), the institutional
arrangements for coordinating these CD initiatives vary. It is envisioned that one of the outputs of the above CD
assessment exercise is to recommend enhanced institutional arrangements for coordinating and enhancing the
M&E of CD initiatives, with a stronger results focus. Updating ASIP’s M&E framework is intended to provide
MINAGRI with a more functional tool for evidenced-based decision making. These initiatives would help
strengthen the institutionalization of CD as a key instrument for strengthening the planning, budgeting,
implementation, and governance structure and program management cycle, and therefore, a stronger tool for
managing risks. A recent CD assessment (supported by USAID, 2014, reference cited above) concluded that with
respect to the food security system, MINAGRI needs to improve the alignment, consistency, and inclusive
institutional arrangements and mechanisms for promoting effective dialogue, evaluation platforms, and
mechanisms for the public sector, private sector, civil society, and research institutions. This type of strengthening
would help sustain evidenced-based policy design and implementation processes, which would enhance the
implementation of PSTA 3 and achievements of its targets.

21.      Decentralization in Agriculture. The GoR has a clear decentralization strategy and supporting
institutional arrangements and roles at the subnational level. However, there is less clarity at the level of
MINAGRI, its entities (RAB and NAEB), and SPIUs in terms of ensuring that their organizational and functional
structure and systems are well integrated and supportive of the envisioned expanded decentralization of
agricultural services. Currently, RAB and NAEB are finalizing their strategic plans to be strongly aligned with
PSTA 3’s RF, and the recently prepared ASIP. This includes working out appropriate organizational, functional,
and staffing structure reforms to enhance decentralized agricultural services. During the Ag. PforR assessment
mission, three key elements that will need continued strengthening at the District level were identified, consistent
with recent progress reports: the planning, budgetary, and M&E aspects of decentralization, which involve all
sectors including agriculture. It will be important for MINAGRI to coordinate closely with MINALOC and its CD
initiatives at the District level, whose activities address these three key elements.

                                                         105
22.      MIS: Agricultural M&E, Statistics and Communication. Currently, the agriculture sector MIS
operates at the national and subnational levels, involving a relatively large number of diverse actors with
specified and complementary roles in data collection and reporting, utilizing various reporting processes
and mechanisms and exhibiting varying levels of capacity to deliver on their expected roles and outputs. In
general, there is an attempt to utilize the M&E framework developed in 2011, although various constraints
impede its full and effective application. At the national level, the MIS system, especially the M&E system, is
supported by four main vehicles for collection of impact, outcome, and output data: i) the periodic household
poverty survey (EICV, with the last household data collected in 2011), conducted by the National Information
Statistical Office/NISO; ii) annual crop assessment surveys, conducted by MINAGRI staff; iii) project and
program data, collected by MINAGRI’s project entities (via the SPIUs); and iv) routine data, collected primarily
by District- and sector-level agronomists and veterinarians.

23.     In addition, MINAGRI has a number of other data collection, reporting, and monitoring systems
and mechanisms that contribute to various reporting and communication requirements (especially to
monitor the annual performance contracts, with various entities). These include: i) periodic national
agricultural surveys; ii) the comprehensive food security and vulnerability analysis (CFSVA) and six-monthly
Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System; iii) Joint Sector Reviews, which occur twice a year to assess the
common performance accountability framework (CPAF), with respect to key indicators from the EDPRS Results
and Policy Matrix; these reviews involve participation by DPs; iv) National Leadership Retreat, which draws on
the Prime Ministerial Quarterly Report (ref. the “dashboard” of key indicators) and provides inputs for t he annual
national leadership retreat, assessing the performance of sector ministries (and their annual performance
contracts); v) the Agriculture Sector Working Group, which meets monthly and comprises key sector stakeholders
(the government, DPs, private sector, NGOs) as the main forum for regular sector coordination; vi) the
Agriculture Sector Budget Support Group (“SWAp subgroup”), comprising key DPs for aid coordination matters,
with a focus on budget support in the agriculture sector; vii) Budget Support Harmonization Group, which focuses
on discussing and coordinating budget support for Rwanda; and viii) MINAGRI M&E Working Group, which
was recently broadened to include overall sector planning and M&E activities, bringing together the planning and
M&E officers from the various agencies of MINAGRI; its aim is to enhance, align, and harmonize annual work
plan and budgetary activities and M&E activities for MINAGRI and its various entities.

24.      The key actors at the national level include MINAGRI (coordinated by the Planning Department),
and its main implementation agencies (RAB, NAEB, and three SPIUs). Each of these implementation
agencies have their own M&E system, which are in the early stages of being integrated into an overall sectoral
MIS. The recent M&E framework assessment exercise highlighted some of the challenges in the extent of
fragmentation of M&E activities carried out by the above actors, which tend to focus on monitoring the expected
outputs outlined in their performance contracts. Further operationalization of the sector-wide MIS needs to
intensify its efforts to achieve a more integrated M&E system that can meet the performance contract
requirements, as well as PSTA 3’s requirements in tracking the impact and outcome level targets.

25.      At the subnational level, there has been less attention to devising and managing coordinated
processes and mechanisms to ensure a well-integrated and coordinated sectoral MIS system. The focus at
the subnational level is for District- and sector-level officials (especially the agronomist, coordinated with the
District-level Planning Director) to carry out regular monitoring and reporting of primarily key outputs, especially
those included in the performance contracts of the Districts. The abovementioned assessment highlighted some of
the challenges of generating reliable production/productivity data of crops and some of the CD and reporting
requirements to ensure more reliable and effective M&E systems that can be better integrated with the national-
level agriculture sector MIS system outlined above.

26.    From the reviews and activities, and given the requirements of meeting the ambitious but
achievable PSTA 3 targets, MINAGRI (and its agencies) endeavors to further enhance and coordinate its

                                                        106
evolving agricultural MIS. PSTA 3’s M&E requirements pose additional challenges to strengthen the overall
MIS system and its components to ensure it becomes an effective management tool to track progress, support
better decision making, and enable the achievement of the PSTA targets at output, outcome, and impact levels.

27.     Gender and youth in agriculture. A number of agencies at the District level (e.g., Ministries of
Gender and Family Planning, National Council of Women and MINAGRI) are working together to address
gender and youth issues. The focus is on building the capacity of agricultural staff (such as agronomists,
livestock specialists, and LSPs) to deliver gender-responsive service. The Ministry of Gender and Family
Planning is the focal point and coordinates gender-related work with other ministries. MINAGRI has prepared
various training modules for extension service agents and LSPs in gender-responsive service delivery. It is
recommended to strengthen gender-sensitive aspects in other capacity-building activities as well as increase the
quality of training provided to extension agents and LSPs.

28.     Environmental Mainstreaming in Agriculture. Environmental considerations in rural roads.
REMA provides both guidelines and monitoring implementation of national environmental safeguard
measures, including rural feeder roads oversight. RTDA’s environmental and social specialists monitor
safeguard issues related to rural feeder roads works. Districts also have Environmental Officers within their
Environment and Water Resource Management Units responsible for the environmental and social safeguard
aspects of rural feeder roads.

29.     Planning for climate change. Planning for climate change adaptation is done in accordance with the
2011 National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon Development, with MINAGRI taking the
sector responsibility. Currently the focus is on risk assessment and vulnerability mapping through modeling and
creating a database. Several research programs for enhancing climate change adaptation and mitigation are
ongoing. Apart from these activities, limited institutional capacity exists in the sector to promote and coordinate
climate change issues. The greatest challenge is raising various stakeholders’ awareness on climate change issues,
particularly the farming community. MINAGRI needs to enhance its capacity to promote and coordinate climate
change issues with other GoR ministries (e.g., Environment, MINALOC) and agencies such as RAB and NAEB.

30.      Nutrition and household vulnerability. While the GoR policy can be seen as top-down,
implementation is at the District and local levels – MINALOC is one of the core owners of the National
Nutrition Policy. This is also reflected in the building of strategies based on District and sector strategies, such as
in the development of EDPRS 2. Coordination is done by seven ministries at the District level – there is a
nutrition sector working group with representation from MoH, Education, MINALOC, Gender, Disaster, and
MINAGRI, with overall coordination under MoH. Both MoH and MINAGRI rely on community-level
implementation mechanisms. Health workers are the main agents of change at the village level – there are two or
three health workers per village. These workers are not only responsible for basic health provision in the village
(including training in preparation of oral rehydration salts complemented by distribution of zinc tablets to treat
diarrhea and distribution of contraceptives), they also carry out growth monitoring. Each month every household
with a child under five years is visited, the child is weighed and measured, and parents are counselled on healthy
eating practices.

31.     In MINAGRI, implementation is done through the formation of SHGs consisting of 12-20 farmers
each. MINAGRI staff are trained and sensitized on gender. SHGs’ membership must include at least 30
percent women, including members and officeholders, with many exceeding this requirement. SHGs form
the crux of MINAGRI’s implementation strategy. Each SHG has five lead farmers trained in various aspects to
help the group. One farmer is trained in conflict management and social welfare whom MINAGRI links to the
community health workers. In some cases, community health workers are also part of SHG, and are the lead
farmer. Through this system, all members of the farmer group are trained on healthy eating and food preparation,
especially for young children, using the production from their farms and home gardens. This is consistent with


                                                         107
community health workers goals to reduce malnutrition in their communities. This could be extended to more
formal delivery of services by community health workers in cooperative centers.

32.       These SHGs decide together on which crops will be grown on their consolidated land. As the groups
build their social capital, a number of SHGs are amalgamated at the zone level. This builds another level,
with an elected management body at the zone level, mirroring that at the SHG level, with an equal focus on
incorporation of women. As the zones develop their social capital, they are federated into farmers’ cooperatives.
At this point, the GoR investment in drying and storage, warehousing, and equipment is catalyzed. The
cooperative receives the services of a manger for 12 months to help the cooperative build capacity to manage
itself, to improve the quality of its production, and to begin to sell to the private sector and develop negotiation
and contracting skills. Cooperatives also start to include other services at their facilities, inviting more
engagement on nutrition through the community health workers, as well as access to financial services. This
structure has been successful. The increased yields have substantially increased farmer incomes. It is notable that
one of the first things that many farmers acknowledge buying is health insurance, which is available in Rwanda,
with fees based on the level of income. Health insurance ratchets up the impact of the nutrition education and
improved diets by increasing the likelihood that sick children will be taken for health care.

                             Annex 6: Detailed Program Expenditure Framework


Total Public Expenditure on Agriculture

1.       Public expenditure on agriculture through MINAGRI has shown a rapidly increasing trend in
recent years. Table A6.1 gives recent expenditure and the current MTEF budget for MINAGRI, separated
into its recurrent and development components. MINAGRI’s expenditure and budget has increased
significantly in recent years, with substantial increases in 2010/11 and in the current MTEF period starting in
2013/14. It is welcome that the government has started to devote a greater share of its resources to agriculture. It
should be noted that the figures shown below do not reflect the total amount of public funds to the agriculture
sector, given the expenditures by other central ministries and by the 30 Districts. Around three-quarters of
expenditure is development expenditure due to the large internal and donor-financed projects funded from the
development budget. The recurrent budget largely covers operational costs, including salaries and wages.

2.       The proportion of government expenditure allocated to agriculture through MINAGRI is rising
and estimated to be about 6.0 percent in 2014/15. As stated above, MINAGRI does not provide all public
funding in the agriculture sector. MINIRENA has significant soil conservation programs under its mandate to
protect the environment and is also responsible for the forestry subsector, with MINAGRI only responsible for
agro-forestry. MINALOC is responsible for Districts, the main vehicle for local service delivery, including
agricultural support services. When this funding for agriculture through other ministries is included, Rwanda
passes the CAADP target of 10 percent government spending on agriculture (currently estimated to be about 13
percent, although this figure needs to be reconfirmed with disaggregated data).

Expenditure by Agency

3.      MINAGRI’s two implementing agencies, RAB and NAEB, are funded from MINAGRI’s budget
and in addition it implements projects though its three SPIUs. Most MINAGRI funds are retained
centrally, reflecting the large internal and donor-funded SPIUs managed by MINAGRI. All agencies have
seen a trend of increasing expenditure and budgets as the government has devoted increasing resources to
agriculture (Table A6.3).

5.       Slightly under three-quarters of program expenditure and budgets are through the agriculture and
animal resource intensification program. This program covers large internal and donor-funded projects in land
conservation, irrigation, provision of farm inputs, and agricultural mechanization. The second largest program
addresses value chain development and private sector investment. With the increasing focus of the government on
the private sector, this program has received significant additional funding in recent years. The research and
institutional development programs are funded at far lower levels.



Budget Execution

6.      It is important to consider budget execution rates, especially in the current context of rapidly
increasing budgets in agriculture. MINAGRI budget execution rates are consistently high, with rates close
to 100 percent for RAB and NAEB (Table A6.5). Execution rates are significantly higher for MINAGRI’s
central budget, reflecting high expenditure by the large internal and donor-funded projects managed from the

                                                             110
center. Good performance on these projects means that they consistently spend more than their initial budgets for
the year, resulting in MINECOFIN providing additional funds during the budget revision in the later part of the
fiscal year.

7.       Decentralization Implications for Public Expenditures. The Decentralization Implementation
Strategy envisions an expanded proportion of funds from MINAGRI (and its two boards and three SPIUs)
to be channeled through subnational entities (especially at the District level). In recent years, this proportion
has increased rapidly, reaching about 60 percent in 2013/2014. Most of these funds have been in the form of
earmarked allocations for specific agricultural activities to be implemented at the subnational level. These
activities include funding a relatively large number of the 24 SPs, including the production-oriented expenditures
(e.g., soils, irrigation, mechanization, inputs, technology generation and transfer, capacity development). In line
with the spirit of decentralization, there is a significant policy push to increase the proportion of earmarked funds
into “open funds,” whereby Districts have the flexibility to set specific priorities and allocate these sector funds to
address relevant sector issues. Currently, the “open funds” constitute a small percent of total allocated funds from
MINAGRI to the Districts. In the short term, there will be continued emphasis on using and expanding earmarked
funds for specific programs through District implementation.

ASIP Program Structure and Cost Estimates

8.       The recently prepared ASIP had two scenarios for the five-year public investment program to
support the implementation of PSTA 3 and its four programs: Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource
intensification; Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; Program 3: Value
chain development and private sector investment; Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-
cutting issues. The ASIP costing exercise adopted the prioritization criteria developed as part of the RF for PSTA
3, namely: the degree to which SPs/activities contribute to: i) Vision 2020 and EDPRS 2 strategic objectives and
targets (including agriculture sector growth of 8.5 percent p.a. and reduced poverty levels; ii) increased crop,
livestock productivity, and food security; iii) inclusive agricultural private sector investment; iv) enhanced
market-oriented commercialization and value addition; and v) agriculture export growth.

9.      The initial cost estimate had a large and noncredible financing gap (about US$1 billion), referred to
as the “high-cost scenario.” A “medium-cost scenario” was thus constructed with the purpose of bringing ASIP
implementation costs within an affordable range, based on likely financing sources and amounts. The main
differences in the assumptions between the two scenarios are as follows:
     PSTA 3 targets were revised significantly downwards to reach more financially achievable levels,
        especially for the five highest-cost SPs;
     PSTA 3’s prioritization criteria were more rigorously applied to a prioritized RF;
     Some unit costs were revised downwards based on savings that could result from -+cost sharing of public
        projects with farmers. Land conservation terraces and irrigation schemes were identified as areas where
        greater cost sharing with farmers could be achieved;
     A strong enabling framework for private sector growth and development with a business-friendly
        regulatory environment and more aggressive investment promotion following the strategic theme set out

                                                         111
        above was expected to lead to greater private sector investment, especially in export crops and processed
        products;
       A review of the RF identified public sector projects that could be implemented by PPP arrangements.
        Further PPP opportunities were identified for coffee, tea, horticulture, irrigation, milk collection centers
        and dairy processing, meat processing, and hides and skins;
       Fertilizer, lime, and seed subsidies were fully phased out by 2017/18, with the private sector leading the
        farm inputs market;
       Agricultural research was scaled up to provide more innovative technologies for farmers, which is critical
        for achieving yield targets; and
       Extension was improved and expanded to provide support and training for farmers.

The medium-cost scenario is therefore one of lower costs, intended to bring costs within an affordable range.

11.      ASIP public sector implementation costs under the medium-cost scenario rise gradually from
US$229 million in 2013/14 to US$244 million in 2017/18, a total of US$1,213 million (rounded to US$1.2
billion) over the five-year ASIP period. Costs by program have a very different distribution under the medium-
cost scenario. Program 1 remains the largest program, accounting for just over half of all costs by 2017/18. The
revision of PSTA’s 3 targets in land conservation and irrigation down to more financially achievable levels as
well as the phasing out of subsidies on fertilizer, lime, and seeds bring Program 1 costs under the medium-cost
scenario to more affordable levels. Program 3 remains the next largest, with just under 30 percent of

implementation costs by 2017/18, but also with significantly reduced costs under the medium-cost scenario from
more financially achievable targets for the construction of rural roads. Reduction of Program 1 and 3
implementation costs under the medium-cost scenario creates the space to slightly increase the allocation to
Program 4 and to significantly increase the allocation to Program 2. Agricultural Research and Extension rises to
10.3 percent of ASIP implementation costs by its final year in 2017/18.

12.     The proportion of ASIP’s medium-cost scenario public sector costs taken by capital investment
rises gradually from 60 percent in 2013/14 to 68 percent in 2017/18. The proportion of costs taken by capital
is, however, significantly lower than under the high-cost scenario due to the reduction in PSTA 3 targets in land
conservation and irrigation as well as the reduction of the role of the state in agricultural mechanization.

13.     Table A6.8 provides the proposed financing plan, based on available information, DPs’ ongoing projects
and “firm” programming intentions for PSTA 3, and government contributions. Table A6.9 provides a summary
of the available funding vis-à-vis requirements, and shows a negligible deficit. However, it will be important for
the government and DPs to synchronize the timing of the funding to ensure it matches PSTA 3’s cash-flow
requirements.

14.     In summary, the ASIP program structure and expenditure levels build on the structure and
expenditure trends during the PSTA 2 period, while reflecting enhancements in the Program structure and
increased expenditures to reflect PSTA 3 costs and available funding. This pattern also reflects the recent
increases in budgetary allocations to MINAGRI, which are expected to be sustained in the medium term. It will
be important for the annual planning and budgetary cycle to ensure the required level and timing of allocations
from both the government and DPs match PSTA 3’s requirements. Accordingly, it is anticipated that there will be
a need to update the costs and financing plan in accordance with actual implementation.

                                    Annex 7: Detailed Program Economic Assessment

I.       Summary

1.      Annex 7 presents the economic assessment of the Agricultural Program for Results (PforR) support
operation for the Government of Rwanda's (GoR) Strategic Plan for the Third Phase of the Transformation of
Agriculture (PSTA 3). The rational for public sector financing as well as the World Bank value added are
presented followed by a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (ASIP).
Results are also presented to inform the relative prioritization of the different subprograms (SPs) in the ASIP
medium-cost scenario, which total US$1,195 million over five years in constant 2014 prices (equivalent to
US$1,214 million with inflation and projected changes in the RwF/USD exchange rate).

2.       Public sector rationale. The rationale for public sector investments includes that cash-poor farmers are
unable to internalize large unit development costs combined with long-term and downstream benefits. In the case
of irrigation and service delivery, plans include subsequent transfer of ownership and service provision to private
sector entities. Public sector intervention is also justified in key post-harvest investments that create spillover
effects but that have been delayed because of a lack of private sector financing.

3.      World Bank added value. World Bank financing in support of PSTA 3 would add comparative value
given the World Bank’s position to draw upon a wealth of global experience in areas directly related to Program
investments areas. Achievements from the successful implementation of ongoing World Bank-supported
operations in the sector also provide a strong background upon which to prepare this proposed operation.

4.      A 25-year cash flow model is used to assess the ex-ante productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of
public sector investments.91 While the costs of all SPs are included in the analysis, the model only quantifies
direct benefits for 9 of the 24 SPs – covering 77 percent of the public sector investment. It is assumed that the
private sector and public-private partnership (PPP) investments mapped out in the ASIP costs will occur and be
economically viable. The core of the analytical model estimates the impact of SP investments on revenues and
costs in seven different enterprise models: three cropping models, one livestock model, and three post-harvest
enterprises. In addition, the analysis quantifies increased benefits from greater employment opportunities in
agriculture and an estimate of the economic value of increased carbon sequestration.

5.       A selection of key drivers of agricultural growth are quantified in the model to analyze the impact
of changes in public sector investment costs by linking enterprise models and SP costs. Changes in public
sector investments lead to changes in: the number of developed hectares with terracing or irrigation; the number
of higher-yielding cows distributed; the number of infrastructures built for post-harvest drying and storage; and
the extent of new or improved feeder roads. Further to this, the model captures how SPs are designed to enhance
farm-level yields and affect fertilizer and seed use. The linkages between enterprise models and SP investments
also capture benefits from reduced soil erosion, labor savings from mechanization, cost savings from feeder roads,
avoided yield and price loss from post-harvest infrastructure, and adoption of new farming practices.

6.       The medium-cost scenario yields an economic net present value (NPV) of US$585 million and a
sound economic rate of return (ERR) of 21 percent. Undiscounted, this is equivalent to an average annual
economic net benefit of US$196 million. Using this estimate as a proxy for annual growth in the agriculture
sector, it constitutes 8.0 percent of the agricultural share of GDP only 0.5 percent short of, matching the 8.5
percent growth target in PSTA 3. Some benefits are not yet captured in this analysis, including incremental
benefits from value chain development.


91
   Financial prices are converted to economic prices using adjustment factors and amounts are noted in constant 2014 terms; the exchange
rate is RwF 650 to 1 USD.

                                                                  116
7.      Poverty reduction is achieved through increased employment generation and farm income, ranging
between US$320 and US$2,200 per year on a 0.6 ha farm. Assuming five people per farm household, this
constitutes about 0.3 to 2.3 times the national poverty line or US$0.20-1.20 per person per day. Poverty is also
reduced by generating agricultural employment in the order of 7.7 million work days per year or 29,400 fulltime
person-years.

8.      Elasticities indicate the relative impact of different SPs. An analysis of elasticities indicates that the
economic NPV is most sensitive to changes in investments in land conservation, research and technology transfer,
and soil fertility investments. Conversely, estimated elasticities indicate that the impact on employment
generation is driven particularly by investments in livestock development and irrigation, while employment
decreases with increased mechanization.

9.      Linkages between enterprise models and SPs highlight that there are positive synergies. In the case
of soil conservation and livestock production, increased income and availability of fodder and straw enable
livestock production while more available manure helps improve incomes and soil fertility. The net benefit from
investments in storage facilities is dependent on successful implementation of SPs that increase crop yields and
prices. Program delay and low farmer adoption rates are key risk factors that can threaten the achievement of
expected benefits. Risk management strategies should ensure minimum program delay while also increasing
farmer adoption rates through extension. Finally, it is important that yield increases are supported through SPs for
livestock and hillside developments because these enterprises constitute a large share of total program returns.

10.      Agriculture growth driven by the nine quantified SPs is enabled through linkages to the other SPs.
First, support for farmers' organizations helps improve access to inputs, markets, finance, insurance, and extension
services. Based on this, benefits can be captured in cropping and livestock production because these require
functioning markets for both farm inputs and outputs. Second, the enterprise models rely on access to markets via
value chains for crops, dairy, and meat including for increased production of cash crops and export. This requires
access to improved drying, storage, processing, and also transport, which are necessary to meet higher quality
standards and to sell perishable products to other than local markets.

11.      Effective institutions, adapted legal and regulatory frameworks, and targeting of disadvantaged
groups strengthen program impact. The impacts of investment in research, technology transfer, and extension
rely on effective institutions that can implement research programs and ensure farmer adoption of improved
technologies and farming practices. In addition, investments are planned to adapt the legal and regulatory system
to transform the agriculture sector toward higher value chains including exports. Finally, because investments that
increase productivity may be subject to elite capture, SP investments are planned to ensure that disadvantaged
groups benefit through greater food and nutrition security as well as through employment generation.

12.     Tracking impacts against a baseline with reliable M&E systems helps decision makers and
development partners (DPs) make evidence-based investment decisions. To ensure that the Program
investment is sound and stays on target, it becomes important to track impact against a baseline. SP 4.4
investments are needed both to establish the baseline against which impacts are measured, but also to assess if
investment priorities should change over time as new information comes to light. By establishing a statistical
system and a targeted M&E system, it becomes possible to implement sound investments in the future based on
timely and reliable information.

II.     Background

13.     The GoR requested the World Bank to provide an Agricultural Program for Results (PforR) support
operation for PSTA 3. The World Bank’s assessment methodology calls for an economic assessment of PSTA 3,
which is supported by the Bank. The focus in this annex is to analyze the medium-cost funding scenario for ASIP,
and comparisons are also made to the high-cost scenario. The economic assessment addresses four key aspects:

                                                        117
        a.   Rationale for Public Provision and Financing;
        b.   World Bank Added Value;
        c.   Program’s Economic Impact; and
        d.   Results of Economic Evaluation.

14.     This assessment aims to further enhance the design of the proposed PforR. The results of the economic
assessment can also be used as a tool to help determine the most suitable composition of public agricultural
investment costs. Where possible, the indicators and elasticities estimated in the model are used as proxies to
discuss the proposed prioritization criteria listed below for PSTA 3’s Results Framework (RF):
         Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to achieving Vision 2020 and EDPRS 2 strategic objectives
             and targets;
         Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to achieving increased crop, livestock productivity, and
             food security;
         Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to more inclusive agricultural private sector investment;
         Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to promoting enhanced market focus commercialization and
             value addition; and
         Degree to which SPs/activities contribute to accelerating agriculture export growth.

III.    Rationale for Public Provision and Financing

15.     In many cases, investments in productive activities are private goods for which there is no rationale for
public sector financing. Public sector investments are generally justified in the case of provision of public goods
and nonmonetary benefits, dealing with market failures, spillovers to non-Program areas, environmental
externalities, redistribution of wealth, and social and political concerns.

16.     Development of hillside terraces includes high unit costs combined with long-term and downstream
benefits. In the case of the ASIP medium-cost scenario, investments in radical and progressive terracing do
generate direct benefits to farmers. However, the investments also reduce long-term productivity losses from soil
erosion, which cash-poor farmers are not able to internalize in their farm management plans. Reduced soil erosion
also generates benefits for downstream irrigation systems that will experience reduced costs of clearing sediment
loads.

17.      Irrigation developments include high unit costs that are later transferred to private Water Users’
Associations (WUAs). In the case of irrigation development, the unit costs are so high that cash-poor farmers are
not able to cover the costs themselves nor to obtain financing without public sector support. Irrigation
development has spillover effects on the local population through employment generation and improved
availability of water for household use as well as livestock production. The investment includes the transfer of
self-reliant and self-financing irrigation schemes to WUAs and other nonpublic entities.

18.       Key post-harvest investments have been delayed because of a lack to access to adequate financing
but have the potential to generate key spillover effects. With a lack of access to financing for farmers, and
often also farmers' organizations, public sector funding can initialize investments in post-harvest infrastructure
projects. Again, some of these benefits are captured by farmers, but spillover effects include increased
employment opportunities and strengthening of high-value chains. In the case of building rural feeder roads, the
public sector justification is clearer, as roads are classical public goods with substantial spillover effects of
employment generation, greater productivity in all sectors, and easier access to health, education, and social
facilities and services.

19.     Research, technology transfer, and extension are public goods with spillover effects to non-Program
areas. As is planned in the PforR operation, private sector investment can be incorporated in research and
extension where sufficient private benefits can be captured to make investments economically viable. The PforR

                                                       118
operation is designed to reinforce and strengthen the government’s own systems for delivery of key agricultural
services, while putting in place processes to expand the role of the private sector in service provision. With
respect to agricultural research and related knowledge-generation activities, these activities are nonexcludable,
therefore making them classical public goods. At the same time, PSTA 3 will endeavor to expand the range of
actors in promoting agricultural research, including the private sector, for higher-value crops.

IV.      World Bank Added Value

20.      World Bank financing in support of PSTA 3 would add comparative value given the Bank’s position to
draw upon a wealth of global experience in the following areas: (i) sustainable land management; (ii) input
provision; (iii) increased irrigation in marshland and hillside approaches in support of increasing agriculture
production and productivity; (iv) fostering of a more conducive policy environment for stimulating the private
sector’s role and investments in the agriculture sector; (v) increased marketing and sales of agriculture production
and creation of on- and off-farm small and micro businesses; and (vi) provision of advice to the GoR on adapting
relevant good practices and innovations to the Rwandan context. These experiences would support the GoR’s
effective implementation of PSTA 3, thereby contributing to achievements of strategic impact, outcome, and
output level targets, underpinned by a strong results chain.

21.      Achievements from the successful implementation of ongoing World Bank-supported operations in the
sector provide a strong foundation upon which to prepare this proposed operation. Both the Rural Sector Support
Project (RSSP) and the Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project (LWH) achieved
commendable results in helping to transform Rwanda’s rural farming sector. Under RSSP 1 and 2 (now closed)
and the ongoing RSSP 3, farmers moved from low-value subsistence farming to a more productive irrigated
system. Under RSSP, impressive improvements were made in marshland rehabilitation and protection of hillsides
against erosion. Similarly, LWH made significant contributions to raising rural incomes, increasing productivity
of hillsides, increasing crop yields, and improving participatory approaches of farmers’ organizations.

V.       Quantitative Methodology

22.     This economic assessment includes a quantitative cost-benefit analysis of nine SPs and qualitative
discussion of the remaining 15 SPs. An Excel-based cash flow model was designed to assess the ex-ante
productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of public sector investments in different SPs using the ASIP medium-
cost funding scenario of US$1,195 million over five years, as shown in Table A7.1 (equivalent to ASIP public
sector estimate of US$1,214 million with inflation and projected exchange rates). 92 While the costs of all SPs are
included in the analysis, the model only quantifies direct benefits for 9 of the 24 SPs – covering 77 percent of the
public sector investment. It is further assumed that the private sector and PPP investments mapped out in the
ASIP costs will occur and be economically viable, even if the costs and benefits are not quantified in this current
analysis. Some comparisons are made to the ASIP high-cost scenario, also shown in Table A7.1.

23.     The core of the analytical model estimates the impact of SP investments on revenues and costs in seven
different enterprise models and two additional benefit flows. The analytical model and associated assumptions are
an amalgamation of the Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) models used in 2013 for two World Bank
investment projects in Rwanda: LWH and RSSP. The current model therefore includes three cropping enterprises,
one livestock enterprise, and three post-harvest enterprises as described below:

      a) Cropping on irrigated hillside areas (command areas). This enterprise model includes a
         representative cropping pattern for the without- and with-Program situations. The crops include:
         avocado, banana, maize, mango, onion, tomatoes, and sorghum (see Table A7.2). Furthermore, the
         assumptions include farm-level yields, crop prices, and costs of: labor, planting, manure, fertilizer,
         chemicals, and irrigation operating and management fee, as applicable on the different crops. It is
         assumed that without the Program there is a 1 percent annual yield loss due to soil erosion. The annual
         gross margins per ha are calculated for each crop while allowing for delayed harvesting for up to two
         years after planting, and replanting of certain crops every 10 or 25 years, such as in the case of banana,
         avocado, and mango. Incremental Program impact is aggregated up by 12,300 ha developed for hillside
         irrigation. It is assumed that 5 percent of the hectares developed will be occupied by reservoirs without
         any agricultural production in the with-Program situation. It is also assumed that farmers on 95 percent
         of the area adopt the improved with-Program cropping practices, leaving 5 percent to achieve net
         benefits equivalent to those without the Program.

      b) Cropping on nonirrigated hillside areas. This enterprise model has representative cropping patterns
         for the without- and with-Program situations with the following crops: banana, beans, cassava, Irish
         potato, maize, and sorghum (see Table A7.2). As in the irrigated hillsides enterprise model, the
         assumptions include yields, crop prices and operating costs as applicable to the different nonirrigated
         crops. It is assumed that without the Program there is a 1 percent annual yield loss due to erosion.
         Annual crop margins per ha take into account replanting of bananas every 10 years and a one-year
         delay after planting before first harvest. Incremental Program impact is aggregated up by 310,854 ha
         developed for nonirrigated hillside farming. It is assumed that 5 percent of the hectares developed will
         be silt trap zones in the with-Program situation. Incremental benefits are added from producing poles,
         charcoal, forage, and grass on these areas. It is also assumed that farmers on 95 percent of the area

                                                                 120
    adopt the improved with-Program cropping practices, leaving 5 percent to achieve net benefits
    equivalent to those without the Program.

c) Cropping on irrigated marshlands. In this enterprise model, it is assumed that sweet potatoes are
   grown in the without-Program situation, and the irrigation development enables two seasons of paddy
   rice. As in the irrigated hillsides enterprise model, the assumptions include yields, crop prices, and
   operating costs as applicable for sweet potatoes and paddy rice. Incremental Program impact is
   aggregated up by 13,500 ha developed for marshland irrigation. It is assumed that 5 percent of the
   hectares developed will be occupied by reservoirs without any agricultural production in the with-
   Program situation. It is also assumed that farmers on 95 percent of the area adopt the improved with-
   Program cropping practices, leaving 5 percent to achieve net benefits equivalent to those without the
   Program.

d) Livestock cooperatives producing meat, milk, and manure. Because data were more readily
   available at the cooperative level, net benefits of cow production were calculated for a single
   cooperative and aggregated up to the Program level based on the number of cooperatives involved in
   cow production. Individual farmers remain the direct beneficiaries from the cow production activities.
   This enterprise model includes herd projections and prices per head of calves and cows; milk and
   manure yields; and operating costs for veterinary care, forage, feed concentrates, stud fees, labor, and
   construction and maintenance of stables and forage installations. It is assumed that each cooperative in
   the without-Program situation has a total herd of 465 heads (cows, bulls, and calves) based on annual
   purchase of 35 heifers for a stable herd. The Program target is to distribute 210,796 higher-yielding
   cows, which when divided by 900 cooperatives constitutes 47 heifers per year for five years. This
   builds up to a stable herd of 653 heads per cooperative. It is also assumed that 95 percent of the
   cooperatives adopt the improved with-Program livestock production practices, leaving 5 percent to
   achieve net benefits equivalent to those in the without-Program situation.

e) Post-harvest drying of crops on new drying floors. Use of Program-financed drying floors ensures
   faster and more complete drying of crops, thereby reducing storage losses and improving the quality of
   products so they can command higher prices in the market. The benefit of investing in each drying floor
   is assumed to constitute an average of 225 tonnes/month for four months of the year with a 10 percent

                                                  121
            quantity loss avoided and 10 percent price loss avoided. The value of the benefit is measured as the full
            drying capacity multiplied by the weighted average of prices of the share of crops that are typically
            dried, including paddy rice, sorghum, maize, and beans. Operating costs include materials and labor.

       f) Post-harvest storage of crops in new facilities. Use of Program-financed storage facilities reduces
          storage losses and allows crops to be sold at higher prices compared to those prevailing immediately
          following the harvest. The benefit of investing in each storage facility is assumed to constitute an
          average of 400 tonnes/month for two 3-month periods of the year with a 20 percent quantity loss
          avoided and 20 percent price loss avoided. The value of the benefit is measured as the full storage
          capacity multiplied by the weighted average of prices of the share of crops that are typically stored,
          including paddy rice, maize, beans, sorghum, banana, and vegetables. Operating costs include materials
          and labor.

       g) Post-harvest transport on new or improved feeder roads. Net benefits are calculated as a 5 percent
          avoided post-harvest transport loss due to new and improved feeder roads multiplied by the value of
          with-Program transported crops, including paddy rice, maize, beans, sorghum, banana, and vegetables.
          Further to this, it is assumed that this investment can yield a 5 percent reduction in input costs of seed,
          fertilizer, and chemicals for farmers. These cost savings are captured in the above cropping models.
          The estimated benefits from feeder road investments exclude any additional benefits captured by non-
          Program agricultural production and other sectors as well as benefits to communities by providing
          easier access to health, education, and social facilities.

       h) Employment opportunities in agriculture. The incremental labor costs accounted for in the three
          cropping models, livestock model, and post-harvest drying and storage facilities are included as net
          benefits from greater employment opportunities in agriculture. This excludes any multiplier effects in
          other agribusinesses or other sectors. It also excludes labor generated from construction during Program
          implementation. For cropping farms in the without-Program situation or when there is no irrigation, it
          is assumed that 10 percent of the labor requirements are hired labor. On farms with irrigation, this is 50
          percent.

       i)   Economic value of increased carbon sequestration. The links between land degradation and CO2
            emissions are numerous and complex, but studies from some countries suggest that sustainable land
            management (SLM) measures such as those that have been supported under the LWH project
            contribute to CO2 mitigation by at least 0.5 tonnes of carbon per ha per year (or 1.785 tonnes of CO2
            per ha per year using a 3.57 transformation ratio). The estimate of 0.5 tonnes of C was used in the
            Kenya Agricultural Productivity and SLM Project and the Western Kenya Community Driven
            Development and Flood Mitigation Project. It can go as high as 12 tonnes of C from 5-year-old forest
            land used in the Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project and even as high as 20
            tonnes of C for regenerated closed areas to 40 tonnes of C for afforested land used in the Loess Plateau
            Watershed Rehabilitation Project. In the current analysis it is assumed that nonirrigated areas sequester
            0.5 tonnes of carbon per ha per year while silt trap zones sequester 12 tonnes of C per ha per year. In
            terms of valuing sequestered C or CO2, activities that result in increased carbon sequestration in
            Biocarbon Fund projects in 2009 typically were compensated at a level of US$5 per tonne of CO 2.
            Estimates of social price in different studies indicate US$5-125 per tonne CO2.93 From the literature on
            carbon finance, this can be interpreted as the social cost of CO2 emission or as a pollution tax required
            to keep CO2 emissions at the socially optimal level. In this Program, farmers will not receive direct

              compensation based on carbon sequestration and the benefit therefore only constitutes an economic
              value for a global public benefit. As a conservative estimate and, in line with the European Point
              Carbon price at the time of writing, the assumed value of carbon sequestration is set at US$7 per tonne
              of CO2.

24.     Adjustment factors for economic analysis. An economic benefit assessment is concerned with value
addition to GDP and therefore ignores all transfer payments such as taxes, subsidies, grants, loans, interests, and
repayments. Each of the above seven enterprise models and two benefit flows are calculated annually over a 25-
year period using financial prices measured at the farm gate in constant 2014 amounts. The discount rate is set to
12 percent in line with the assumption in other World Bank projects in Rwanda. Financial prices and costs are
converted to economic prices using adjustment factors. First, the shadow price of unpaid family labor is US$0.98
per day (RwF 634 per day), which is 14 percent below the market price of US$1.14 per day (RwF 740 per day)
for unskilled hired labor used in agricultural production, in line with the Implementation Completion Report of
RSSP 2. Second, the economic paddy rice price is assumed to be 80 percent of the financial price due to the
import tariff imposed on imported rice from outside the East African Community (EAC). This is in line with
findings in a rice value chain study. 94 Third, the financial analysis includes the current 50 percent fertilizer
subsidy on maize and wheat while the subsidy is excluded from the economic analysis. Remaining financial
prices and costs are converted to economic prices using a standard factor of 0.9. When investment costs do not
indicate the proportion allocated to labor, it is assumed that 15 percent of the costs are labor in order to apply a
different conversion factor to the two portions.

25.     Additional model refinements are implemented to analyze prioritization between SPs. The analytical
model outlined thus far enables an assessment of the ex-ante productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of public
sector investments overall and by SP for the base ASIP medium-cost case. However, a few more model
refinements are necessary to be able to analyze the impact of reallocating funds between SPs and thus discuss
budget prioritization.

26.      Linkages between SP investment costs and key enterprise model assumptions help quantify the
relative impact of SPs. Through the enterprise models described above, the key linkages to agricultural growth
are quantified in that changes in public sector investment costs lead to changes in: the number of developed
hectares with terracing or irrigation; the number of higher-yielding cows distributed; the number of infrastructures
built for post-harvest drying and storage; and the extent of new or improved feeder roads. However, to further
enable an analysis of the relative return of different SPs, some additional linkages are implemented in the
analytical model. These linkages go across SPs and show the impact on: crop yields, input use and costs, and
adoption of improved farming practices. These captured linkages are described below – keeping in mind that
more intricate linkages should be considered in future improvements of this analytical model. As with all farm-
level assumptions on revenue and costs, the relative contributions of each SP investment are based on expert
assessment by the LWH and RSSP project team:

          a) Irrigated hillside yields. The with-Program yield potential on irrigated hillside areas is achieved by
             investments in several SPs. As shown in Table A7.3, it is assumed that 10 percent of the yield increase
             is achieved through land conservation measures (terracing), 25 percent from irrigation, 5 percent from
             mechanization, and 20 percent to each of the SPs for improved soil fertility, seed improvement, and
             research and technology transfer. A numerical example is presented in Box 5.1. Note that the ASIP
             medium-cost area developed in SP 1.1 includes about 80 percent in progressive terraces and 20 percent
             in radical terraces. The radical terraces require large investments in manure and compost to build up
             organic matter and achieve yield improvements. If more radical terraces are built, this could be
             reflected by a higher yield impact than the 10 percent being allocated to SP 1.1.

       b) Nonirrigated hillside yields. It is assumed that the with-Program yield potential on nonirrigated
          hillsides is achieved through land conservation (10 percent), mechanization (5 percent), and 75 percent
          split evenly between improved soil fertility, seed improvement, and research and technology transfer
          (see Table A7.3). A numerical example is presented in Box A7.1.

       c) Irrigated marshland yields. As shown in Table A7.3, the with-Program potential yield increase is
          achieved through irrigation (25 percent), mechanization (5 percent), and the remaining 70 percent split
          evenly between improved soil fertility, seed improvement, and research and technology transfer. A
          numerical example is presented in Box 5.1.

       d) Linkages to input use and input costs. 95
             i. Soil erosion and downstream irrigation fee. It is assumed that a change in investments in
                land conservation (terracing) leads to a proportional change in the irrigation fee per ha for
                farmers. The rationale is that less terracing than planned does not reduce soil erosion as
                planned and a high level of sediment load increases the costs of maintaining downstream
                irrigation systems. This model linkage assumes that at least some of the incremental
                maintenance costs are passed on to farmers via the irrigation fee.
            ii. Mechanization and labor savings. It is assumed that the investment in tractors, tillers,
                planters, harvesters, and so on can lead to a 15 percent per ha labor saving on farms. Most of
                the mechanization investment costs are included in SP 1.3 and some are also included in SP
                3.8. The assumption is that 80 percent and 20 percent of the labor saving potential is achieved
                by the two SPs, respectively. For example, a 10 percent reduction in SP 1.3 means that only 92
                percent of the labor saving potential is achieved (i.e., 14 percent labor saving rather than the
                full 15 percent).
           iii. Fertilizer and seed use. The model linkages include a proportional change in fertilizer use in
                kg per ha for crops in all areas when the investment costs change in SP 1.4. It also includes a
                proportional change in seed use in kg or plants per ha when the investment costs change in SP
                1.5. This comes parallel to the yield change discussed above from changes in SP investments.
           iv.  Feeder roads and input cost savings. It is assumed that if rural feeder roads are developed as
                planned, farmers can achieve a 5 percent cost saving on the costs of seeds, fertilizers, and
                chemicals. A reduction in SP 3.8 investment causes a proportional reduction in achieved cost
                saving.

       e) Adoption of improved farming practices. It is assumed that in the base case, 20 percent of farmers on
          developed areas adopt the improved farming practices each year to a maximum of 95 percent, leaving 5
          percent to achieve net benefits equivalent only to the without-Program situation. This adoption rate is
          linked to investment costs in SP 2.2 for extension services. A reduction in investment in this SP leads
          to a proportional reduction in the annual adoption rate. This is illustrated in Figure A7.1, showing the
          adopters, nonadopters, and silt trap zones on nonirrigated hillsides with 20 percent and 10 percent
          annual adoption rates.

  For future considerations in developing this model, one could consider the legitimacy of introducing multiplicative functions to capture
the investment impacts. For example, this may imply that investing less in soil fertility (fertilizer use) may also lead to less seed use.
Similarly, if soil erosion increases due to lack of terraces, fertilizer use will be less effective but seed use may not change equivalently.
Further work is needed to obtain data to determine such functional relationships.

                                                   Box A7.1: Numerical Illustration of Model Linkages - Yield Impacts by SP
Table A7.3 shows how a number of SP investments are linked to key assumptions in the enterprise models. This
is done to capture the effect investments have on the progress towards the maximum yield potential. Each crop
has its own assumed maximum yield potential in each cropping area. The implication is that if investments are
reduced in one of the SPs, the maximum yield potential is not reached.

For example: If the soil fertility SP's share of the ASIP investment halves from 6 percent to 3 percent, the
maximum with-Program yield on irrigated hillsides will decrease by 50 percent of the 20 percent share allocated
to soil fertility, equal to a 10 percent reduction. This means that one only reaches 90 percent of the yield
potential on irrigated hillside crops.

At the same time, that investment cost change leads to a 50 percent decrease of 28 percent of the maximum yield
potential on nonirrigated areas, equal to a 14 percent reduction. This means that one only reaches 86 percent of
the yield potential on nonirrigated areas.

And finally, the 50 percent decrease in investment in SP 1.4 would halve 23 percent of the maximum yield
potential on irrigated marshlands. This means that one only reaches 88 percent of the yield potential on irrigated
marshlands.

VI.      Quantitative Analysis of Key Subprograms

27.      This section presents the main results of the economic assessment. First, the results are measured
through proxy indicators for growth in agricultural GDP and poverty reduction through growth in income and
employment. Second, results show how the different SPs rank in terms of driving the overall return on investment
and employment generation. These items are covered first as they are of particular interest for prioritizing the
government's investment between SPs. Third, other key results are discussed including: synergies between
different SPs as well as the impact of Program delay and other risk factors. The unit costs of different SP activities
are also discussed. Finally, the results are presented for the ASIP high-cost scenario.

28.     There is a sound return on public sector investment in the ASIP medium-cost scenario contributing
to agricultural growth. Estimates for the ASIP medium-cost scenario indicate that the planned US$1.2 billion
five-year investment yields a sound overall economic NPV of US$585 million with an ERR of 21 percent. As
shown in Table A7.10, the estimated 21 percent ERR lies within the range of rates of returns calculated on
existing and closed investment projects in Rwanda and other Sub-Saharan African countries as implemented
through different organizations (ERRs ranging from 14-93 percent on projects with a varying combinations of soil
conservation, irrigation, and post-harvest components). Annual net benefits are shown in Table A7.11 and Table
A7.12 for the financial and economic values, respectively. Note that these estimates are based on the 25-year
model, which includes recurrent investment costs in year 6 and onwards from the ASIP cost estimate.
Undiscounted, this is equivalent to an average annual economic net benefit of US$196 million (excluding carbon
sequestration). Using this estimate as a proxy for annual growth in the agriculture sector, this constitutes 8.0
percent of the agricultural share of GDP.96 The analysis seems generally consistent with an 8.5 percent growth
target for the sector. In addition, this analysis does not capture incremental benefits from other enterprises,
including those further up the value chain. Additional benefits will also be achieved outside the Program area but
have not been accounted for here.

29.      Poverty reduction through farm-level income growth. The ASIP medium-cost scenario drives a
change in cropping pattern and farm management practices that greatly improve farm-level income. As shown in
Table A7.4, estimates indicate a 77 percent increase in per ha gross margin on nonirrigated hillsides, and much
larger increases on irrigated areas as shown in the table. With an average farm size of 0.6 ha, household incomes
could increase by between US$320 and US$2,200 per year. If one assumes an average farm household of five
people, this increase in income constitutes about 0.3 to 2.3 times the poverty line for Rwanda, or US$0.20-1.20
per person per day. 97 When targeting poor farmers, poverty can be reduced by increasing household income
through increased productivity and also by switching more to cash crops such as maize and rice. These estimates
are based on the cropping patterns shown in Table A7.2. For example, if the nonirrigated with-Program pattern
instead included 23 percent banana and 1 percent beans, the gross margin would have increased by 123 percent
rather than 77 percent. As such, the income effects will vary from area to area and farm to farm. Note that as is
appropriate in a financial and economic analysis, the gross margins presented in Table A7.4 exclude the cost of
the farmer's own labor. Further to this, the increased gross margins will help motivate farmers to adopt improved
technologies. This is discussed further below.

                 (3) The Rwanda extreme poverty line in 2012 prices was RwF 83,000 per person per year; converted to 2014
                 prices, it is US$135.

30.     Poverty reduction through generation of agricultural employment. Under the ASIP medium-cost
scenario, the NPV of increased agricultural employment due to changes only in cropping, livestock, and drying
and storage facilities was estimated at US$39 million. The average economic net benefit was US$7.5 million per
year, which is equivalent to 7.7 million work days with a daily economic wage rate of US$0.98/day. If one
assumes 260 work days in a year, this translates to about 29,400 person-years, or with 130 work days in a year,
over 58,800 person-years. This includes increases due to cropping intensification particularly on irrigated areas,
decreases from mechanization, and increased livestock production, as well as employment in new drying and
storage facilities. This is a conservative estimate and excludes employment generation in other agricultural
production systems including export commodity chain and post-harvest businesses as well as labor for
constructing terraces, irrigation systems, post-harvest infrastructure, and rural feeder roads. It also excludes any
multiplier effects on employment inside and outside the Program area due to improved roads.98

31.     According to estimated elasticities, overall return to public sector investment is driven particularly
by investments in soil conservation, research, and soil fertility. To quantify the relative return on investment
from different SPs, elasticities were calculated instead of using absolute or proportional measures, with the
difference shown in equations 1, 2, and 3:
               Absolute:         dY = NPVcase - NPVbase                                          (eq. 1)
               Proportional: dY/Y = (NPVcase - NPVbase)/ NPVbase                                 (eq. 2)
                                                 n    n
               Elasticity:       E = (dY/Y) / (dX / X ) = dY/Y / (Costcase - Costbase)/ Costbase (eq. 3)
        where
               dY = Change in NPV
               Y = Estimated NPV
               E = Elasticity measure of NPV from changes in investment cost assumptions
               dXn = Change in investment costs in subprogram n
               Xn = Investment costs in subprogram n



98
   For example, according to the RSSP2 Implementation Completion Report, the summary of findings from stakeholder consultations
(Nov. 29 – Dec. 1, 2012) indicated that job creation had occurred both temporarily through construction activities and permanently through
intensification. While there were emerging labor shortages during the peak season of crop activities, there had been use of community labor
groups to cover labor shortages.

                                                                   127
In line with a typical interpretation of elasticities and to explore the result's sensitivity to changes in investment
level, the costs in each of the nine SPs were decreased by 1 percent from the ASIP medium-cost scenario. Table
A7.5 shows that the economic NPV for the entire Program is most sensitive to changes in investments in land
conservation (SP 1.1) and research (SP 2.1), where a 1 percent decrease in investment leads to a 1.6 percent or 1.2
percent reduction in economic NPV, respectively. There is also a relatively large impact of 0.9 percent when
changing the investment in soil fertility (SP 1.4) by 1 percent. This result is driven partly by land conservation
increasing yields, reducing soil erosion, and also by covering a large share of the developed area. It is also driven
by the assumed linkages between SPs and yields in Table A7.3. It is worth noting that the negative relationship
with investment level in market-oriented infrastructure (SP 3.8) needs to be investigated further; however, it is
most likely because this SP is dominated by investments in rural feeder roads, for which only a part of the benefits
have been quantified.

               (3) The economic labor rate used to value increased employment is RwF 634/day or US$0.98/day.

32.     According to estimated elasticities, the impact on employment in the agriculture sector is driven
particularly by investments in livestock development, irrigation, and mechanization. Equation 3 is also used
to calculate how different SPs impact employment generation. A 1 percent increase in investments in livestock
(SP 1.6) and irrigation (SP 1.2) increase employment the most, with elasticities of 1.4 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively (see Table A7.5). As can be expected, the SP for mechanization (SP 1.3) reduces the employment
benefit due to labor savings from investing in tractors, planters, and other equipment.

33.     Most of the Program returns are from nonirrigated hillsides and livestock production, which
together constitute 29 percent of the five-year investment costs. While investments on nonirrigated hillsides
cover 22 percent of the five-year investment costs, they generate US$257 million of the Program returns
measured in economic NPV. Moreover, the analysis shows that most of the net benefits on hillsides are driven by
the improved gross margins and not just the avoided yield loss (refers to the empirical finding that reduction of
soil erosion will generate about a 1 percent increase in yields). From 7 percent of the public investment costs,
improved livestock production generates another US$440 million of the economic NPV (see Table A7.6). Some
enterprise models are close to or do not break even at a 12 percent discount rate, including storage facilities and
feeder roads. This is discussed further below with respect to unit investment costs and benefits that have not been
captured in this analysis. ERRs for a range of similar investment projects are listed in Table A7.10. Care should
be taken when comparing returns due to different sizes of investments, the year in which the analyses were done,
and the complexity of the projects compared to individual enterprise models.

34.      Positive synergies with livestock production. As seen by the high return on investment in livestock
development, projects such as the LWH and RSSP show that investments in terracing lead to increased livestock
production due to higher farmer income as well as the availability of fodder and straw from silt trap zones.
Subsequently, the increased availability of manure benefited the local cropping systems and for building organic
matter on new radical terraces. In the LWH project it is emphasized that availability of fodder for livestock and
improved access to water for livestock are incentives for farmers to diversify and expand their livestock
enterprises and enhance adoption rates of improved breeds which are early maturing and high yielders. Finally it
is noted that, in the case of RSSP, significant net benefits were also captured by beneficiaries who stocked
irrigation reservoirs with fish.

35.      The net benefit from investments in storage facilities is dependent on a successful implementation
of SPs that increase crop yields and prices. The returns on investments in post-harvest infrastructure are highly
dependent not only on their ability to avoid yield/price losses, but also on the value of the crops that are dried and
stored. It is assumed that all facilities are used to their full capacity as described in Section V. 99 The value of the
avoided yield and price losses are weighted averages of the obtained crop prices. While the NPVs of infrastructure
investments are too small to have a significant impact overall, their individual rates of return should be explored
to ensure that they are viable businesses. As shown in Table A7.6, the 11 percent ERR on storage facilities is
marginal compared to a discount rate of 12 percent. The main crops that are stored are paddy rice and maize. So
to achieve sufficient return on post-harvest investments, it is important to invest in other SPs to achieve the
potential yields and prices. This is necessary to shift away from basic production practices towards higher value
chain activities, including those with an export focus. Note that this analytical model currently does not include an
enterprise model for export crops such as tea, coffee, or flowers.

36.     Program delay and low farmer adoption rates are key risk factors that can threaten the
achievement of expected benefits. As indicated in the risk framework, MINAGRI plans to monitor the
implementation of terracing and irrigation schemes to avoid delays and thereby maximize Program returns. In
addition, returns to Program investments are particularly sensitive to delays in improving livestock production and
building post-harvest facilities and feeder roads. It is also important how many farmers ultimately adopt the new

99
   To investigate possible shortages or excess capacities, future refinements of the analysis should investigate the existing and new
capacity for drying and storage versus the increase in crop production achieved by the program.

                                                                    129
farming practices and how fast they do so. The original assumption is that 95 percent of the farmers adopt new
practices eventually. Adoption rates from other projects range from 70-80 percent.100 In the current model, a 70
percent final adoption rate leads to an economic NPV of US$376 million and a reasonable ERR of 16 percent. A
switching values analysis shows that the break-even point for the investment is when adoption only reaches 56
percent of the total developed area – compared to the assumed 95 percent. The NPV also drops to zero if the
annual adoption rate drops to 7 percent compared to the assumed 20 percent, thereby delaying incremental
benefits. A farmer's incentive to adopt the new farming practices is driven by the increase in gross margins as well
as sufficient extension services. As shown in Table A7.4, the gross margin incentives are strong on irrigated areas,
but the smaller gross margin increase on nonirrigated areas may not be sufficient to encourage adoption.101 Risk
management strategies should ensure minimum Program delay while also increasing farmer adoption rates
through extension for improved with-Program gross margins.

37.      Reduced livestock and hillside revenues are also potential risk factors. Because a large share of total
Program returns are generated by livestock production and crops on nonirrigated hillsides, the switching values
analysis shows that results are somewhat sensitive to changes in the associated milk yields, crop yields, and
operating costs. For example, the economic NPV becomes zero if the milk yield per head of cow falls by 50
percent from 8 to 4 liters/head/day, which is the same as the without-Program milk yield. Similarly, it takes a 64-
75 percent drop in maize or Irish potato yields or prices before the economic NPV becomes zero. As set out in
Table A7.3, yield increases are supported particularly through SPs for soil fertility, seed improvement, and
research and technology transfer - and separately also livestock development. The relative impact of these SPs is
illustrated in the elasticity analysis in Table A7.5.

38.     Incremental benefits of the public sector's share of investment in research, technology transfer, and
extension have been captured through increased productivity and farmer adoption in the quantitative
analysis. Benefits are estimated through: improved gross margins at the farm level, technology adoption rates,
and avoided post-harvest yield loss. An elasticity factor of 1.2 percent and 0.4 percent is calculated for a 1 percent
change in research and extension investments, respectively. However, as these SPs were not quantified in separate
enterprise models, no rates of return on investment have been calculated. Examples of different investment
projects targeting research and extension have rates of return ranging from 12 percent to over 75 percent in
different countries, indicating potentially large impacts on agricultural growth (see Table A7.7).

39.     The estimated rates of return are higher on nonirrigated areas compared to irrigated areas because
the assumed incremental benefits are not large enough to outweigh the higher unit costs of establishing
irrigation systems compared to terrace construction. In addition, as pointed out in the RSSP 2 Implementation
Completion Report and in CAADP 2 Background Study #1 (Stryker et al. 2014), hillside irrigation is more
expensive than marshland irrigation due to the size requirement for dams as well as extra costs to line the main
canals and to build a secondary pipe network. As shown in Table A7.8, unit costs vary greatly between areas and
countries.

40.       The ASIP high-cost scenario has 54 percent higher investment than the medium-cost scenario and
yields a 54 percent higher economic NPV but a lower ERR of 21 percent. Because of the focus on irrigation
and livestock in the high-cost scenario, employment generation increased by 17 percent in spite of
increased mechanization. So far, the analysis has focused on the ASIP medium-cost scenario. In general, the so-
called high-cost scenario is larger in scope by increasing investments in post-harvest infrastructure as well as
program 1 for sustainable agriculture and animal resource intensification. Total public sector investment costs are
54 percent higher than in the medium-cost scenario. However, less is invested in research, extension, and the
remaining SPs including value chain development (see Table A7.1). To analyze this, two main assumptions were
made. First, farm-level cropping patterns and gross margins remain unchanged from the medium-cost scenario
and the higher investment increases the size of the developed area. Second, because the high-cost scenario
assumes a 50 percent higher unit cost in distributed cows under SP 1.6, milk yields increase by 25 percent.
Otherwise, using the same model as above, the high-cost scenario of a 5-year US$1.8 billion investment yielded
an economic NPV of US$898 million and an ERR of 21 percent. As such, the economic NPV is 54 percent higher
than in the medium-cost scenario. The average annual net benefits in the high-cost scenario are US$303 million,
which constitutes 12.4 percent of the agriculture share of GDP. This exceeds the 8.5 percent growth target. The
result follows the pattern of the earlier elasticity analysis where net benefit from public sector investment is most
sensitive to changes in research and technology transfer together with irrigation development and efforts toward
soil fertility. Employment generation came to 9 million work days per year or 34,400 fulltime work-years, which
is a 17 percent increase from the medium-cost scenario in spite of a higher investment in mechanization.

VII.    Qualitative Discussion of Linkages To and Between Subprograms

41.      Agriculture growth driven by the nine quantified SPs is enabled through linkages to the remaining
15 SPs, which provide market access, agricultural finance, a strengthened institutional framework, and
targeting of disadvantaged groups. By including the public sector investment costs of all SPs, it is assumed
explicitly that these are necessary investments to drive agricultural growth. These SPs include key activities such
as: developing farmers’ cooperatives; supporting value chain development; and enabling acces s to markets,
finance, and insurance. The institutional development and cross-cutting issues are similarly linked to the
successful outcome of all other SPs. As noted in the methodology and results, the incremental benefits of those 15
SPs were not quantified because of lack of time and resources to obtain the necessary information for such an
analysis. These SPs are an integral part of the investment to transform Rwanda’s agriculture sector, and therefore
the analysis includes the 23 percent they constitute of the total public sector investment. The result is that the net
returns discussed earlier are understated, given the undeniable incremental benefits from these 15 other SPs.

42.     Support for farmers' organizations helps improve access to inputs, markets, finance, insurance, and
extension services. Many of the benefits captured in the cropping and livestock models assume functioning
markets for both farm inputs and outputs. The ability of farmers to obtain support from farmers' cooperatives and
organizations affects how and at what cost they can obtain the necessary planting materials, fertilizer, chemicals,
and extension services as well as irrigation services through WUAs, such as those as first established in RSSP 2.
As pointed out in the risk framework, these benefits are currently captured by a few better-off farmers. At the
same time, marginal smallholders and women farmers do not benefit much from agricultural commercialization.
With increased investment in this area through SP 2.3, the aim is to establish more farmers' organizations and
strengthen existing ones in management, post-harvest handling, and improved access to finance and agricultural
insurance, especially for disadvantaged groups. No specific examples have been found on estimated return on
investments in strengthening farmers' organizations because this is typically an integral and necessary part of rural
development projects, not a separable component.

43.      To increase growth in the agriculture sector, investments are also planned for value chain
development and private sector investment (SP 3.1-3.8), of which the quantitative analysis has only covered
incremental benefits from market-oriented infrastructure. Many of the assumed yields and prices incorporated in
the analysis rely on access to markets via value chains for crops, dairy, and meat. In addition, increased
productivity and cropping patterns toward cash crops can also target export crops in line with the strategic plan.
This requires having access to improved drying, storage, and also transport, all key to be able to meet higher
quality standards and sell perishable products to other than local markets. As shown in Table A7.9, 77 percent of
the private sector investments as part of the ASIP medium-cost scenario target value chain development and
include 39 percent of the PPPs. As stated in the methodology, it is assumed that these additional investments will
occur and will be economically viable, even if the costs and benefits are not quantified in this current analysis.

44.      Investments in SPs 4.1-4.3 help strengthen institutional development to support transfer of new
technologies to farmers. The impact of investments in research, technology transfer, and extension rely on
effective institutions that can implement research programs and ensure farmer adoption of improved technologies
and farming practices. Decentralizing service delivery can improve the relevancy to farmers as well as improve
farm-level adoption rates. It is therefore important that investments in institutional capacity building and also the
legal and regulatory framework continue to enable transfer of both national and internationally available
technologies to farmers (SPs 4.1-4.3).

45.     To transform the agriculture sector toward higher value chains including exports, the legal and
regulatory system needs to be strengthened and adapted. The planned value chain development will require a
more efficient import and export market for both farm inputs and outputs. This includes improving border control,
using SPS measures, and certifying imports and exports. Investments to establish a system for registering farm
inputs and plant breeders’ rights will enable higher farm productivity as well as access to improved seeds and
planting materials.

46.     Investments that increase productivity may be subject to elite capture unless parallel efforts are
made to ensure that disadvantaged groups are also reached. Investments in SPs 4.5-4.7 will ensure that
disadvantaged groups are targeted by building capacity for mainstreaming gender issues in future projects and by
targeting youth employment in the sector. Because of the complexity of the terracing and irrigation developments
with respect to environmental impact, SP 4.6 builds capacity in the agriculture sector to manage future
investments that take environmental externalities into account. While increased productivity in other SPs helps
improve food and nutrition security, the final SP targets the most disadvantaged groups by ensuring that some
benefits are captured directly by poor households.

47.      Tracking impacts against a baseline through reliable M&E systems helps decision makers and DPs
make evidence-based investment decisions. To ensure that the Program investment is sound and stays on target,
it is important to track impacts against a baseline. SP 4.4 investments are needed to establish the baseline against
which impacts are measured and to assess if the investment priorities should change over time as new information
comes to light. By establishing a statistical system and a targeted M&E system, it becomes possible to implement
sound investments in the future based on timely and reliable information. Communication of results and impacts
also helps DPs and beneficiaries make informed investment decisions.

Inputs to the Program Action Plan (PAP) and Rationale

1.      In reviewing the strategic objectives, outcomes, outputs, and activities for each PSTA 3
subprogram (SP), and in discussion with counterparts, relevant actions to be undertaken by the
Borrower to address key areas for improvement and/or activities of high importance to catalyze the
achievement of the key PSTA 3 results were identified during the technical assessment . These
actions serve as inputs to the PAP, and consist of three types of actions: i) changes to the technical
dimensions of the Program and to the formal rules and procedures governing the organization and
management of the systems used to implement the Program; ii) actions to enhance the capacity and
performance of the implementing agencies involved; and iii) risk-mitigating measures to increase the
potential for the Program to achieve its results and to address fiduciary, social, and environmental system
concerns. Below are potential actions as inputs into the preparation of an “expanded” PAP and to support
timely and effective implementation of the overall PSTA 3.

Program 1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

2.      Agricultural mechanization. A detailed roadmap for government to draw down its investment in
mechanization and promote private sector investment should be elaborated. How the private sector
investment could complement existing efforts by the government to achieve the 25 percent coverage by
2018 should be detailed. Additionally, the government should set in motion a strategy to create an
enabling policy environment for investment and provide extension services and capacity building on
mechanization to relevant stakeholders. The integration of the mechanization and irrigation taskforce into
RAB and subsequent assimilation of its activities should be finalized.

3.      Agrochemical use and markets. To create a competitive fertilizer marketing sector, the
government should promote more private sector participation beyond the current three companies to
import and distribute fertilizers in the country. Mechanisms to ensure quality assurance at the retail level,
which might include recruiting of staff and training in fertilizer sampling, testing, and analysis in
accredited laboratories should be elaborated. An updated fertilizer policy and its effective implementation
would play an important role.

4.       Seed development. A strategy to promote private sector investment in the seed sector beyond the
current three companies should be elaborated. Since RAB also produces seed, the GoR should take steps
to relocate the seed inspection function from RAB to MINAGRI to avoid a potential conflict of interest.
Strengthening the capacity of the seed regulatory body should be given priority. Again, an updated seeds
policy would pull together various initiatives and play an important role in realizing the potential
benefits from seeds.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

5.      Research, technology transfer and extension services for producers. Finalize restructuring of
RAB, including an action plan on addressing the capacity gaps and enhancing research-extension linkages
(MINAGRI and RAB). The M&E capacity, including data processing and arrangements for reporting for
research and technology transfer, and for targets set under food crops are in existence but need to be
strengthened. This would form a part of the enhanced MIS for the agriculture sector (discussed above).
While the results set under research and extension are straightforward to measure and report, measuring
and reporting the yield results at the national level is more demanding. A reliable and elaborate structure
and system to capture and process the data on production, productivity levels, and area under different
crops is currently not in place, and therefore needs to be well developed. The action plan to improve the
M&E system at various levels and institutions will address these issues.


                                                    141
6.      Farmers’ Cooperatives and Organizations. Detailed operational guidelines for implementing
new decentralized approach for cooperatives and farmer-to-farmer extension model (MINAGRI/RAB).
Finalize capacity-building strategy and plan for cooperatives/farmers’ organizations and staff and LSPs
(MINAGRI/RAB). Baseline of current 1,877 cooperatives/farmers’ organizations and designing of
monitoring and tracking system (MINAGRI/RAB).

Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

7.       Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship and
facilitate market access. Conduct/review market demand analysis for each priority export value chain
and incorporate findings in Ag. PforR program planning/NAEB’s strategic plan for 2013-18 (NAEB).

8.      Development of priority food crop value chains. There is need to strengthen M&E systems and
capacity at the District and national levels to capture and analyze data on production and area under
different crops and yields. This will ensure that that the DLIs and indictors are well monitored and
reported on by MINAGRI, RAB, and LG.

9.       Development of priority export crop value chains. The specific objectives of increasing overall
production, productivity, and value addition in target value chains as well as creating an enabling
environment conducive to increased private sector participation are well aligned with the set target for
increasing the value of exports in priority value chains by 28 percent p.a. by 2018. However, a more in-
depth understanding needs to be developed in terms of mid-term market demand dynamics expected for
each value chain as well as a clearer prioritization among the various levers available to the government
(i.e., expansion, intensification, value addition) in terms of achieving the export growth target in a
sustainable way. How much of this target will come from intensification and how much is expected from
expansion in terms of contribution to achieving the target? Early engagement with the private sector
suggests intensification should be considered a first priority over expansion, given Rwanda’s land
constrained environment, particularly for well-established, more traditional export value chains (tea and
coffee). Intensification efforts could very well be supplemented by expansion based on a clear value
proposition for farmers in target areas. There is also more clarity needed regarding the areas in which FDI
is required and in what volume to achieve targets. For all these export sectors, the target areas for planned
expansion of production need to be reviewed from a poverty reduction and social risk standpoint, as it
involves farmers switching from predominantly food crops to cash crops. Intensive training support may
be required as these farmers move into producing new crops for which they lack experience. For
investment promotion-related activities, NAEB will have to work closely with RDB, the focal point
institution for investment promotion and facilitation in Rwanda. For reviewing and updating the
regulatory framework for export value chains, it will have to work closely with MINAGRI as the main
policy-setting institution.

10.      Agricultural finance. Major action items for the agricultural finance and legal basis for
agricultural catalytic fund SPs should be to: i) develop a proposal on immediate support to enhance the
institutional capacity to oversee, formulate, and support agricultural finance policies in MINAGRI and
carry out the specific action items listed under the RF; ii) develop and sign an MOU with Access to
Finance Rwanda (AFR) with targeted responsibilities for achieving some of the results under the relevant
expected outcomes of the RF; iii) develop clear links between the RF and outcomes through thorough
demand assessments and analysis of the status of the private sector, and likely private sector response to
the proposed interventions under the relevant outcome; iv) provide appropriate mitigation measures for
the risks listed above; v) design a program of public support for agriculture insurance in Rwanda based on
a comparative study of agriculture insurance schemes globally; vi) identify the implementation
arrangements, with private insurers as candidates for participation in the program, and have a system to


                                                    142
bring on board other insurers; and vii) build consensus amongst government, donor community, and
private sector stakeholders.

11.      Market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest. Promote efficient and equitable transport
systems. MINAGARI, MINIFRA and Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) have capacity-
building activities102 within each sector program and should be sufficient to strengthen the Districts and
national entities responsible for feeder roads oversight. There is also a need to strengthen the planning,
collaboration, and prioritization of road investments among the various stakeholder government
ministries, such as MINAGRI, MINIFRA, and MINALOC, in the context of the budgetary planning
processes. Support and oversight needs to be provided to confirm that capacity-building activities are
undertaken. Greater attention is needed to enhance O&M arrangements and funding for rural
infrastructure.

12.     Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level.
Considering the appropriate roles of public and private sector, additional storage facilities vital for
enhancing food security will be built, with their number and capacity determined before the start of the
project. MINAGRI should explore the opportunity to tender the leasing of these stores and the
management of the strategic grain reserves within the stores to the private sector. MINAGRI should take
immediate steps to revise ISAR’s Post-Harvest Team to include agricultural engineers and economists. A
capacity-building program on identification and prioritization of the list of economically relevant post-
harvest technologies and dissemination strategies for ISAR’s Post-Harvest Team should be developed.

Program 4 – Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

13.      Institutional capacity building. The above mentioned capacity development (CD) assessment
exercise (to be completed by MINAGRI in 2014) is expected to consolidate an updated action plan for
enhanced capacity development at various levels (central and subnational) and actors (MINAGRI, RAB,
NAEB, SPIUs, and Districts), in terms of the program/budgetary cycle, involving: strategic planning and
prioritization, budgetary aspects, implementation, M&E (including youth- and gender-responsive
approaches), and accountability aspects (Table A8.1 illustrates the type of information expected to be
generated from this assessment exercise).




102
    Support to the Districts and national coordination entities capacity building, includes: i) technical assistance to the Districts
infrastructure, finance, procurement, environmental management, and planning units through adoption of systems and manuals
and provision of training to District staff; and ii) strengthening the capacity of national coordination entities, through provision of
training on feeder roads development planning, monitoring and maintenance for MINAGRI and RTDA staff.

                                                 Private sector


14.     Decentralization in Agriculture. Various recent reports (as cited above), especially the key
actions addressing the identified challenges, provide sound and proactive actions for enhancing the
decentralization process to enable achievement of this SO. Given the important role of the Districts in
enhancing efficiencies and effectiveness in the implementation of PSTA 3, the PAP for the Ag. PforR
support operation includes strengthening the harmonization and operationalization of an enhanced M&E
system between MINAGRI and the Districts (and this will form part MINAGRI’s action plan for
enhancing the MIS for the agriculture sector, at various levels). The above assessment of the program
cycle at the District level can provide useful inputs for the action plan for strengthening decentralization
in and “for” sustainable agriculture.

15.     The ongoing support for strengthening the further mainstreaming of decentralization in the
agriculture sector (currently being actively supported by the EU) will enhance the efficiency and
effectiveness of ongoing decentralization initiatives. This also provides a good framework for the
decentralized implementation of the recently prepared ASIP, with efforts to integrate and contextualize
relevant elements of ASIP in each District Development Plan (DDP).

16.     Develop regulations for organic agriculture, pesticide, and limestone use. Given the relative
importance of organic farming, MINAGRI should develop and implement a certification system.
Emphasis should also be placed on building the capacity of stakeholders to carry out the certification of
organic products but MINAGRI should retain regulatory oversight of the organic agricultural subsector.

17.      Agricultural MIS: M&E, Agricultural Statistics and Agricultural Communications. The
above paragraphs addressing the Agricultural MIS challenges have highlighted the high degree of
strategic relevance of supporting the effective implementation of this SP and the various constraints at the

103
      Note: should focus at the District level, with relevant linkages at the sector, cell, and village levels.

                                                                     144
national and subnational levels involving technical, staffing, and organizational requirements. MINAGRI
has taken steps to initiate the formulation of an action plan for enhancing an MIS for the agriculture
sector, building on the experience/lessons of implementing MINAGRI’s M&E framework of 2011 and
the recently updated M&E framework (June 2014). These improvements are expected to include the
following elements:
    i. A well-aligned and harmonized M&E framework (including the evaluation framework of PSTA 3)
       with PSTA 3’s RF (using the recently prepared “core” RF as a reference point);
   ii. Operationalized in a sound and phased manner to ensure the data collection systems, processes, and
       institutional roles at national and subnational levels focus on generating realistic, reliable, and
       timely data on the key results and their “SMART” indicators at the impact, outcome , and output
       levels;
  iii. Ensuring organizational and coordination improvements to better integrate the agricultural M&E
       systems at national and subnational levels, with a focus on the main indicators outlined in the RF
       and evaluation framework of PSTA 3 (e.g., continue the monthly planning and M&E meetings
       convened by the DG of Planning, the active role of the recently established MIS working group,
       supported by appropriate follow-up activities);
  iv. Supported by adequately qualified and experienced technical MIS staff at the national and
       subnational levels (e.g., increase the M&E staff of MINAGRI’s Department of Planning to better
       coordinate and consolidate diverse M&E systems spread among several entities; promote the
       posting of a M&E officer at the District level (currently being promoted by MINALOC as part of
       the decentralization strategy), who can devote increased attention to coordinating and integrating
       M&E activities with MINAGRI’s enhanced M&E framework;
   v. Ensuring that M&E activities devote adequate attention to systematizing relevant experiences and
       good practices that can be scaled up and out as part of PSTA 3’s implementation period and used as
       inputs for the design of PSTA 4; and
  vi. MINAGRI devising and imparting a training program for strengthening the various MIS activities
       outlined above, involving relevant staff at national and subnational levels.

18.     During implementation of the proposed operation, the PforR will need to support MINAGRI’s
efforts to prepare and implement a plan to address the relevant MIS capacity development gaps
highlighted above (which should be supported through a well-formulated PAP and coordinated with other
DPs).

19.     Gender and youth in agriculture. The Agricultural Gender Strategy, together with its capacity-
building strategy, plan, and budgetary aspects, should ensure that all gender-sensitive activities/TA are
incorporated at the operational level at national and subnational levels (MINAGRI).

20.      Environmental mainstreaming in agriculture. Environmental considerations in rural
infrastructure, especially rural roads. See market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest action plan issues
which cover environmental consideration for rural roads.

21.     Planning for climate change. Although MINAGRI is tasked the lead in climate change matters
in the sector, no clear institutional structure(s) exists for coordination and promotion of climate change
issues. Various stakeholders’ low awareness of climate change issues, particularly the farming
community, is a major challenge that needs to be addressed. To address the capacity, institutional, and
awareness challenges, MINAGRI should consider setting up a climate change unit that will champion,
focus, and coordinate climate change actions in the sector in a more systematic and strategic manner. The
unit should be staffed with personnel with the appropriate skills, which should be upgraded over time.

22.     Nutrition and household vulnerability. Capacity-building plan for local multisectoral teams and
community representatives (SHG leaders) and linkages with other SP areas (e.g., extension, cooperatives,
and health workers (MINAGRI and Ministry of Health, District health officers). The capacity-building
plan should build on current nutrition education and behavior change training provided through health
workers and MINAGRI, as well as more comprehensive training on linkages with nutrition and
agriculture (both quality and quantity aspects), linkages between nutrition and sanitation, and food safety
measures, especially aflatoxin. The capacity-building plan should also focus on improving the quality of
“last miles” services and ensuring that community leaders and health workers have an institutional
platform that enables them to build farmers’ capacity in a cost-effective way.

3.   OVERALL RISK RATING: MODERATE




                                                                                       151
                                    Technical Risk Rating/Assessment

The Bank’s technical team reviewed all PSTA 3 SPs. Based on the technical assessment findings,
the Bank team provided a technical risk rating with relevant justification and relevant risk
mitigation and improvement measures for each SP (also reflected in Annex 4) as input to the PforR
operation’s integrated risk assessment and PAP. Below are the results of the detailed risk review.

Program1: Agriculture and animal resource intensification

1.      Soil Conservation and Land Husbandry. Overall risk rating: Moderate. Shortfalls in funding
and delayed funding releases (from Treasury) for infrastructure development. Lack of proper maintenance
of erosion control infrastructure and soil fertility management leading to aging of top soils and yield
reduction. Lack of regular soil testing facilities and services to calibrate recommendations which can lead
to inappropriate and inefficient blanket recommendations. Lack of capacity at the District level to
properly coordinate and implement these programs, and weak farmers’ organizations and cooperatives to
mobilize farmers effectively, especially to provide the required ongoing maintenance.

2.       Irrigation and water management. Overall risk rating: Moderate. Limited and high cost of
energy for pressurized irrigation development. Shortfalls in funding and delayed funding releases (by
Treasury) for irrigation infrastructure development. Lack of a good framework for O&M leading to a lot
of challenges for large irrigation schemes. Lack of proper incentives for private sector investments in
irrigation development. Lack of capacity at the District level to properly implement these programs. Weak
Irrigation Water User Organizations, which constrain adequate O&M of irrigation facilities.

3.       Agricultural mechanization. Overall risk rating: Moderate. The major risks in achieving
PSTA 3’s mechanization objectives include: i) lack of capacity in adequate operation and management of
machinery; ii) lack of mechanization specialists; iii) lack of standards and technical specification of
machineries not yet identified; iv) lack of policy related to standards; v) lack of farmers’ financial
capacities to finance mechanization; vi) limited access to finance from the banking system, including high
interest rates; and vii) low engagement of the private sector in agricultural mechanization (i.e., only 20
percent of the mechanization services/powered fleet is owned by the private sector and the rest
undertaken by the GoR). In fact, only seven private companies and importing agents are involved; out of
that, only three companies are operating in tractors and power tillers services delivery. RAB is the current
organization for testing and certification but does not handle agricultural machinery. In any case, there are
no facilities for testing and certification of agricultural machinery. The draft mechanization policy needs
to be finalized and implemented to ensure a clear and sound roadmap for the development of the sector,
especially to expand the role of the private sector, including clear provisions to promote operational
leasing appropriate for hiring of tractors and other farm machinery.

4.       Agrochemical use and markets. Overall risk rating: Moderate. A number of potential risk
areas would have to be mitigated to increase the chances of successfully achieving PSTA 3’s
agrochemical and markets objectives. For instance, there is a lack of monitoring of soil nutrient levels to
inform the specific types of fertilizer to be recommended for use in each commune. Without these site-
specific recommendations, farmers run the risk of paying for nutrients they may not need, thereby
reducing the profitability of using fertilizers. Farmers’ knowledge of the benefits of and how to use the
fertilizers efficiently is not strong enough to stimulate increased use. This is worsened by the typically
high farm-gate fertilizer prices that may be beyond the means of farmers without a subsidy. Also, the
quality of fertilizers on the market needs to be monitored for quality assurance. Although the RBS has
drafted fertilizer specifications (requirements for nutrient content; testing; labeling; packaging), these
have yet to be finalized, published, disseminated to stakeholders, and enforced. The lack of capacity for
quality assurance does not rid the sector of potential faking/adulteration of fertilizers. The issue of private
sector participation in the fertilizer industry is critical for sustainability of the supply chain management.
While increasing, there is presently limited private sector participation in the fertilizer supply chain,

                                                     152
potentially reducing access by farmers to fertilizers at competitive prices. In addition, laws and
regulations of direct consequence for fertilizer marketing, including registration procedures, packaging
and labeling requirements, and quality control measures (e.g., pre-shipment inspection and final retail
inspection and enforcement), are critically inadequate. It is important for the GoR to finalize, approve,
and implement the draft fertilizer policy, which should address the above challenges.

5.        Seed development. Overall risk rating: Moderate. One risk to the achievement of PSTA 3’s
objectives relates to weak institutional arrangements to promote the seeds sector, with an expanded role of
the private sector. Apart from the fact that RAB Seed Program Unit has a weak capacity for seed
certification, it is inappropriate to house the seed inspection and certification unit in RAB, given that these
arrangements pose a potential source of conflict of interest, since RAB also is involved in both seed
production and distribution. For overall coordination of the seed sector development, there needs to be a
National Seed Council, presently lacking in Rwanda. To ensure effective and efficient national seed
varieties are developed and released, Rwanda needs to an active National Variety Evaluation Committee
and a National Variety Release Committee, both of which are not operational. Although the government
is willing to promote private sector investment in the seed sector, only 3 percent of the seeds used in the
country are from the private sector, an indication of weak capacities of private seed producers and traders.
Quality assurance is important, yet RBS (responsible for ensuring quality) is not fully involved in
providing quality assurance for seeds. There is a difficulty in estimating effective demand for production
planning: the current “demand” level is artificial as a result of the subsidy program, and hence estimated
figures are unreliable for planning purposes. There is also a risk that controlling seed releases by the
government may constrain the introduction of valuable seed varieties from other international research
efforts, thereby limiting potential productivity gains at relatively low costs.

6.       Livestock development. The risk rating is considered: Moderate. The main risk relies on the
lack of prioritization of species to be supported, which might lead to scattering of resources and focus on
subsectors with lower potential for growth and competitiveness. Another risk is that the need to respond
to the lack of natural resources and accessibility of animal feed as a major bottleneck to livestock
intensification is not sufficiently addressed in Program 2 to generate and transfer technologies that would
tackle this issue.

Program 2: Research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers

7.      Research, technology transfer and extension services for producers. Overall risk rating:
Low. Most of the research (introduction of enhanced technologies) and extension, crop indicators, and
proposed DLIs can be achieved if institutional changes in RAB and the climate change adaption and
mitigation measures are adopted and implemented.

8.       Farmers’ cooperatives and organizations. Overall risk rating: Moderate. The key risk is that
the benefits arising from farmers’ organizations and cooperatives are captured by a few farmer
households, and the majority of smallholders, including women, do not benefit from these services. The
cooperative model will not be viable or cost-effective if the majority of farmers, especially those in the
bottom 50 percent, do not benefit from their services. Most of the institutional indicators can be achieved
if there is capacity within MINAGRI and the local level to provide necessary facilitation and technical
assistance in forming and strengthening small groups, farmers’ organizations and cooperatives.
Investments in human capacity development – building capacity at the local level (staff and LSPs) as well
as farmer-to-farmer extension are critical for mitigating these risks.




                                                     153
Program 3: Value chain development and private sector investment

9.       Creating an environment to attract private investment, encourage entrepreneurship, and
facilitate market access. Overall risk rating: Moderate Rwanda’s comparative advantage and excellent
growing conditions are proven for each of the four priority PSTA 3 export crops. However, key export
targets and outcome indicators in relation to productivity and production are ambitious and will not be
achieved unless the government succeeds in attracting experienced private investors, including foreign
investors, to help increase production and productivity and in introducing new technologies and improved
market access across all priority value chains. It is vital for MINAGRI to complete, approve, and
implement key policies for seeds, fertilizer and agriculture finance.

10.      Development of priority food crop value chains. The risk rating is considered: Moderate.
Although the set production targets of the priority food crops can be achieved, several critical elements of
the value chain development are weak or lacking. Value chain development will also depend on the
progress made in organizing farmers, provision of business development services, links to the market, and
private sector development and investments.

11.     Development of priority export crop value chains. Overall risk rating: Moderate to
Substantial. In terms of specific value chains, horticulture and pyrethrum targets have a higher risk than
the targets set for tea and coffee. The horticulture targets can almost certainly not be achieved without an
influx of 10-20 experienced international “anchor” investors.

12.      Development of priority dairy and meat value chains. The risk rating is considered:
Moderate to Substantial. The SP’s overall objective of doubling the national consumption of milk and
dairy products within a three-year period seems overambitious. In addition, the overall objective of
intensification and market competitiveness may be contradictory with the One-Cow (Girinka) Program,
where the disbursement of dairy cows across many households might increase production, collection, and
marketing costs.

13.    Development of priority fisheries and apiculture value chains. The risk rating is considered:
Substantial. Although these two value chains have strong potential for growth given the demand and are
important to ensure inclusive growth, the lack of human resources, in both quantity and skills, remains a
major bottleneck for the implementation of these two SPs.

14.      Agricultural Finance. Overall risk rating: Substantial. Some of the major risks to achieving
the targeted outcomes relate to the overall macroeconomic dynamics that affect interest rates, liquidity,
and supply of bank financing in the country. Models for economic analysis of the interventions should
account for scenarios where: i) donor funding decreases over time, thus increasing government
borrowing, crowding out the private sector, and further increasing interest rates; and ii) inadequate access
to international credit due to international financial movements. In addition, more program specific risks
to achieving the Program results include:
    i.   Inadequate analysis of demand and private sector response to the proposed interventions;
   ii.   Misalignment between the Program interventions and the private sector development trajectory;
  iii.   Lack of stakeholder analysis and buy in;
  iv.    Coordination failures, especially in developing nationwide systems such WRSs; and
   v.    In the case of agricultural insurance, the main risk may be the inability for any of the parties
         (GoR or farmer beneficiaries) to finance ex-ante premiums. However, a comparative analysis of
         other emerging countries shows that GoR support in this area is one of the most likely ways to
         achieve the objective of widespread farmer coverage.

15.    Market-oriented infrastructure for post-harvest. Promote efficient and equitable transport
systems. The risk rating is considered: Moderate. The road rehabilitation works in PSTA 3 are
expected to be implemented by Districts, which have limited experience with and capacity for

                                                    154
implementing rural feeder road works. Cost overruns could occur due to unforeseen high-frequency, low
impact geo-hazards, such as landslides caused by hydrological and geological factors. The risk rating
takes into account the delays ongoing transport works are experiencing in Rwanda, in particular the
timely processing of procurement tasks with acceptable quality, as the challenge is expected to be more
profound at the District level. Currently, there is no mechanism for a stable flow of funds for financing
District Class 2/feeder roads and sustainability of the feeder roads network is at risk, without
strengthening of the community-based rural road O&M brigades.

16.     Reduce staple crop post-harvest losses at the producer and first aggregator level. Overall
risk rating: Moderate. RAB currently lacks the capacity to respond to farmers’ needs for post-harvest
technologies and hence needs capacity building. There might be a time lag in getting staff trained to be
able to deliver on the objective of identifying and extending post-harvest technologies to farmers.
Recruiting agricultural engineers and agro-economists to assist in the evaluation of potential technologies
and build commercial strategies may also take time. The availability of funds to secure the services of
these additional staff may also be an issue. Clarifying the roles of the public and private sectors will
be important to ensure that the government does not overinvest and that the private sector does not
underinvest (also linked to sustainable productivity increases and incentives for private sector role).

Program 4: Institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting issues

17.      Institutional capacity building. Overall risk rating: Moderate. Given that there have been
several recent diagnostic assessments of the capacity needs and required priority actions to address
various capacity constraints by the main implementing actors, generally, these reports and ongoing
activities provide a sound basis for identifying and addressing relevant risks regarding adequate capacity
to implement the ASIP and Ag. PforR support operation. In addition, numerous ongoing projects (being
implemented by the SPIUs) provide various types of capacity development of farmers’ cooperatives and
organizations. This would enhance marketing and value chain/enterprise activities especially under
Program 3 of PSTA 3. There does appear to be a gap in capacity development activities of other private
sector actors, especially farmer and private sector advocacy associations (e.g., Chamber of Commerce,
Private Sector Foundation). The enhanced institutionalization of the capacity management aspects as cited
above, in addition to ongoing initiatives that can strengthen diverse private sector actors in value chain
development, will help ensure that moderate risks are effectively managed at various levels and by the
above actors, and on a timely basis.

18.      Decentralization in agriculture. The risk rating is considered: Moderate. The main rationale
of enhanced decentralization is to bring improved agricultural services closer to farmers as the main
clients, together with strengthening delivery and financial accountabilities, thereby reducing the moderate
risks of not providing relevant, efficient, and effective expanded agricultural services. MINAGRI’s recent
progress report on decentralization (April 2014) highlights the following main challenges to achieving the
above SO (see the progress report for further details, including specific recommendations for each
challenge/risk area):
   i.   Progress in continued operational mainstreaming and integrating decentralization aspects of RAB,
        NAEB and the three SPIUs;
  ii.   Progress in strengthening the planning, budgetary, governance, and M&E aspects at the
        subnational level, with respect to implementing the various SPs of PSTA 3 (and linkages with the
        DIP), which is also linked to progress at the overall level; special attention is placed on the
        implementation of the earmarked transfer funds which contribute to the achievement of the
        relevant SP targets implemented primarily at the District/sector levels;
iii.    Progress in carrying out the District-level MTEF, Strategic Issues Paper, Action Plan, and
        performance contract (especially with regards to the agriculture sector);
 iv.    Progress in implementing earmarked funds at the District level;



                                                   155
 v.    Progress in expanding the proportion of “open funds” at the District level (and a decrease in the
       proportion of earmarked funds), and ensuring that District priorities reflect the priorities for
       achieving the targets of PSTA 3, as relevant at the District level; and
vi.    Progress in strengthening various ongoing and proposed mechanisms and processes of enhanced
       decentralization, including: further strengthening efficiencies and effectiveness in decentralization
       of agricultural services – e.g., strengthened capacities of key staffing (especially with respect to
       District agronomists, vets, M&E expert); closing process “gaps” at the District level; strengthening
       relatively weak M&E capacities; carrying out relevant capacity development initiatives; and
       operationalizing the role and effectiveness of the newly appointed MINAGRI focal point staff
       person for agricultural decentralization; and translating and implementing the ASIP investments
       into efficiently implemented operational plans at the District level.

19.     Develop regulations for organic agriculture, pesticide, and limestone use. The risk rating is
considered: Moderate. Although the organic agriculture sector can depend on foreign certification, it
would be efficient and cost-effective to invest in the certification of products locally. Public investment
would be necessary, especially since regulatory responsibility lies with the government. To address the
apparent lack of capacity on the part of the companies to carry out certification, passing the cost of such
capacity building onto the companies is recommended, while MINAGRI maintains the functions of
designing and executing the capacity building with support from NGOs, donors, etc. as appropriate.

20.      Agricultural MIS: M&E, Agricultural Statistics and Agricultural Communications
The risk rating is considered: Moderate. Currently, the agricultural MIS is highly fragmented and
focused on tracking output targets reflected in the annual performance contracts for MINAGRI and each
of the Districts. Achieving this operational reorientation of the MIS, and giving adequate attention to
assessing progress at the impact and outcome levels will require effective and concerted leadership by
MINAGRI management, its two implementing entities (RAB and NAEB), and the Program Coordinators
of the three SPIUs, enabled by an operational action plan (to be formulated and agreed), and by
implementation of a well-focused, short-term training plan to be carried out at national and subnational
levels. These follow-up actions should include relevant support for each of the three components of the
agricultural MIS – M&E, statistics, and communications. In addition, effective coordination with other
key actors outside the direct control of MINAGRI will be vital.

21.      Gender and youth in agriculture. The risk rating is considered: Moderate. There is risk of
exclusion of the most vulnerable women and youth from benefits of various SP areas if adequate thought
is not given up-front to confidence and capacity building of the vulnerable groups and linkages with other
programs. Women-headed households fall in the category of extreme poor and own an average of 0.1 ha
of land. Women provide the bulk of labor in the crop sector but function mainly at subsistence level with
insufficient skills, access to markets, and control over land and other facilities. This group of vulnerable
women would require extra technical and institutional support to help them benefit from various
interventions. As gender equality is cross-cutting, this risk can be addressed by ensuring that all other SP
areas (extension, finance, markets, etc.) focus on inclusion and equity, and address capacity and
information gaps faced by women to access inputs and services. Similarly, there is high risk of excluding
youth if they are not effectively mobilized and counseled and are not participating at the community level
in cooperatives and SHGs. MINAGRI could prepare rural youth, especially most vulnerable ones, for
employment and income generation and opportunities provided through other ministries such as Youth,
ICT, and Commerce.

22.     Environmental mainstreaming in agriculture. Environmental considerations in rural roads.
Risk Rating: Moderate to Substantial. Road works are not designed or executed in a manner fully
consistent with the GoR’s safeguards policies. Where widening of hillside roads and construction of
embankment along marshlands are required, this may involve farmland expropriation. During
construction environmental mitigation, including health and safety measures, may not be mainstreamed in
contracts and implemented. Challenges include: i) dealing with landslides in the hilly areas and

                                                    156
requirements for raising the embankment of roads; and ii) provision of abundant cross drains in the
swampy areas, which do not restrict the natural flow of water.

23.      Planning for climate change. The risk rating is considered: High. Climate change is a major
risk to the sector as over 90 percent of Rwanda’s production is rainfed. Although the policy and plans for
mainstreaming climate change are prepared, there is limited institutional capacity and coordination at the
national level. Furthermore, the capacity and awareness at the District and farmer level are low and need
to be strengthened.

24.     Nutrition and household vulnerability. Overall risk rating: Low. Most of the activities in the
SP area are achievable and have been launched on the ground. There are institutional platforms at the
local and national levels. In term of risks, adequate capacity of linkages at the local level could be
addressed through further improving the skills of the local staff and strengthening technical and
operational linkages with the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education.




                                                   157
                      Annex 10: Detailed Program Implementation Support Plan

1.      While nine of the subprograms (SPs) consume 88 percent of the budget, the remaining 15
SPs are also key to delivering the results, DLIs, and key impacts desires for PSTA 3. Therefore, a
multi-disciplinary set of technical specialists along with fiduciary and environmental and social specialists
will be needed to support the GoR in the overall implementation of the PSTA 3/PforR operation. While
results and DLIs are planned to be assessed as completed annually, a 6-month approach to
implementation support, where a specific one- to two-week implementation support mission would be
carried out, will be employed. In addition, a number of technical specialists are based in the region,
subregion, and country office, which will allow timely follow-up on specific issues and/or areas of
concern if needed.

2.       Thus the Agriculture PforR operation in Rwanda will require considerable well-
coordinated, focused technical support from the Bank team, particularly during the early stages of
implementation. One challenge will be to coordinate the actions agreed in the Program Action Plan
(PAP) with operational activities on the ground, ensuring that information flows effectively and on a
timely basis between policy makers and implementation agents (MINAGRI, RAB, NAEB, SPIUs, and
Districts). While channels of communication are generally good within Rwanda, there will be a continual
flow of information to and between implementing entities during the Program relating to the
implementation of PSTA 3. At the District level, implementation actors will need to confirm that their
planning is timely to ensure that available funding can be absorbed and results delivered in time and
within expected budget envelopes. The team recognizes that the PforR mode of operation, which transfers
performance risk to the implementing agents, provides a challenge, particularly at the local level. The fact
that the World Bank Group’s Ag. PforR program support staff are highly decentralized, with task team
leader and key team members based in Rwanda and Kenya, will facilitate overall implementation and
timely communication with the client and other various stakeholders involved in the implementation
phase.

3.      The focus of Bank implementation support will emphasize making the results-based
incentive system work to its full potential. This will include: i) reviewing implementation progress,
including the PAP and achievement of Program results (of core results of PSTA 3, as reflected in the RF)
and DLIs; ii) providing support on resolving emerging Program implementation issues and bottlenecks
and on building institutional capacity of the key actors; iii) monitoring the adequacy of systems ’
performance, and monitoring compliance with legal agreements; iv) supporting the government in
monitoring and managing changes in the various types of risks; and v) confirming that MINAGRI has
prepared and is implementing the plan to enhance the relevant MIS capacity development gaps identified
in the Technical Assessment.

4.       Key to the Bank’s effective implementation support will be the coordination a nd timing
aligned with critical points in the planning and verification of results for disbursement requests to
the World Bank. The first implementation support mission will take place as soon as possible after
effectiveness to provide direct and timely feedback on the quality of implementation plans (MINAGRI,
RAB, NAEB, and Districts) and their likely soundness and acceptability, as well as assessing initial
results emerging from 2013/14). It is expected that at that stage initial progress will have been made
towards achievement of the first set of results and DLIs and achievement of many of the actions in the
PAP. These will be reviewed during the initial review mission. The first mission is therefore expected to
include all team members (i.e., technical, environmental, social, and fiduciary specialists). Subsequent
implementation support will have a stronger emphasis on verification/M&E skills and technical
implementation expertise, varying according to the actual needs as specified in the PAP.
