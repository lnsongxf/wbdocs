Objective of the Study Tour
The South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) organized a study
tour to the Mississippi River Basin from June 14-18, 2015
as part of its knowledge exchange activities in the Brah-
maputra basin. SAWI is a multi-donor partnership be-
tween the World Bank and the governments of United
Kingdom, Australia and Norway. The initiative is work-
ing to increase regional cooperation in the management
of the major rivers of the Himalaya in South Asia. The
objective of the study tour was to share and learn best
lessons in river basin management, specifically focusing
on flood management, bank erosion, navigation, and in-
tegrated water resource management, and to share best         Dr. Barb Kleiss providing answers to participants
practices within basins.

The participants included senior officials and technical specialists from India, Bangladesh and
Bhutan. The study tour included visits to the Mississippi River Commission, the US Army Corps of
Engineers, Engineers Research and Development Center, Mississippi Levee Board, and the New
Orleans District.

While there was considerable opportunity for participants to gain technical capacity and learn
modern approaches to river basin management, the key learning from the tour was to assess
good practices that could be applied to the Brahmaputra basin. There were also focused techni-
cal discussions with experts on best practices and strategies to address common key challenges
in managing large river basins.


The Basin Stories
The Brahmaputra basin covers 580,000 square kilometer (km2), ranks fifth in the world in terms
of total flow, and yet remains largely undeveloped. The basin spans China (50 percent), India
(34 percent), Bangladesh (8 percent) and Bhutan (8 percent) and is home to more than 130 mil-
lion people. Around 86 percent of the basin population lives in rural areas and earns less than
a few thousand dollars per year.

In the wet season, the basin is prone to major flooding and rapid geomorphological changes
that threaten property and life. In the dry season, low water availability and an uneven spatial
distribution of water causes water stress and competition amongst users. Climate change is ex-
pected to increase evapotranspiration (thus increasing water demand), alter the spatial and tem-
poral distribution of precipitation, increase the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts,
and accelerate glacier melting. This compounds the existing water management challenges in
the basin.

Additionally, in the Meghna Estuary (where the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna rivers meet), sea-
level rise poses serious environmental and social problems. To date, development in the basin

                                                                                                    7
                                                                 Strengthening River Basi n Management
                                                                              in the Brahmaputra Basins




   Participants on a riverboat being given an overview of the history of the
   Mississippi River Commission


has mainly been at national and sub-national levels. The lack of basin-wide planning and
management to guide development, inform policy and increase regional cooperation means
development has been piecemeal and fragmented and has not delivered major contributions to
poverty reduction and economic growth.

The Mississippi is the largest river in the United States and third largest in the world, draining
approximately 41 percent of the country. It extends from the continental divide in the Rocky
Mountains to the Appalachian Mountains, and from just south of the Great Lakes to the Gulf
of Mexico.

Historically, the Mississippi River and its major tributaries were managed mainly for navigation
purposes, as the river provides critical transportation links for commerce. The river forms the
main stem of a network of inland navigable waterways. Even today, river shipping remains the
most economical and efficient mode of transportation for bulk commodities. For the system to
be vital and efficient, it is critical that there is an efficient link between deep-draft ocean-going
vessels and shallow-draft river boats. In order to ensure that the river remained navigable, the
US federal government needed to control perennial floods that characterize the river.

The Mississippi River basin is a good example of how the role of the federal government has
evolved with regards to flood control, and illustrates the different objectives for which it is man-
aged. The US Congress established the Mississippi River Commission (MRC) to use an integrated
basin-wide approach to water resources management.

The similarity of challenges between the two basins and means of tackling these in the Mississippi
River basin offer a valuable opportunity for technical and policy learnings on basin cooperation
in flood management, integrated water resources, and opportunities in navigation. Recently,
the Ministry of Water Resources in India has called for basin-wide planning and engagement of
riparian states in the management of water resources in the Brahmaputra.

In 2014, Bangladesh and the Netherlands agreed to work on the challenges of delta man-
agement in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta. Adaptive delta management has been
highlighted as a key agenda for India and Bangladesh. Given the numerous initiatives under
way on flood and disaster management, and the growing focus in South Asia on understanding
the economic benefits of improved water resources management and the processes to achieve
these, the study tour was especially timely.
                                     Lessons from the Study Tour


The lessons from Mississippi highlighted during
the tour are summarized below.

Successful flood management relies
on robust institutions and policies
Tour participants learned the role that institutions
play in flood management, and about policies
and laws that have empowered them. MRC was
established in 1879 by an act of the Congress
to improve planning and management of the
Mississippi River. Initially, MRC sought to foster
navigation, promote commerce, and prevent                Executive Director of MRC giving an
destructive floods — an extremely difficult and          overview of the institutional arrangements
complex set of engineering problems at the time.
After the flood of 1927, the engineering responsibilities fell on the US Army Corps of Engineers,
while MRC continued to provide water resources engineering direction and policy advice to the
Administration, Congress, and the Army. The mission remains the same as it was in 1879 — to
lead the sustainable management and development of water-related resources for the overall
well-being of the nation and its people.

The government and the US Army Corps of Engineers are mandated by law to inform all residents
in high risk areas of the risks of living near the flood plain. Institutions in the U.S. are robust in
that they have defined their roles and been successful in coordinating activities pre- and post-
floods.

Flood management requires not only structural interventions but softer
measures as well
To deal with flooding, local and national institutions in the U.S. have combined to erect an
extensive flood protection system, to create river flood and hurricane forecasting, and develop
evacuation plans and communications strategies. Participants learnt about the hard and soft
investments in place to effectively control and manage the “design” flood (the high stage assessed
as possible at any location). The size of this flood is not calculated based on historical time series
of flood flows, but rather on the maximum projected stage at a location based on the routing of
a series of back-to-back hypothetical meteorological events.

The Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) project was authorized by Congress as part of the
Flood Control Act of 1928. It had four key elements: (i) levees for containing flood flows; (ii)
floodways for passage of excess flows past critical reaches of the Mississippi River; (iii) channel
improvements and stabilization to provide an efficient and reliable navigation channel; and
(iv) tributary basin improvements for major drainage basins. MR&T is a comprehensive water
resources project for flood damage reduction and navigation improvement on the Mississippi
River. Its elements depend on hard and soft measures and it has been successful in managing

                                                                                                         9
                                                                  Strengthening River Basi n Management
                                                                               in the Brahmaputra Basins




both. Participants learnt that the success in managing the 2011 flood was testament to the fact
that the project was a wise investment for the nation. This is also evidenced it its economic returns,
which have been calculated to be a US$45 for every US$1 invested (USACE calculation).

A suite of decision support tools are required to make informed
decisions and plans at a basin scale
In the Mississippi River basin, water management options are coupled with a number of basin-
wide information and technology systems to improve the effectiveness of flood management.
These systems include: (i) real-time analytical modeling that benefits from extensive monitoring
and physical modeling; (ii) conjunctive management of multiple reservoirs to control water and
sediment; and (iii) a real-time flood control decision support system. Hydraulic and coastal
dynamic processes are modeled at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center
(ERDC). ERDC and its laboratories have extremely high-quality equipment, ranging from the
world’s fastest supercomputers to unique, one-of-a-kind physical models.

The participants visited different laboratories at ERDC including the Coastal and Hydraulics
Laboratory (CHL), and met research hydraulic engineers at the ERDC. CHL focuses on
experimental and computational expertise to address water resource challenges in groundwater,
watersheds, rivers, reservoirs, lakes, estuaries, harbors, coastal inlets, and wetlands.

Many of the tools used at ERDC could be used specifically in the Brahmaputra for flood and
sediment management.

Adaptive management requires resilience and coordination
at all levels at all times
The example of New Orleans is one of adaptive management and resilience to repeated floods
and hurricanes. Resilience enables communities to rebound from disaster and reduce long-term
vulnerability, thus moving toward a more sustainable footing. Creating the elements of community
resilience takes many years. Resilience includes adaptability and learning from experiences in
other disasters, anticipating unexpected problems, and planning for redundancy in emergency
response and recovery. In coping with extreme events from climate change and other hazards,
the New Orleans experience highlighted issues of long-term planning that spanned all three
levels of government: local, state and federal. For resilient communities, in advance of hazard
events, the tri-level system (city, state, federal) of emergency response needs to effectively use,
collaborate with, and coordinate with combined public and private efforts. Integrated water




   Participants at ERDC
resources management and regulation are only possible when different levels of government
work together. Achieving this coordination and community resilience is a long-term process, as
demonstrated by the New Orleans example. But is it highly relevant to the Brahmaputra where
people must adapt to living with floods.

Water resource management requires a multidisciplinary approach
A combinationof engineering, technological, social, economic and legal expertise is needed to
manage a river basin. This requires coordination across departments and administrative regions
from central government down to provincial government levels. A multidisciplinary approach
also allows for: (i) equity and fairness when making difficult choices; (ii) establishment of
democratic negotiation mechanisms to improve coordination and stakeholder engagement; (iii)
optimization of water regulation and storage schemes based on cutting-edge water resources
management and modeling and simulation; and (iv) establishment of a comprehensive water
regulation information monitoring system and emergency response mechanisms. Watershed
management with social and economic incentives is essential for basin-wide management.




                                    Follow-up Activities

A key challenge in many negotiations on water is that the different countries in a basin are geo-
graphically not in the same place and have no forum for discussion. The study tour thus provided
an opportunity for specialists from Bangladesh, Bhutan and India to be in the same place and
jointly discuss and identify areas of collaboration and activities that may be undertaken to bet-
ter manage the water resources of the Brahmaputra basin. Being in the Mississippi basin, the
participants were also inspired to cooperate and develop their shared basin.

As a follow up, participants recommended that a Knowledge Exchange Forum be established
to share knowledge on the Brahmaputra. The forum will operate at a technical level, identifying
best tools and technologies and using these to identify solutions for different challenges in the
basin. It is expected that this forum will foster cooperative data and knowledge sharing for im-
proved river basin management. It will lay the ground work for discussions on data needs, river
basin modeling and policy trade-off assessment. It will identify the core knowledge, institutional
and capacity gaps that exist in the basin.

Other follow-up activities include attending a conference in December 2015 where participants
will learn how different stakeholders in the U.S. river basins negotiate. The World Bank will liaise
between government officials to facilitate this event.

There was unanimous agreement from a follow-up survey that the study tour led to improving
trust between the countries and increased chances of regional cooperation.
