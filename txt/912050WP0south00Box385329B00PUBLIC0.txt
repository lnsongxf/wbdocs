hydropower development further fuelling the debt
buildup. However, the risk of debt distress continues to

debtedness is high in Sri Lanka as well, but the public
debt position improved over 2014H1 to 74.3 percent
of GDP, down from 78.3 percent at the end of 2013.
In India, general government debt registered a minor
decline, from 51.7 percent of GDP in the previous
fiscal year to 50.6 percent in FY2014. Combined with
an only marginal decline in state-level debt, the overall
public debt to GDP ratio is expected to fall slightly,
from 66.9 percent of GDP in the previous fiscal year to
66.4 percent in FY2014. Similarly, Pakistan’s debt ratio
improved to 63.7 percent in FY2013/14, down by only
0.6 percentage points from the previous fiscal year, and
still above the 60 percent limit stipulated in the 2005
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act. Public
debt is much lower in Bangladesh, and it is on a down-
ward trend, from 37.4 percent of GDP in FY2012/13
to 35.5 percent in FY2013/14, and a projected 34.4
percent for FY2014/5. Similarly Nepal’s vulnerability
to debt distress is ranked as low, with debt to GDP at
historic lows of 30.5 percent of GDP (down from 60
percent a decade ago). Maldives public debt defies this
generally encouraging picture. In calendar year 2013 it
reached 86.2 percent of GDP, and it is growing. Lim-
ited sources of financing make Maldives a country at a
high risk of external debt distress.

Some countries have managed to decrease the risk
profile of their public debt portfolios. Pakistan
achieved an important improvement in its debt risk
profile in FY2013/14 by shifting towards the longer
end of the yield curve. An outstanding Rs. 1.2 trillion in
short-maturity treasury bills were retired and replaced
with long-maturity Pakistan Investment Bonds in the
amount of Rs. 1.8 trillion, thereby increasing the share
of medium-to long-term domestic debt and lowering
rollover and refinancing risks. And a healthy flow of
multilateral and bilateral monies followed Pakistan’s

   on-budget from what was previously being undertaken
   directly by donors. Afghanistan has considerable pub-
   lic expenditure needs in security, service delivery, es-
   sential infrastructure, and operations and maintenance.
   Prioritizing these expenditure needs within the limited
   resource envelope will be critical to maintaining a pro-
   development stance. In light of mandatory security
   spending, a more aggressive expenditure consolidation
   path would directly squeeze essential civilian operating
   and development spending. The resulting financing
   needs of the budget are, therefore, likely to remain
   substantial for the foreseeable future. Donors have

   on three main areas: (i) establishing fiscal stability;

   commitment to tackle corruption and strengthen gov-

more revenues kick in from projects and new taxa-
tion measures, despite the upward revision of public
compensation.

Aggregate demand will regain momentum in the next
12 months. Consumption will rebound following the
lift of administrative measures to curb imports and the
raise in civil service salaries in July 2014, while invest-
ment will be sustained with continued inflows into the
hydropower sector. Private consumption contributes
around two-thirds of total consumption, while private
investment, boosted by hydropower, is more than 75
percent of GDP. In addition, a liquidity injection in
the financial institutions and establishment of cottage,
small and medium industries as a part of the economic
stimulus package is expected to reinvigorate growth
especially in the manufacturing and service sectors (see
previous issues of the World Bank Bhutan economic
update).

The service industry is expected to pick up again dur-
ing the second half of 2014, driven by strong tourism
and relaxation of credit restrictions in the financial
sector. The World Bank estimates that hotel, restau-
rants and trade/retail will grow at 15 percent in 2014.

The outlook is positive but macroeconomic pressures
on domestic demand will need close management.
GDP growth should reach 7.3 percent in FY15/16 due
largely to ongoing construction of four hydropower
projects, the commissioning of the Dagachhu project
by mid-2014, Dungsam Cement coming on line, the
possible lift of the bans on imports and housing credit,
disbursements from India for the 11th Five-Year Plan
(2013-2018) which will lead to higher public capital
spending, the economic stimulus plan, increased public
wages expected in the FY14/15 budget, and innovative
tourism promotions. This activity could bring over-
heating and macro imbalances; it will be important to
tighten monetary and fiscal policies.

The financial sector remains adequately capital-
ized, with a capital adequacy ratio 18.20 percent in
March 2014, above the institutional requirement. Yet
vulnerabilities arise from asset-liability mismatches,

Outlook and Policy
GDP growth is projected to rise to 4.5 percent in
2014 with likely improved performance by construc-
tion and the transport industry compensating for
the slowdown of tourism. Inflation is likely to remain
moderate due to stable international prices.

The immediate macroeconomic challenges for Mal-
dives are the fiscal and external imbalances driven
by high and rising public spending that lead to high
debt, limited fiscal space and depleted reserves, and
an undiversified economy, primarily dependent on
tourism and fisheries. The path towards fiscal and
debt sustainability will require short-term measures to
address the current cash crunch, as well as long-term
structural measures that are important but will entail
political and social costs. An array of measures could
be combined in a policy package accompanied with a
communication strategy to sensitize the public on the
need to adopt and implement these reforms.

   (ii) The evolution of remittance growth. Given the
   phenomenal growth of remittances in past years and
   the fact that over 4 million Nepali are already working
   overseas it is difficult to imagine remittance continuing
   to increase significantly year after year. Nevertheless,
   the number of would-be migrants is increasing: gov-
   ernment data indicates some 530,000 Nepali obtained
   permission to work abroad in FY14, compared to
   454,000 in FY13, a significant increase.

   In any case it appears unlikely that the government’s
   target of 6 percent growth will be reached. With the
   agricultural sector expected to slow to 3.7 percent in
   FY15 (based on an expected sector output decline of 20
   percent) and industrial sector growth likely to remain at
   2.7 percent, the services sector would need to expand at
   8.4 percent, a feat that has not been achieved in the past
   decade (the past eight years have averaged 5.5 percent).
   Likewise, if services sector growth maintained the
   good performance of FY14 (6.2 percent), the industrial
   sector would have to expand by 10.5 percent, which is
   even more unlikely (the average of the past 8 years is
   2.9 percent) even if public capital spending increases
   substantially.

   The government has articulated a clear economic
   policy vision, but consistent implementation will be
   key. The broad vision outlined in the Budget speech
   needs to be distilled into concrete, implementable, and
   time-bound plans. This implies significant technical
   background work as well as resolute efforts at prioriti-
   zation. Also, the decision making process remains slow
   and haphazard and must be streamlined so that key
   policies can be implemented with speed and certainty.
   Reforms on paper are good starting point, but if the
   government cannot implement them, it would only be
   déja vu of wasted time and broken promises.

   Risks to the outlook from the international envi-
   ronment appear moderate, based on the apparent
   recovery of advanced economies. Nevertheless, Sri
   Lanka has other risks to watch out for. As the advanced
   economies taper down their extraordinary stimulus
   measures with recovery, global interest rates will likely
   rise and lead to a tightening of financial conditions
   across the world. Although the improved growth out-
   look of advanced economies should increase demand
   for emerging market products, such as garments from
   Sri Lanka, it could also have negative spill-overs. At
   the same time, there are signs of slowdown in emerging
   markets after their pre-crisis highs. Given the signifi-
   cant and rising contribution of the emerging markets
   to the global economy, a slowdown could have negative
   effects on global growth through reductions in trade,
   finance, and commodity market channels. Political ten-
   sions in Ukraine, and the Middle East could also spill
   over to other parts of the world in the form of disrup-
   tions to production or transportation of natural gas and
   crude oil; although commodity prices are expected to
   remain benign.
