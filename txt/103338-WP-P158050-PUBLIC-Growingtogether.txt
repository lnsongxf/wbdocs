GROWING TOGETHER
 Reducing rural poverty
     in Myanmar

Policies that enable rural communities to participate in expanding economic opportunities can be central to
inclusive growth in Myanmar. Rural communities are home to the majority of Myanmar’s population, the majority
of its many ethnic groups, and 70 percent of its poor. Development in rural areas is constrained by low returns to
agriculture, and significantly lower levels of public service delivery and human development outcomes relative to
urban areas.

Reforms to enhance agriculture productivity are necessary though not sufficient for improving the welfare and
livelihoods of rural communities. These have to be complemented with increased access to social and economic
services that can raise human and physical capacity to create the conditions necessary for the growth of a dynamic
rural non-farm sector. These reforms could help to not only reduce the drag on rural growth and poverty reduction,
but also contribute to structural economic transformation so that the welfare of all people in Myanmar can grow
together.




 Context and opportunities for change

Poverty is prevalent throughout Myanmar’s rural             Fig 1: Paddy yields, selected countries in Asia, 2014-2015
areas; the majority of the poor earn their incomes
from agricultural activities and casual work. More
than half of Myanmar’s labor force works in agriculture,
but the country has yet to experience the agricultural
revolution needed to raise living standards and to sup-
port a structural shift towards higher-value manufac-
turing and services. Agriculture accounted for around
31 percent of GDP in 2014, but the sector suffers from
low productivity. The average yield of the dominant
crop, paddy, is amongst the lowest in Asia (Figure 1).
In addition, one hectare of monsoon season rice from
the Delta region in Myanmar generates on average US$
140 of profits (defined as revenues less all production
costs, including family labor), compared to US$ 340 in
Cambodia and US$ 430 in Vietnam.

security over customary lands in the upland areas, the significant
reasons for conflicts. The security of event individual plots
with land user right certificates is also weak due to the lack of
information data bases and infrastructure to properly reflect
actual land use situation.

To help implement these and promote rural invest-            Figure 4: Poverty and expenditures per capita by States and

to States and Regions. State and Region spending as
a share of overall public sector expenditure is relatively
low at around 10 percent, but their expenditure assign-
ments cover important economic services (e.g. agri-
culture, local transport and communications, cottage
industry, small scale energy projects), which are critical
to rural development. Some of the States and Regions
with higher levels of poverty also spend more on a per
capita basis (figure 4), which could be a reflection of
efforts to expand services in areas with the biggest
gaps in access to services.

There have been preliminary efforts to develop a formula-
based system of fiscal transfers, which should help to
redistribute fiscal resources according to development
needs. The level of general purpose transfers has            Source: Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey, Ministry

2.3 percent in the 2014-2015 Union Budget. This level
increase has been linked to development conditions           Figure 5: Poverty and Own Current Revenues Per Capita
across States and Regions. This helps to offset fiscal
capacity constraints for some poorer States and
Regions, which also have relatively lower tax payments
per capita (figure 5).

To complement these efforts, Myanmar launched a
national community-driven development program
(NCDDP) in 2013, which is showing early positive
results in reducing poverty in rural areas. The NCDDP
supports communities to formulate development plans
and transfers grants for community-level infrastructure
directly to village tract committees, elected by secret
ballot with gender parity. This program is being rolled
out in an initial set of 27 rural townships across the
country. So far, some 700,000 people have gained             Source: Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey,

the program. Over two thirds of households in project
communities participating in planning, decision-making
and implementation of subprojects, and 75 percent of
community members, have reported high or very high
satisfaction levels with project implementation and
results.

These were complemented by targeted and pro-poor

social services, such as education and health, and
significant investments in rural infrastructure such as
roads, irrigation and electricity. Vietnam also has an
impressive record in keeping rural-urban and regional
disparities in check through central transfers aimed
at poorer areas. Vietnam faced similar challenges
to Myanmar in terms of high poverty among specific
socio-economic groups (especially ethnic minorities)
concentrated in particular geographic locations. The
government in Vietnam has used targeted programs,
which have significantly improved the welfare of ethnic
minorities, who nonetheless still account for over 50
percent of Vietnam’s poor today and around 15 percent
of the total population.
