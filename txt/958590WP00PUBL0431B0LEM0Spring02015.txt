4 | Executive Summary
               lebanon economic monitor | The Economy Of New Drivers and Old Drags



Our analysis finds the following notable results: (i)
the war seems to have affected neither merchandise
nor services exports at the aggregate level; (ii) while
Lebanese exporters to Syria have suffered from a
drop in demand in the Syrian market, other Lebanese
exporters have started to export to Syria to fill the
gap in Syrian production; and (ii) Syrian refugees
in Lebanon provide important impetus to Lebanese
services exports.

VIII. 	 Inefficiencies in power generation impose
sizable macroeconomic costs on Lebanon (Special
Focus). The Lebanese electricity sector has been
underperforming for decades with considerable
socio-economic costs. The macroeconomic impact
has been massive; accruing debt on investments in
and transfers to Electricité du Liban’s (EdL) amounts
to 40 percent of Lebanon’s gross public debt, while
transfers have accounted for over half of the fiscal
deficit. Going forward, transfers to EdL will be
significantly lower on current oil prices. Some of the
measures needed to improve EdL’s financial situation
are well known, such as increased investment,
tariff reforms and corporatization of EdL. Political
and confessional obstacles, however, have so far
hindered any progress.

IX. 	 Water-supply shortages in the region’s
most water-rich country (Special Focus). Despite
the relative availability of water resources, the
Lebanese suffer from serious shortages of water
supply. Moreover, the cost of inaction in the water
sector is estimated at about 1.8 percent of GDP or
2.8 percent of GDP if the cost of environmental
degradation is included. The Government must
urgently address priorities within the sector.

analyse détaillée des données a débouché sur les
principaux résultats suivants: (i) la guerre semble ne
pas avoir affecté ni l’exportation des marchandises,
ni celle des services au niveau global; (ii) alors que
les exportateurs libanais en Syrie ont souffert d’une
baisse de la demande sur le marché syrien, d’autres
exportateurs libanais ont commencé à exporter vers
la Syrie pour combler certaines lacunes au niveau
de la production syrienne; et (ii) les réfugiés syriens
au Liban ont donné une impulsion importante aux
exportations de services libanais.

viii.	L’inefficacité du secteur de l’électricité
impose       des      coûts     macro-économiques
considérables au Liban (Focus spécial). Le secteur
libanais de l’électricité est sous-performant depuis
des décennies avec des coûts socio-économiques
considérables. L’impact macro-économique a été
massif; par exemple les transferts cumulés de l’Etat
à l’EdL ainsi que leur financement représentent 40
pour cent de la dette publique brute du Liban, tandis
que les transferts représentent depuis plusieurs
années autour de la moitié du déficit budgétaire
annuel. Pour l’avenir proche,  les transferts à l’EdL
seront sensiblement plus faibles compte tenu
des prix actuels du pétrole. Certaines mesures
nécessaires pour améliorer la situation financière de
l’EdL sont bien connues, telles que l’augmentation
des investissements, les réformes tarifaires et de
la corporisation de la companie. Les obstacles
politiques et confessionnels, ont cependant entravé
jusqu’à présent tout progrès.

                        BOX 1. Syria-Related Economic Activity in Lebanon: What the Data Does Not Tell


    Amid a systemic weakness in the statistical system in Lebanon, measuring the economic impact and contribution
    of Syrian nationals on the economy is challenging but likely underestimated. The Syrian conflict and in particular
    the massive influx of refugees into Lebanon is likely leading to a structural break in the measurement of economic
    transactions. Economic activity with Syria and of Syrian nationals in Lebanon is likely under-reported in traditional
    data both on the production and expenditure sides of national accounts. Several factors could account for this
    under-estimation. For example, with the growth of the war economy in Syria, trading with neighboring countries is
    likely becoming more informal; similarly Syrian firms in Lebanon are, to a significant extent, also likely to operate
    informally due to their smaller size and being inhibited by registration rules that are less favorable to foreigners. On
    the consumer side, Syrian consumers are likely to have their final consumption subject to a much lower effective
    tax rate than the average Lebanese (or traditional tourist) consumer given their lower income level which tilts their
    consumption towards staple goods (mostly VAT exempt) or towards goods that do not or only partially enter the VAT
    net (subsistence food, purchase from small retailers that are below the VAT registration threshold).

    The main interest rates that matter in this arrangement
are the international dollar rate, a local rate on dollar deposits
and a local rate on LBP deposits. A spread between the local
and international dollar rates attracts deposits in dollar, while a
spread between LBP and local dollar rates encourages deposits
in local currency. Nonetheless, like much of the country,
Lebanon’s banking system is highly dollarized (65.5 percent
dollarization rate).

a deposit growth rate of about 8 percent would cover the
economy’s financing needs while keeping reserves high.

    For example, in 2011 the US accused the Lebanese Canadian
Bank of money laundry, which caused a rattle in the Lebanese
financial sector. BdL immediately declared that it has sufficient
funds to back up the bank, rapidly negotiated a takeover by
Societe Generale de Banque au Liban, and eventually agreed on
a settlement with the US government.

Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index).
While, the rise in demand from the Syrian refugees
has exacerbated these problems, a deficit in service
delivery pre-existed the influx. Hence, any reform
and/or investment in those areas will go towards
alleviating this pre-exiting deficit, once the refugees
return to their homes (World Bank et al., 2013). In
the meantime, while refugees are present, the much
needed reforms would go a long way in improving
living conditions and standards of both Lebanese
and refugee communities, mitigating tensions
among communities. In the short-term, given the
protracted impact that the Syrian conflict has had
and is projected to continue having for some time
on the Lebanese economy, the option of delaying
further any policy decision and action is ultimately
hurting the economy and its citizens as growth
remains weak, debt is again accumulating rapidly,
jobs are not created, corruption becomes even more
prevalent, and services deteriorate at an accelerating
pace. Policy inaction is not just putting on hold
Lebanon’s development, it is dragging it backwards.

quintile. The impact on the poor and less well-off
consumers, would, however, need to be carefully
assessed and compensated if needed.

71.	     Private sector participation in the
distribution network should be sustained in order
to harness efficiency gains and quality of service
delivery. The on-going contracts of 3 distribution
service providers (DSP) should be implemented
successfully. The objective of these contracts is
improving management of electricity distribution
and retail, as well as improving billing and collection
of electricity. Issues with respect to EdL staffing, and
recent labor strikes have affected the implementation
of these contracts, also impacting EdL revenues.
Cohesive Government action is required in order
to resolve EdL labor issues in accordance with
international best practice for utility management.

72.	    The corporatization of EdL remains
important in order to increase its efficiency. At the
request of the government, the World Bank provided
support to the development of a roadmap leading
to corporatization. This roadmap aimed at making
proposals in the two following areas: 1) Industry
structure— number of companies, ownership,
management and other key ‘macro-organizational’
issues; and 2) Industry model and instruments (how
would the unbundled sector function, where would
markets be introduced, which segments would be
regulated, and additional ‘process-related’ issues
designed to improve the overall sector efficiency).
Even though this roadmap was finalized in 2012
and a cross-ministerial committee was established
to oversee the planning, not enough consensus has
been built in the Government for this critical reform
to be implemented.

 The Ministry of Energy and Water is responsible for strategic planning of water resources management, including the

 strategies for water monitoring and distribution. Until the development of the National Water Sector Strategy in
 2012, an overall water resources master plan or strategy for development of water storage did not exist.
 MoEW struggles with lagging capacity in water resources planning, allocation and regulation. The regulation of
 groundwater abstraction, including the issue of permits for well drilling, is currently not enforced, with a large

                                                      Recent Findings


  Recent research into the outcomes of irrigation projects globally finds that performance has been underwhelming,
  with physical infrastructure deteriorating quickly, agricultural productivity growth stalling, and modern irrigation
  technology not relieving as much stress on water resources as initially anticipated. The causes of underperformance
  are complex but some common themes have emerged:
  •	 Although irrigation systems have the potential to conserve water, they should not be relied upon to do so. This
      is because the goal of irrigation systems is to enable plants to transpire more water, which is beneficial because
      there is an almost one-to-one correlation between transpiration and yield. Irrigation systems are successful
      because they increase plant water consumption by allowing higher rates of transpiration, in turn allowing
      farmers to grow either more of the same plant or more water-intensive plants. Holding all else constant, the end
      result should be an increase in agricultural productivity (World Bank, “Going Beyond Agricultural Productivity”,
      December 2014).
  •	 Investments in irrigation infrastructure should be undertaken with a plan for sustainable financing. Irrigation
      schemes require on-going operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures. Failure to implement adequate
      O&M regimes leads to premature depreciation of the infrastructure, resulting in a build-neglect-rebuild cycle.
      Irrigation investments are often undertaken with the expectation that O&M activities will be financed through
      cost recovery with central governments providing the bulk of upfront capital costs. Responsibility for O&M is
      subsequently transferred to decentralized authorities expected to recover the on-going costs of O&M through
      tariffs or other user fees. While this is an equitable idea—those who benefit from a service also pay for it—
      the global experience implementing cost recovery regimes has been largely unsuccessful. Even in the best of
      circumstances—i.e. places with high-functioning governments and productive agricultural systems—it is not
      clear that full cost recovery has been achieved.
  •	 Investment in social and human capital is just as, if not more important, than investment in physical infrastructure.
      Social capital includes laws and policies, pricing structure of tariffs, access to financial and agricultural markets.
      Human capital refers to the capacity of individual farmers to conduct agricultural activities, including education,
      training and expertise to grow the right crops in the right places at the right times etc.

     The Water Supply Augmentation Project (“the Bisri” project) is a national infrastructure project of critical importance. Financed
     by the World Bank, Islamic Development Bank and Lebanese Government, the project involves the construction of the second
     largest water supply dam in Lebanon, a series of upstream wastewater treatment infrastructure and 2 hydropower plants among
     other components. This infrastructure will connect to infrastructure currently under implementation under the Greater Beirut
     Water Supply Project, thereby drastically increasing the volume of water available to the Greater Beirut Mount Lebanon region,
     where over 2.2 million people live, many of whom are poor. The project also places priority focus on the institutional reforms
     and capacity strengthening of the Beirut and Mount Lebanon (BML) WE and its partners, for the long term sustainable delivery of
     adequate water services to the beneficiary population. This includes monitoring of groundwater reserves, balancing demands for

Fall 2013 LEM: The
Brunt of the Syrian
Conflict
Lebanon: Economic and Social Impact of the
Syrian Conflict: (Special Focus) During the 2012-
2014 period, the conflict in Syria is having a large,
negative, and rapidly growing impact on Lebanon’s
economy, its social fabric, and its public services.
On the economic front, the deteriorating security
situation is undermining consumption, investment
which is dragging down growth. The cumulative
losses in economic activity could reach an estimated
USD7.5 billion. On the social front, social cohesion
is rapidly deteriorating partly due to combination of
rising poverty— approximately 170,000 Lebanese
would be pushed into poverty (over and above the
1 million currently living below the poverty line)—a
worsening labor market which is estimated to result
in a doubling of the unemployment rate to above
20 percent, rising insecurity, amid deteriorating core
public services. Public services are under pressure
given the sudden and large increase in their demand
arising from the Syrian refugee influx. The fiscal cost
of Syrian conflict is estimated at USD2.6 billion,
of which USD1.5 billion stems from foregone
government revenue collection while the remaining
USD1.1 billion are expenditure incurred by the
