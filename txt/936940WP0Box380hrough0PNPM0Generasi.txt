John Victor Bottini and Andi Yoga Tama at TNP2K/PRSF, and Dewi Sudharta at
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) were instrumental in
getting this study off the ground.

Prior to fieldwork, key inputs for the planning of this study came from Yulia Herawati,
Sadwanto Purnomo, Gerda Gulo, Robert Wrobel, Jon Jellema, Ana-Maria Arriagada,
Peter Agnew, Karrie McLaughlin, and especially Rebekah Pinto.

PNPM Generasi actors at district, sub-district, and village levels facilitated and
welcomed the authors during their field research. The authors thank District Facilitators
Bapak Nasirul (Sukabumi, West Java), Bapak Christo Adisma (East Manggarai, East
Nusa Tenggara), and Bapak Iskandar Munir (Pamekasan, East Java), as well as the
anonymous sub-district and village facilitators in “Ciperi,” “Bonde,” and “Pandeyan”
sub-districts where the authors did their study. Local puskesmas staff, posyandu
volunteers, traditional birth attendants, formal and informal village leaders, and
ordinary young mothers and fathers in these communities graciously endured hours
of interviews and observation.

During writing and revision, this report benefitted from peer review and presentation
feedback, especially from Robert Wrobel, Rebekah Pinto, Ancila Irwan, Patrick
Hermanus, Widya Setyowati, Sadwanto Purnomo, Gerda Gulo, Peter Agnew, Lily Hoo
and Audrey Sacks. Two supporting researchers, Nelti Anggraini and Siti Ruhanawati,
brought creative initiative and analysis to this project during fieldwork and later
provided routine feedback and cross-checks on the data long after their formal time
commitments to the study had ended. Their contributions thoroughly saturate this
report.

Editorial and typesetting assistance for this report was provided by the PSF
Communication Team.

Financial support for the overall PNPM Generasi program and the evaluation series

Ringkasan Eksekutif


  Latar Belakang:            Pemerintah Indonesia memandang PNPM Generasi sebagai salah satu
                             instrumen pembiayaan pembangunan berbasis pengguna layanan yang
                             dapat mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi masyarakat. PNPM Generasi
                             membantu mengurangi jumlah balita pendek (stunting) dan memperbaiki
                             gejala malnutrisi kronis lainnya di wilayah perdesaan Indonesia. Pernyataan
                             ini sebagian dilakukan berdasarkan hasil evaluasi dampak yang menunjukkan
                             bahwa PNPM Generasi mampu menekan jumlah penderita gizi buruk.
                             Namun demikian, temuan evaluasi tersebut tidak menjelaskan pendekatan
                             (“bagaimana” dan “kenapa”) PNPM Generasi mampu mengatasi malnutrisi
                             kronis terutama pada konteks sistem kesehatan yang menekankan pada
                             deteksi dan penanganan malnutrisi akut namun tidak mendorong terciptanya
                             perilaku sehat yang dibutuhkan untuk memperbaiki tingkat nutrisi ibu dan
                             anak dalam jangka panjang.


                             Penelitian “Peluang dan Strategi untuk mencapai Tingkat Nutrisi yang Lebih
                             Baik dalam PNPM Generasi” (Opportunities and Approaches for Better
                             Nutrition Outcomes in PNPM Generasi) dilakukan untuk mengidentifikasi
                             dan mendokumentasikan kontribusi PNPM Generasi terhadap Pemerintah
                             Indonesia yang berupaya untuk mengurangi jumlah penderita malnutrisi
                             kronis di seluruh nusantara. Hal ini penting karena mulai tahun 2014 kegiatan
                             PNPM Generasi berfokus pada perbaikan gizi ibu dan anak terutama pada
                             penderita malnutrisi kronis.



  Pertanyaan                 Tiga pertanyaan (RQ) akan dibahas pada kajian ini. Secara singkat,
  Penelitian                 pertanyaan-pertanyaan berikut berkaitan dengan upaya-upaya yang
  (Research                  dilakukan PNPM Generasi untuk mendorong interaksi sosial dengan
  Questions -                masyarakat (dan sebaliknya) dalam rangka memperbaiki tingkat gizi ibu dan
  RQ):                       anak terutama pada penderita malnutrisi kronis.




  RQ 1                               RQ 2                                RQ 3
  Bagaimana indikator malnutrisi     Sejauh mana dana hibah bersyarat    Sejauh mana kegiatan PNPM
  kronis membaik atau memburuk       kinerja yang disalurkan PNPM        Generasi mempengaruhi para
  di desa-desa penerima PNPM         Generasi dapat mempengaruhi         kader kesehatan setempat,
  Generasi?                          perilaku masyarakat terkait         pemimpin desa, penyedia layanan,
                                     perbaikan gizi dan mendorong        dan pengguna layanan? (Sebagai
                                     respon kolektif dalam menangani     contoh: kesadaran masyarakat

Metode          Selama sebulan penuh tiga peneliti kualitatif mengadakan wawancara semi
Penelitian      terstruktur (semi-structured interviews), diskusi kelompok terarah informal
dan             (informal focus group discussions), dan observasi etnografis di satu desa lokasi
Pemilihan
Lokasi:         pre test di Jawa Barat, dua desa di Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), dan dua desa
                di Jawa Timur. Pemilihan lokasi ditentukan untuk melakukan perbandingan
                berdasarkan wilayah dan pencapaian indikator nutrisi yaitu membandingkan
                sebuah kabupaten di NTT yang memiliki pencapaian rata-rata dengan
                kabupaten di Jawa Timur yang memiliki pencapaian dengan peningkatan
                paling tinggi selama beberapa tahun terakhir. Setiap kecamatan di tiap
                kabupaten dan dua desa di tiap kecamatan dipilih untuk kajian mendalam
                (in-depth study). Pemilihan ini dilakukan berdasarkan pendekatan kualitatif
                murni dan pengamatan di lapangan. Lama kajian adalah sekitar dua minggu
                untuk setiap kecamatan. Dua desa di setiap kecamatan dipilih berdasarkan
                desa mana yang memiliki pencapaian nutrisi terbaik dan rata-rata. Daftar
                pertanyaan lebih rinci dan topik diskusi secara garis besar terkait gizi ibu dan
                anak disajikan pada lampiran 2. Tabel 1 dan 2 menunjukkan karakteristik desa-
                desa yang terpilih dalam kajian ini.
Hasil Temuan:



RQ 1            Kaitan dengan Indikator Nurtrisi yang Membaik atau Memburuk (RQ1)


                1.1. Pengadaan dan pendistribusian Pemberian Makanan Tambahan (PMT)
                yang dilakukan PNPM Generasi tidak berkaitan dengan perbaikan gizi.


                1.2. Seorang bidan yang aktif dan berdedikasi, dan tinggal di desa dimana ia
                bertugas penuh waktu serta memperlakukan masyarakat dengan rasa hormat
                dan kesabaran cenderung dapat:


                            •	   Memastikan ibu kurang gizi dan anak-anaknya tidak keluar
                                 dari batas aman jaringan pengamanan sosial (social safety
                                 net).
                            •	   Lebih aktif mengelola dan mengawasi kegiatan posyandu
                                 dengan terus memberikan dukungan dan pendidikan bagi
                                 kader yang bekerja untuknya.
                            •	   Dapat memfasilitasi koordinasi antara PNPM Generasi dan
                                 Puskesmas.
                            •	   Membantu terbentuknya legitimasi kegiatan kesehatan PNPM
                                 Generasi di desa.




                                          06
       1.3. Partisipasi kepemimpinan masyarakat yang strategis di posyandu dan
       kegiatan kesehatan ibu dan anak lainnya secara tidak langsung mendorong
       penguna dan permintaan terhadap pelayanan masyarakat.


       1.4. Elite control dan elite capture, tidak hanya terkait dengan penyalahgunaan
       material dan keuangan secara strategis, namun juga pada penyebaran
       informasi dan pengetahuan yang dapat melemahkan upaya masyarakat dan
       keluarga untuk memperbaiki taraf kesehatan mereka.


       1.5. Pemahaman lokal mengenai siapa yang lebih layak mendapatkan
       pelayanan kesehatan ibu dan anak dapat berakibat pada munculnya perbedaan
       akses terhadap pelayanan dan penjangkauan.


       1.6. Pola makan yang monoton dan konsumsi makanan rendah protein
       berhubungan dengan gizi rendah yang dialami oleh ibu dan anak.


       1.7. Perilaku masyarakat dan keluarga dalam menjaga kebersihan berakibat
       langsung terhadap kesehatan ibu dan anak termasuk kesehatan gizi.




RQ 2
       Efektivitas Pemberian Dana Hibah dengan Insentif (general incentivized
       block grants RQ2)


       2.1. Para pemimpin desa (formal maupun informal), penduduk desa, dan
       bahkan pelaku PNPM Generasi di desa-desa menunjukkan pemahaman yang
       terbatas mengenai penyaluran dana hibah dengan insentif.




RQ 3
       Dampak PNPM Generasi terhadap kader dan Penyedia Layanan Kesehatan
       (RQ3)


       3.1 Salah satu kesuksesan terbesar PNPM Generasi adalah revitalisasi posyandu
       desa, termasuk dukungan PNPM Generasi terhadap kader posyandu.


       3.2. PNPM Generasi memberikan alat kepada masyarakat untuk dapat
       membayangkan pelayanan kesehatan yang mereka harapkan.


       3.3. Ketika seorang bidan desa hadir dan aktif bekerja dalam masyarakat
       penerima program PNPM Generasi, maka akan terbuka kesempatan untuk
       menjalin kerjasama yang saling menguntungkan antara layanan kesehatan
       dan PNPM Generasi.


       3.4. Ketika seorang bidan desa tidak hadir dan aktif bekerja dalam masyarakat
       penerima program PNPM Generasi, maka akan terjadi berbagai miskomunikasi
       dan salah pemahaman terhadap kegiatan PNPM Generasi. Hal ini berujung



                                07
               pada munculnya rasa tidak suka atau bahkan membuat para penyedia
               layanan kesehatan mengundurkan diri dari pekerjaannya.


               3.5. PNPM Generasi tidak memiliki dampak langsung terhadap
               pemahaman dan praktik dukun anak (TBA) di desa-desa penerima
               program PNPM Generasi. Namun kajian ini menemukan bahwa
               banyak ibu terutama kaum ibu yang terpinggirkan secara ekonomi dan
               sosial (social margins) atau tinggal jauh dari klinik masih menggunakan
               jasa dukun anak pada masa sebelum dan setelah melahirkan. PNPM
               Generasi sebaiknya melihat dukun anak sebagai sumber daya yang
               belum tersentuh yang dapat diberdayakan untuk kegiatan pendidikan
               dan advokasi ibu di masa depan.



Rekomendasi:   PNPM Generasi menghabiskan sebagian besar anggarannya untuk
               pengadaan makanan tambahan. Namun demikian, hasil yang didapat
               tidak sepadan dengan biaya yang dikeluarkan. Berikut adalah
Pemberian
Makanan        rekomendasi untuk membatasi dan memodifikasi alokasi yang tidak
Tambahan       proporsional tersebut:
(PMT):             •	 Membatasi alokasi dana PNPM Generasi untuk PMT.
                   •	 Memperbaiki kualitas makanan tambahan dengan meminta
                       PNPM Generasi agar membeli bahan makanan segar dari
                       petani lokal daripada membeli dari kota/menggunakan
                       makanan pabrikan.
                   •	 Merancang mekanisme yang transparan yang memungkinkan
                       untuk dampat membeli PMT dari petani lokal namun tetap
                       sesuai dengan ketentuan akuntabilitas dan audit PNPM
                       Generasi.
                   •	 Merancang sebuah mekanisme yang fleksibel untuk
                       penanganan cepat dan tepat sasaran terhadap kasus malnutrisi
                       akut yang teridentifikasi dengan PMT pemulihan.



Posyandu:      Posyandu tetap berfungsi sebagai institusi desa yang berpotensi besar.
               Namun demikian, para peneliti menemukan berbagai pelaksanaan yang
               tidak konsisten. PNPM Generasi dapat meningkatkan dukungannya
               terhadap posyandu melalui berbagai cara berikut:
                   •	 Meningkatkan insentif bagi kader sesuai dengan hasil kerja
                       yang dapat dipertanggungjawabkan.
                   •	 Melatih dan memberdayakan kader sehingga mereka dapat
                       mengidentifikasi tanda-tanda gizi buruk, infeksi, resiko
                       kehamilan, dan bahkan gangguan kesehatan jiwa sebagai
                       catatan rujukan untuk diberikan kepada tenaga terlatih dan
                       profesional.


                                 08
                        •	   Melatih dan menugaskan kader untuk mengukur panjang bayi dan
                             tinggi balita. Rekomendasi ini kemungkinan akan membutuhkan
                             modifikasi indikator kesehatan PNPM Generasi sehingga dapat
                             menyesuaikan dengan pertumbuhan anak berbadan pendek
                             (stunting).
                        •	   Meningkatkan fungsi posyandu sebagai ujung tombak pemberi
                             layanan kesehatan ibu dan anak sehingga dapat lebih efektif
                             menjangkau para orangtua setiap bulannya.
                        •	   Memberikan advokasi dan memberdayakan perkumpulan
                             (associations) masyarakat untuk memastikan mereka turut
                             bertanggungjawab atas penyaluran pemberian makanan tambahan
                             (PMT) penyuluhan di Posyandu serta insentif lain seperti kegiatan
                             arisan yang dapat meningkatkan partisipasi masyarakat.



Dukun beranak        PNPM Generasi sebaiknya tidak mengabaikan peran dan potensi dukun
(traditional birth   beranak di desa-desa. Menurut pedoman kementerian kesehatan, dukun
attendants –         beranak dapat mendukung kinerja bidan. Mereka dapat turut mendidik
TBAs):               dan memberdayakan para ibu terkait masalah kesehatan ibu dan anak.
                     Berikut adalah beberapa rekomendasi untuk PNPM Generasi:
                         •	 Menyertakan dukun beranak dalam kegiatan pelatihan yang
                             diadakan PNPM Generasi bagi kader posyandu.
                         •	 Mengembangkan dan memberikan advokasi bagi terciptanya
                             kerjasama yang bersifat adil antara bidan dan dukun beranak.
                             Kerjasama ini hendaknya dilakukan berdasarkan pedoman nasional
                             kementerian kesehatan.
                         •	 Dilarang keras mendorong terciptanya kerjasama yang menerapkan
                             taktik menakutkan dan hukuman yang dapat memperkuat stigma
                             dan mengucilkan dukun beranak. Dukun beranak telah bertahan
                             sebagai institusi desa di hampir seluruh perdesaan di Indonesia.



Advokasi:               •	   Hindari menggandakan (doubling) atau mengganti kegiatan
                             pelatihan yang berada di bawah kegiatan puskesmas. Lebih
                             baik melakukan advokasi dan mendukung puskesmas dalam
                             mengadakan kegiatannya secara penuh bagi semua pihak yang
                             berkepentingan.
                        •	   Alihkan kegiatan PMT PNPM Generasi menjadi kegiatan yang
                             dapat membantu puskesmas dalam pengajuan dan penerimaan
                             anggaran PMT Posyandu dari dinas kesehatan kabupaten serta
                             membantu puskesmas untuk dapat mengelola anggaran tersebut
                             secara benar.




                                           09
•	   Mempertimbangkan untuk memperkerjakan fasilitator di level
     kabupaten atau propinsi dengan kualifikasi yang diakui di bidang
     kesehatan untuk mengadakan kegiatan advokasi yang meyakinkan
     dengan penyedia layanan kesehatan.
•	   Dorong para pelaku PNPM Generasi untuk belajar dan
     mengevaluasi resiko dan gejala malnutrisi serta untuk memahami
     alat yang digunakan PNPM Generasi untuk mengatasi permasalahan
     malnutrisi masyarakat.
•	   Fasilitator kecamatan dan kabupaten sebaiknya lebih sering
     melakukan kegiatan yang menjangkau masyarakat (outreach
     activities) di desa-desa secara terbuka dan menginformasikan para
     keluarga mengenai kebijakan kesehatan dan layanan yang mereka
     butuhkan.
•	   Menjangkau masyarakat pria terutama kaum ayah.
•	   Mengidentifikasi dan mendukung para pemimpin formal maupun
     informal di desa-desa penerima program PNPM Generasi yang
     berpotensi menjadi juru bicara kesehatan ibu dan anak bagi
     masyarakat.
•	   menjajaki kemungkinan untuk mengalihkan pekerjaan advokasi
     kepada organisasi masyarakat lokal terkait dengan masalah
     kesehatan dan tata kelola.

Executive Summary


                 Background:        The Government of Indonesia has identified PNPM Generasi
                                    as one of several demand-side financing instruments through
                                    which to reduce stunting and improve other indicators of chronic
                                    malnutrition in rural Indonesia. This decision was based partly on
                                    impact evaluation findings that show Generasi reduced malnutrition,
                                    but the findings did not shed light on the approaches (“how” and
                                    “why”) through which Generasi might specifically address chronic
                                    malnutrition, especially in the context of a health system that
                                    emphasizes the detection and treatment of acute malnutrition,
                                    but does not promote or incentivize healthy behaviors needed to
                                    improve long-term maternal and child nutrition. The “Opportunities
                                    and Approaches for Better Nutrition Outcomes in PNPM Generasi”
                                    research was commissioned to identify and document ways in which
                                    PNPM Generasi might contribute to the Indonesian government’s
                                    efforts to reduce chronic malnutrition throughout the archipelago.
                                    This is especially critical given Generasi’s overall shift toward
                                    maternal and child nutrition, with a growing emphasis on chronic
                                    malnutrition, beginning in 2014.




                 Research           Three research questions (RQ) guided this study. In short, these
                 Questions:         questions ask how Generasi’s efforts facilitate community-based
                                    social interactions (and vice versa) to improve nutritional outcomes
                                    among mothers and their young children, with particular attention
                                    paid to chronic undernutrition:




  RQ 1                              RQ 2                               RQ 3

  How do chronic malnutrition       To what extent do Generasi’s       To what extent have local health
  indicators improve or worsen in   incentivized block grants          volunteers, village leaders,
  Generasi villages?                precipitate community actions      service providers, and service

                                    and collective responses to        to Generasi activities? (e.g.
                                    treating cases of underweight or   raise awareness of particular
                                    malnutrition?                      health issues, and incentivize

                                                                       utilization?)

Methods      Three qualitative researchers spent one month conducting semi-
and Site     structured interviews, informal focus group discussions, and
Selection:   ethnographic observations in one pilot study village in West Java, two
             villages in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), and two villages in East Java.
             Site selection aimed for comparison by region and nutrition indicator
             outcomes, comparing an average performing district in NTT with the
             most improved district in East Java during the past few years. Using a
             purely qualitative and investigative approach in the field, a sub-district
             in each district and then two villages in each sub-district, were selected
             for in-depth study, with roughly two weeks spent in each sub-district.
             The two villages in each sub-district were selected based on which
             village had the best and average nutritional outcomes. A detailed list
             of questions and discussion topics broadly related to maternal and
             child nutrition is provided in Appendix 2. Tables 1 & 2 report summary
             characteristics of the selected villages.
Findings:



RQ 1         Associations With Improved or Worsened Nutrition Indicators (RQ1)

             1.1 Generasi’s current system of food supplement procurement and
             distribution does not appear to be associated with improved nutritional
             outcomes.

             1.2 An active and engaged midwife that lives in her assigned village
             full time and treats her clients with dignity and patience is more likely
             to:

               •	    ensure that undernourished women and their children do not
                     slip through the social safety net.

               •	    more actively manage and supervise posyandu activities with
                     ongoing support and education for her volunteers.

               •	    facilitate coordination between Generasi and the sub-district
                     puskesmas clinic.

               •	    lend legitimacy to Generasi health activities in the village.

             1.3 Strategic community leadership participation in posyandu and
             other maternal and child health outreach activities and services
             indirectly encourages (or softly compels) wider community service
             utilization and demand.



                                12
            1.4 Elite control and elite capture refer to more than just the strategic
            manipulation of material and monetary resources, but also of information
            and knowledge, which may disempower community and household efforts
            to improve health outcomes.

            1.5 Local conceptions of who is more or less deserving of maternal and child
            health services lead to differential access to care and outreach.

            1.6 Monotonous, protein-poor diets are associated with poor nutritional
            health among mothers and their children.

            1.7 Public and household hygiene practices have direct consequences upon
            maternal and child health, including nutritional health.
Findings:



RQ 2
            Effectiveness of General Incentivized Block Grants (RQ2)

            2.1 In the villages, formal and informal leaders, ordinary residents, and
            even some Generasi actors themselves showed limited understanding of the
            incentivized block grants.
Findings:




RQ 3
            Generasi’s Effect on Health Volunteers and Health Service Providers (RQ3)

            3.1 One of Generasi’s biggest successes has been the revitalization of village
            posyandu, and this includes Generasi’s support for the posyandu volunteers.

            3.2 Generasi provides communities with the tools to imagine alternative
            possibilities of what health services might provide that contrast with the
            status quo.

            3.3 When a village midwife is present and active in Generasi communities,
            there are opportunities for mutually beneficial collaborations between health
            services and Generasi.

            3.4 When a village midwife is not present and active in Generasi communities,
            there are opportunities for miscommunication and misunderstanding
            of Generasi’s activities, leading to resentment or even abdication of
            responsibilities among health service providers.

            3.5 Generasi has no direct effect on the knowledge and practices of
            traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in Generasi villages, but the findings from
            this study show that many mothers, especially at the social margins or at
            great distances from clinics are still using TBA services throughout the entire
            pre- and post-natal childbearing cycle. Generasi should view TBAs as an
            untapped human resource for future education and advocacy activities with
            mothers.

                                     13
Recommendations   Generasi spends most of its health-related expenses on food
                  supplements, but their impact is not commensurate with their expense.
                  The following recommendations suggest ways to limit and modify this
Food
Supplements:      disproportionate allocation of Generasi’s budget:

                    •	    Put limits on Generasi’s budget allocations for food
                          supplements.

                    •	    Improve the quality of food supplements by requiring
                          Generasi to purchase from local vendors of fresh food instead
                          of packaged products from the cities.

                    •	    Devise a transparent mechanism that enables purchase of food
                          supplements from local farming communities but also meets
                          Generasi’s accountability and audit requirements.

                    •	    Devise a more flexible mechanism for rapid and targeted
                          treatment of identified cases of acute malnutrition with food
                          supplements.




Posyandu:         The posyandu remains a village-level institution with great potential,
                  but researchers observed inconsistent variations in its implementation.
                  Generasi could increase its support for posyandu in the following ways:

                    •	    Increase volunteer incentives in exchange for performance
                          accountability.

                    •	    Train and empower volunteers to identify signs of undernutrition,
                          infections, pregnancy risks, and even mental health disorders
                          for referral to trained health professionals.

                    •	    Train and require volunteers to measure the lengths of infants
                          and the heights of toddlers and young children under five.
                          This recommendation may require modifying the Generasi
                          health indicators to include stunting.

                    •	    Leverage posyandu as a front-line maternal and child health
                          service to provide more effective monthly outreach to parents.

                    •	    Advocate for and empower neighborhood associations to
                          assume responsibility for their own posyandu outreach food
                          supplements and other incentives such as arisan activities to
                          improve participation.




                                    14
Traditional   Generasi should not overlook the role and untapped potential of
Birth         the TBAs in the villages. According to Ministry of Health guidelines,
Attendants    TBAs should complement the technical medical skills of midwives
(TBAs):
              by educating and empowering mothers on maternal and child
              health issues. Some recommendations for Generasi to consider:

                •	    Include TBAs in all training activities that Generasi supports
                      for posyandu volunteers.

                •	    Develop and advocate for more inclusive and equitable
                      midwife-TBA partnership agreements based on Ministry of
                      Health national guidelines.

                •	    Strictly avoid supporting partnership agreements that
                      employ scare tactics and punitive approaches that
                      stigmatize and marginalize TBAs, who endure as a village
                      institution across nearly all of rural Indonesia.




Advocacy:       •	    Avoid doubling or replacing training activities that fall under
                      the puskesmas’ purview and instead advocate and support
                      the puskesmas to conduct these activities in full and for all
                      intended stakeholders.

                •	    Transition away from providing outreach food supplements
                      at the posyandu and instead assist the puskesmas to demand
                      and receive a budget for posyandu food supplements from
                      the district health office (and correctly administer it).

                •	    Consider hiring district and/or provincial level facilitators
                      with recognized health credentials to conduct more
                      convincing advocacy work with health service providers.

                •	    Require Generasi actors to learn and appraise the risks
                      and symptoms of malnutrition, and understand the tools
                      Generasi may use to address it in their communities.




                             15
•	   Sub-district and district facilitators should more explicitly
     conduct outreach activities in the villages to inform families
     about health policies and services that meet their needs.

•	   Conduct active family health outreach to men in the villages,
     particularly fathers.

•	   Identify and support the formal and informal leaders in
     Generasi villages who show potential to become maternal
     and child health “spokespersons” in their communities.

•	   Explore outsourcing advocacy work to local civil society
     organizations concerned with health and governance
     issues.

Introduction and Background




  In 2007 the Government of Indonesia introduced PNPM
  Generasi Sehat dan Cerdas (PNPM Healthy and Smart
  Generation—PNPM Generasi) as one of two large-scale pilot
  projects aimed at stimulating demand for and improving
  access for poor, rural communities to basic health and
  education services. PNPM Generasi utilizes incentivized block
  grants and trained PNPM facilitators to assist communities to
  plan and implement activities that address 12 target health
  and education indicators linked to Millennium Development
  Goals to improve maternal and child health, ensure universal
  access to primary education, and reduce poverty.




                           PNPM Generasi was accompanied by a rigorous impact evaluation
                           to test program impacts on health and education outcomes, as well
                           as the differential impacts of a model which provided block grants
                           to villages based on the number of pregnant women and school-
                           aged children (in “Treatment B” sub-districts) against a model
                           which provided performance bonuses to communities based on
                           the relative achievement of the 12 target indicators (in “Treatment
                           A” sub-districts). The evaluation found that overall the program
                           reduced childhood malnutrition, and increased community uptake
                           of a range of services offered at village health posts. The evaluation
                           also found that the incentivized model improved performance on
                           health. In 2010, the government decided to scale up PNPM Generasi
                           in locations with low baseline health and education performance.

                           The PNPM Support Facility (PSF) is working with Government
                           stakeholders, including the PNPM Generasi Implementing Agency,
                           the Directorate General for Community and Village Empowerment
                           (PMD), Ministry of Home Affairs; the National Planning Agency



                                          17
(Bappenas); the Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare (Menkokesra); and the
Vice President’s Office for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) to develop
a medium-term strategy for PNPM Generasi expansion. The strategy will outline a
critical path to expand PNPM Generasi coverage to at least 500 rural sub-districts
with poor health and education performance by 2014, increasing to as many as 800
sub-districts in subsequent years.

The strategy is also intended to incorporate design changes needed to improve
program efficacy, including revisions to community-level target indicators required
to ensure PNPM Generasi supports new Government priorities1 and is responsive to
evolving community demands. Government priorities relevant to PNPM Generasi
include reducing the prevalence of stunting from the 2010 level of 42% in rural areas,
increasing rural sanitation coverage from the 2010 level of 38%, and achieving 86%
enrollment in early childhood education and development (ECED) services by 2025.
Work is underway with the Ministry of Health (MoH), Bappenas, the World Bank
Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) team, and AusAID to introduce incentives
for communities through PNPM Generasi to utilize local nutrition counseling services,
deemed necessary by MoH to improve behaviors that contribute to reductions in
chronic malnutrition levels. This work, which is part of the MCC-supported Community-
based Health and Nutrition to Reduce Stunting program, is also intended to promote
healthy sanitation behaviors. In addition, the Government’s PNPM Mandiri Roadmap
identifies the integrated planning, delivery, and oversight of local poverty reduction
programs as a central focus of its community empowerment poverty reduction cluster.
The Road Map also includes an objective of utilizing PNPM community-based poverty
targeting mechanisms to improve targeting outcomes of its household based poverty
reduction programs.

The Government of Indonesia has identified PNPM Generasi as one of several
demand-side financing instruments through which to reduce stunting and improve
other indicators of chronic malnutrition in rural Indonesia. This decision was based
partly on impact evaluation findings that show Generasi reduced malnutrition, but
the findings did not shed light on the approaches (“how” and “why”) through which
Generasi might specifically address chronic malnutrition, especially in the context of
a health system that emphasizes the detection and treatment of acute malnutrition,
but does not promote or incentivize healthy behaviors needed to improve long-term
maternal and child nutrition. The “Opportunities and Approaches for Better Nutrition
Outcomes in PNPM Generasi” research was commissioned in order to identify
and document ways in which PNPM Generasi might contribute to the Indonesian
government’s efforts to reduce chronic malnutrition throughout the archipelago. This
is especially critical given Generasi’s overall shift toward maternal and child nutrition,
with a growing emphasis on chronic malnutrition, beginning in 2014.

Research Questions

The following overarching research questions (hereafter referenced
as RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3) guided the qualitative field research:




                                                                            RQ 3


                                                        To what extent have local health
                                                        volunteers, village leaders, service
                 RQ1                                    providers, and service users behaved
                                                        differently due to Generasi activities?
    How do chronic                                      (e.g. raise awareness of particular health issues,
                                                        and incentivize communities to improve service
    undernutrition indicators                           utilization?)
    improve or worsen in
    Generasi villages?
                                              RQ 2

                               To what extent do Generasi’s
                               incentivized block grants precipitate
                               community actions that affect
                               nutrition behaviors and collective
                               responses to treating cases of
                               underweight or malnutrition?




In short, these questions ask how Generasi’s efforts facilitate
community-based social interactions (and vice versa) to improve
nutritional outcomes among mothers and their young children,
with particular attention paid to chronic undernutrition. Appendix
2 includes a detailed list of research questions that guided the
interviews during the fieldwork.

Methods

The field research relied upon qualitative research methods to focus on identifying
domains and approaches Generasi might explore to improve nutritional outcomes.
Methods include:




01                           02                               03


Semi-structured              Informal focus group              Ethnographic
interviews                   discussions (FGD)                 observations and
                                                               descriptions




The semi-structured interviews and FGDs were based on question/discussion guides
covering a range of social and behavioral subjects related to maternal and child nutrition
(see Appendix 2). Observations included detailed descriptions of interviews and
discussions, and of sites visited, including government offices, health facilities, village
geography, public resources, and respondent households. Whenever possible, the
research team sought and prioritized participant-observation opportunities at village
posyandu, the monthly integrated maternal and child health service posts staffed by
village health volunteers and supervised by the village midwife and puskesmas (sub-
district public health clinic) staff.

All interviews, FGDs, and descriptive observations were documented with
comprehensive and organized field notes. Interview and FGD field notes address
the questions listed in Appendix 2 tailored to each respondent. The interviewers’




                                  20
analytical evaluations of the interview content and setting (household
descriptions, interview dynamics, etc.) appear at the bottom of
each interview or FGD report. Regional profiles summarize the
districts, sub-districts, and villages that the researchers visited.
When permissible, the lead researcher documented most interview
settings and field observations with a digital camera. Appendix
1 provides a chronological list of all interviews and discussions
conducted throughout the duration of the fieldwork.

Site selection aimed for comparison by region and nutrition indicator
outcomes, with a focus on the provinces sampled in the Generasi
impact evaluation. The research team relied upon the PNPM
Generasi MIS database to select districts based on their nutrition
indicators through 2011, comparing average performing districts
with the most improved district during the past few years. The
district of Sukabumi in West Java province was chosen for the pilot
phase due to its proximity to Jakarta and average nutrition indicators.
For an average performing district, East Manggarai district on the
island of Flores in NTT province was selected. Pamekasan district
on the island of Madura in East Java province was selected for its
most improved nutritional outcomes. For selecting sub-districts
and villages, the research team relied upon a purely qualitative and
investigative approach in the field, speaking with as many district-
level stakeholders as possible in order to determine the locations
that most closely fit the desired selection criteria. With only two
weeks to visit each district, the research team focused on one sub-
district in each district, an average performing sub-district in East
Manggarai, and a most-improved sub-district in Pamekasan. Two
villages under the purview of a single puskesmas (public clinic) in
each sub-district were selected for in depth field research, one with
the best available nutritional outcomes and the other with average
outcomes.

               The largest and most diverse along the urban-rural continuum among the three
               districts sampled in the Generasi nutrition research, Sukabumi occupies 3,934km2 of
               the southwest corner of West Java, which also makes it the largest district (by area)
               in the province (see Map 1 below). Out of Sukabumi’s 47 sub-districts, 22 of them
               currently participate in the PNPM Generasi program, and according to Generasi’s 2012
               annual report, 63% of the Generasi budget is allocated to health activities. Because
               the research team visited Sukabumi as part of the pilot phase of the field research,
               the researchers spent only three nights there, which only allowed a quick visit to one
               village in one sub-district. According to West Java’s Department of Health, Sukabumi
               district reported the highest absolute number of maternal and children-under-five
               mortality cases in 2012 (76, or 9.4% of all maternal deaths, and 521, or 10.3% of all
               children-under-five deaths in West Java), though this in part reflects Sukabumi’s large
               size and population.2

Ciperi         The research team visited the rapidly urbanizing sub-district of Ciperi, and village
Sub-district   of the same name. Ciperi may be growing so fast because it has relatively easy
& Village,     access to markets in Bogor and Jakarta to the north. The research team chose
Sukabumi       to visit Ciperi during the pilot phase for several reasons. First, Generasi’s district
(pilot)        facilitator for Sukabumi used to be the sub-district facilitator in Ciperi, so he could
               help researchers navigate the finer details of this community more rapidly. Second,
               Ciperi would be the research team’s only opportunity to visit a sub-district that is
               currently undergoing a rapid rural-to-urban transition, with 16 factories in Ciperi,
               most of which opened within the last five years. The transition has resulted in an
               increase of migrants from other parts of West Java to work in these factories, though
               most of the factory workers are sourced from the young women originally from Ciperi.
               These women leave their children at home with their grandparents to supervise them.
               One of the factories is a well-known bottled mineral water company; the extraction
               of spring water increasingly depletes the supply of natural clean water for Ciperi’s
               residents. Unregulated factory pollution and boarding house construction for the
               migrants to Ciperi are also on the rise, posing new environmental health hazards.
               The third reason why the research team chose to visit Ciperi is related to the second,
               which is the shocking figure that five out of the six maternal mortality cases in Ciperi
               in 2012 were among young factory workers. Fourth, the sub-district has initiated new
               nutritional awareness programs that the researchers wanted to directly observe. In
               Ciperi village, the research team met a potent mix of community leaders, posyandu
               volunteers, traditional birth attendants, health service refusers due to religious
               reasons, as well as the aforementioned factory workers, which all combined to make
               Ciperi a fascinating, if brief, fieldwork site.

                The mountainous East Manggarai district straddles the mid-section of the western
                half of Flores island in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) province (see Map 2 below).
                East Manggarai is a young district, having recently been established in mid-2007,
                breaking away from Manggarai district to the west. The PNPM Generasi district
                facilitator (FasKab) still manages both Manggarai and East Manggarai in his
                portfolio. As district government facilities and infrastructure in East Manggarai’s
                new district seat of Borong are still under development on the south coast, the
                research team resided in the Manggarai district seat of Ruteng up in the mountains,
                which offered easier access to our selected sub-district of Bonde in the interior.
                The majority of East Manggarai’s population of just over 250,000 people depend
                on farming their own gardens, sometimes at a great walking distance from their
                home village, typically growing commodities such as coffee and cacao instead
                of vegetables for home consumption or local markets. The vast majority of East
                Manggarai’s population is Catholic, though local church leaders do not appear to
                take an active or influential role in local governance. Since 2012, East Manggarai
                has formally joined the rest of NTT province in implementing the Maternal and
                Child Health Revolution (known as Revolusi KIA) program,3 a program discussed in
                more detail in the “Thematic Findings” section below.




Bonde           According to the PNPM Generasi sub-district facilitator (FK) for Bonde, as of 2012
Sub-district,   there were 53,508 residents in Bonde living in 42 villages. Volcanic activity in the
East            region keeps the hills fertile and supports a dense population. It takes three hours
Manggarai       to travel from the seat of Bonde’s sub-district government facilities to the farthest
                village, 2.5 hours on decent roads to the district capital of Borong, and a half hour
                to reach the former district capital of Ruteng in neighboring Manggarai district.
                Bonde has two puskesmas clinics, and the two villages included in this research
                both fall under the purview of one of them, Puskesmas Bonde. This puskesmas
                refers health emergencies to the hospital in Ruteng. The Generasi program has
                been active in Bonde since 2010, but with 42 villages to monitor, the FK has
                an enormous workload and can not give proper attention to the needs of each
                community under his surveillance.

Dantena Village,   From Puskesmas Bonde, it takes forty minutes along a treacherous
Bonde, East        mountainside road with partial and narrow pavement to reach the
Manggarai:         Dantena village head’s office, elementary school, and village clinic,
                   all located around a soccer field clearing in Hamlet 1 (see Image 6).
                   Dantena’s more isolated Hamlet 2 requires an additional half hour walk
                   down a recently stone-paved path (financed by PNPM Rural). There
                   are 1,027 residents living in 255 households in Dantena, nearly all
                   farming coffee and cacao. The village clinic was recently built in 2010,
                   and Dantena has two full time health workers—one nurse and one
                   midwife—assigned to work and live there, but the clinic remains empty,
                   staffed only by its nurse who commutes from Ruteng on weekday
                   mornings. Dantena’s village midwife lives near Puskesmas Bonde.
                   Dantena’s women and children face significant undernutrition, though
                   it does not stand out in Puskesmas Bonde’s records, nor does their
                   frequent reliance upon traditional birth attendants (dukun, hereafter
                   TBA). Each hamlet hosts their own monthly posyandu. The research
                   team selected Dantena for these reasons, but also because of a recent
                   maternal mortality case in which neither health officials nor Dantena
                   neighbors even knew that the deceased woman was pregnant. For
                   more about Dantena’s midwife and how Dantena manages in the
                   absence of nearby health professionals, see Case Study #1.

Bena Village,   Bena has a formal status as kelurahan instead of desa, a distinction that
Bonde, East     marks Bena as more urban and with a standardized governing structure.
Manggarai:      Bena hosts the Bonde sub-district administration and Puskesmas
                Bonde. Bena is larger (2,716 residents living in 720 households) than
                Dantena, and has well-paved roads into all five of its hamlets, but it
                would be a misnomer to call it urban. As with Dantena, most residents
                in Bena are farmers, though Bena does have more civil servants living
                there. The research team chose Bena because of its excellent progress
                in achieving PNPM Generasi’s performance indicators as well as in the
                data reported by Puskesmas Bonde.

                Located just off the north coast of East Java province, road access from Surabaya
                to Madura island via the new Suramadu Bridge was only inaugurated in 2009 in
                hopes of stimulating the economy and reducing out-migration from Madura to
                Java and other parts of the archipelago. Madura is divided into four administrative
                districts that each cross the width of the island from north to south, and whose
                administrative centers are all located along the south shore facing Java. The
                Suramadu Bridge reaches Madura at its west end, and Pamekasan is the third
                district heading eastward (see Map 3 below), with a population of 881,662 living
                across 792km2, which makes Pamekasan the most densely populated district
                that the Generasi nutrition researchers visited. Pamekasan town in the south
                has recently become famous for its vibrant and colorful batik, and researchers
                encountered dozens of rural households engaged in batik home industry during
                the fieldwork. Pamekasan has a more diversified economy than East Manggarai,
                though local prosperity and health indicators decrease as one travels from south to
                north. Like many other districts in East Java, and in contrast with East Manggarai,
                religious leaders (Muslim kyai) play an enormously influential role behind the scenes
                in local governance and in health practices too. More immediately apparent to the
                research team was the outsize role played by village leadership in determining the
                success or failure of village programs such as PNPM. The Generasi program was
                introduced in Pamekasan in 2007 and currently operates in eight of the thirteen
                total sub-districts. Pamekasan was chosen for its tremendous improvement in
                PNPM Generasi’s health indictors reported in the MIS database. Although one
                might conclude that this is an exemplary and hoped-for side effect of the improved
                access afforded by the Suramadu Bridge, researchers encountered additional,
                more proximate causes that certainly contributed to Pamekasan’s significant
                improvement in health service delivery over the past few years.




Pandeyan        It takes a half hour along a wide and well-paved road to travel northward from
Sub-district,   Pamekasan town to the central market area of Pandeyan sub-district, where the
Pamekasan       puskesmas is located next door to a complex of sub-district government offices,
                including the PNPM office. The puskesmas has in-patient care facilities, and a
                complete staff including a full-time nutrition specialist who did her thesis research
                in Pandeyan. On the three separate days that the research team visited this
                puskesmas, the entire facility was bustling with both staff and patients. According
                to the head of the puskesmas, Pandeyan had the highest maternal and infant
                mortality rates in all of East Java, but after implementing an enforced “partnership
                agreement” between TBAs and midwives, there were impressive improvements
                (see Table 2). Although the puskesmas head attributes these improvements almost
                exclusively to the new rules and roles for TBAs in Pandeyan, the researchers came
                across a wide range of efforts across the health sector and PNPM Generasi that
                have also surely contributed to these favorable outcomes.

             The FK for Pandeyan has a more manageable workload supervising 12 villages
             compared to Bonde’s 42 villages, but Pandeyan’s total population of 67,045 exceeds
             Bonde’s by more than 13,000. There are 83 active posyandu across these 12 villages,
             each with a complete staff of five trained volunteers, and this is due largely to inputs
             from Generasi.



Badran       The rocky landscape in Badran is not conducive to routine farming activities; many of
Village,     the men work in a nearby quarry. The research team chose Badran as an exemplary
Pandeyan,    “average” village relative to the impressive achievements in the neighboring village
Pamekasan:   of Suruan. Instead, the researchers encountered a village still recovering from the
             disruptive aftershocks of a very close village election three years prior. Given the
             precarious political situation that prevailed in Badran, the supposed “average”
             nutritional health outcomes are nothing less than astonishing given so much adversity,
             with the former leaders working actively to spoil and sabotage the efforts of the new
             leadership, including their efforts to improve maternal and child health. After the
             election, the entire corps of posyandu volunteers (with one exception), and all of the
             PNPM actors (both Generasi and PNPM Rural) in Badran resigned. Not unlike the
             former leadership, the new regime installed close confidantes and family members
             in these vacant positions to restaff the posyandu and Generasi teams, but with an
             important distinction: nearly all sources interviewed agreed that the new leadership
             is invested in transparent village development that benefits the entire community
             and not just themselves. Just one example: even though Generasi pre-dated the
             new village leadership, there were only five posyandu for seven hamlets before
             the election, each with only a few volunteers, but now there are seven fully staffed
             and trained posyandu, one for each hamlet. Case Study #3 examines the details of
             Generasi’s role in this community going through this painful but productive transition.

Suruan       The agricultural village of Suruan grows tobacco, peanuts, soybeans, and rice. The
Village,     most compelling reason for including Pandeyan in the research were the examples
Pandeyan,    that the Pandeyan FK shared with the team referring repeatedly to the active
Pamekasan:   midwife based in Suruan village (see Case Study #1). The Pandeyan puskesmas
             head confirmed the FK’s reports, and suggested we visit Suruan. And yet, according
             to official puskesmas data, Suruan never achieves its projected health targets.
             Projected targets are based on population statistics, but Suruan’s population, by
             some formal records but not others, includes the population of roughly 5,000 santri
             students that reside in one of Madura’s largest pesantren (Islamic boarding school),
             which leads to skewed estimates such as projected childbirths. While including
             the santri in Suruan’s population data has detrimental effects on projections in the
             health sector, in other sectors of Suruan’s governance, the santri are a political
             benefit, providing a full sack (kantong) of votes for the candidate of their kyai’s
             choosing in any election. Whoever the kyai backs for a village election will surely
             win, providing a strong measure of stability in Suruan’s village politics, and in turn
             enabling the sustained implementation of long-term village development programs
             such as Generasi without significant local friction. While researchers heard stories
             of kyai in other parts of Madura who sought political gain by opposing public health
             programs, in Suruan the powerful kyai has not bothered himself with the health
             sector and village health matters are thus primarily managed by the village midwife
             and secondarily by Generasi actors.

Thematic Findings




  Dozens of interviews, group discussions, and direct
  observations of posyandu and other health-related activities
  and behaviors in the five villages described above generated
  a diverse set of recurring themes, discussed below under
  three sub-headers that roughly correspond with the research
  questions:     “Chronic Undernutrition” addresses RQ1,
  identifying factors that improve or worsen maternal and child
  nutrition in Generasi villages; “Capacities and Involvement”
  addresses both RQ2 and RQ3, and examines the ways in which
  different stakeholders understand and interact with health
  providers and the Generasi program; and “Elite Control and
  Elite Capture” addresses RQ3, looking specifically at how
  formal and informal leaders at the village and sub-district
  levels implement and leverage nutrition-related services via
  either Generasi or health providers.




                                      35
Chronic
Undernutrition



RQ 1
            Chronic undernutrition remains poorly understood and unaddressed within
            Indonesia’s public health system, which responds more effectively to cases of acute
            malnutrition. National studies have estimated the prevalence of stunting in children
            at 37% (Riskesdas 2007). The following research findings suggest a diverse set of
            issues at the sub-district and village level that contribute to this persistent public
            health challenge.



            Generasi Food Supplements at Posyandu: Unintended Consequences

            Informants in all five villages consistently reported what has generally been
            acknowledged as Generasi’s biggest success: increasing posyandu participation and
            attendance, in part through the provision of food supplements. Food supplements
            at the posyandu, called “outreach supplements” because of their drawing power,
            are one of Generasi’s most effective tools to reintroduce parents and their children
            to the front lines of public health service delivery in their own communities. In turn,
            increased attendance improves preventive surveillance of mothers and children at
            risk for undernutrition.

            Nevertheless in all five villages, outreach supplements are always Generasi’s largest
            health-related expenditure. Evidence for the effectiveness of complementary feeding
            strategies as a tool to prevent undernutrition is lacking (Bhutta et al., 2013), and since
            posyandu is a monthly event, the supplements do not actually address or prevent
            cases of chronic undernutrition. Furthermore, Generasi actors tend to purchase
            simple packaged products of questionable nutritional value such as biscuits that are
            easy to procure in bulk and do not quickly expire.

            Some unintended side effects of Generasi’s food supplements include:


            Reproducing What the Puskesmas Already Includes (or Should Include) in its
            Operational Budget: In the best cases, such as what researchers found in Pandeyan,
            the village midwives coordinate with Generasi actors to ensure that no communities
            receive food supplements from both the puskesmas (or other government source)
            and Generasi. This can be an effective solution for puskesmas that are chronically
            underfunded and cannot meet the demand for their entire sub-district. In other cases,


                                              36
researchers detected a slide toward complacency wherein some puskesmas choose to
reduce their coverage area of food supplements, recognizing that Generasi can make
up the difference. At the district level in Pamekasan, health officials told researchers
that the annual budget for food supplements was removed and redirected toward
financing the upcoming district elections. Indeed at the puskesmas in Pandeyan
the nutrition specialist only had supplements for acute cases of malnutrition and
there was no budget for outreach supplements to be provided at monthly posyandu
activities, though they have had it in the past. Generasi, or the village communities
themselves, provide it instead, and rather effectively. In the worst case scenario
as in Bonde, puskesmas staff resent Generasi involvement in the business of food
supplement altogether and refrain from monitoring underweight cases that receive
assistance from Generasi. If the goal of Generasi is to stimulate demand for public
services, in some instances the provision of supplements through Generasi has had
the unintended effect of reducing supply-side accountability to communities.


Producing Only a Temporary Demand: One of the big successes of Generasi is
improved attendance at fully staffed posyandu, and the volunteers and Generasi staff
all credit the availability of food supplements that draw parents to attend with their
children. In Bonde, where the annual Generasi budget has steadily decreased for the
past three years, Generasi can no longer consistently provide food supplements for
posyandu activities as they had in prior years, and volunteers notice that attendance
has subsequently decreased.

Removes Incentives for Community Initatives: A long-time posyandu volunteer
in Bonde’s Bena village noted that before either Generasi or the puskesmas offered
food supplements for posyandu activities, the volunteers and village leaders
procured their own food for the monthly posyandu. This posyandu in Bena used to
attract parents to attend by holding arisan (revolving credit) activities every month at
the posyandu. They would also purchase food for the monthly posyandu through
communal cash contributions, something which the villages in Pandeyan, Pamekasan
still do, but in Bena the prevailing attitude has changed to one of dependency on
either the puskesmas or Generasi to provide the food that draws attendance. The
Generasi district facilitator for East Manggarai recognized this as a side effect of
the posyandu food supplement, and wondered if Generasi might better spend its
budget on networking, lobbying, or advocacy activities that might stimulate a return
to community-led initiatives.

                         Local Diet

                         In Bonde, the dietary mainstay is referred to as “makan segitiga,” a “triangle diet”
                         whose three points are water, vegetables, and salt (air, sayur, dan garam). The
                         research team witnessed this as a daily mainstay in most households in Dantena and
                         Bena (see Image 1 below). Either a local variety of squash or cassava leaves are
                         boiled in salted water, and then poured over an enormous plate of rice. Interestingly,
                         these were not households in extreme poverty. Most farming families own their own
                         land; they are not sharecroppers. Most households keep chickens, and many also
                         raise pigs and goats, but these are reserved for enormous social obligations known as
                         sida, mandatory contributions of livestock (or money) when members of the extended
                         family get married or pass away, or for sale at the market.


“We typically sell the livestock           “Our livestock is for income, not      “Even when we have chickens or
that we have in order to buy rice.         to eat.”                               pigs, it wouldn’t feel appropriate
Besides that, here [in Manggarai]                                                 to eat it ourselves given that we
we have a tradition called sida,           (Magdalena, Women’s FGD participant,   still need money.”
where all members of an extended           Dantena)
family must make communal                                                         (Yati, Women’s FGD participant, Dantena)
contributions, so that when there
are activities such as parties and
celebrations, everyone must
contribute. That’s why people
in Manggarai cannot get ahead;
their traditions mandate too many
social contributions.”

(Village Secretary, Dantena)




                         Despite their own livestock, most households in Bonde do not have a routine source
                         of protein in their daily diet. By contrast, in Pandeyan, families in Badran and Suruan
                         also eat meat rarely but they are surrounded by vegetarian sources of protein,
                         especially peanuts, tofu, and tempe.

                                                             38
                 Childrearing Practices

                 Wives and husbands in Bonde typically work in their gardens (primarily grooming
                 and harvesting coffee, cacao, or clove trees in this mountainous region), sometimes
                 for days at a time. Mothers either leave their young children with a relative in the
                 village or take them along to the gardens, but in either case informants report
                 that most parents are unable to prioritize either a nutritious diet or a stimulating
                 social environment for their children. In empty homes, or alone up in their gardens,
                 researchers observed children eating the same “triangle diet” as their parents, with
                 very little direct engagement for integrated growth and development.




                 Hygiene Practices

                 The complex problem of undernutrition also requires attention to local environment
                 and hygiene practices such provision of toilets, access to clean drinking water, and
                 handwashing promotion. Attention to environmental hygiene helps reduce inadvertent
                 consumption of enteropathic bacteria, which stimulate a growth-suppression immune
                 response (Humphrey 2009). Almost all children in Bonde, especially in Hamlet 2 of
                 Dantena village, appear to live with minor but persistent respiratory infections, and
                 they spend their days playing without shoes, frequently in open sewage areas (see
                 Images 2 & 3 below).

Women Factory Workers

The research team came across a surprising side topic of relevance
during the pilot phase in Ciperi sub-district of Sukabumi, West Java.
In 2012, five out of the six cases of maternal mortality in Ciperi were
women who worked in factories, drawing attention to the labor
practices of factories and compliance with a minimum standard
of maternity benefits and workplace provisions for pregnant
employees. In response, the midwives at the Ciperi puskesmas
have initiated biannual health exams for factory workers, and
report a begrudging and minimal level of cooperation from the
factory managers. Nevertheless, many ordinary residents in Ciperi,
and even elsewhere in Sukabumi district, were quite aware of the
maternity risks and other health issues faced by peri-urban factory
workers, reflecting an uneasy relationship with the still recent entry
of manufacturing industries into their community. As this issue
presented itself during the brief pilot phase, and also because
the health issues faced by factory workers was slightly outside the
scope of research, the team could not pursue this surprising finding
in more depth. The research team left Ciperi with a strong sense
that this presents a compelling avenue for additional research, not
least because it likely connects with the problem of chronic energy
deficiency in pregnant women (see immediately below).




Rare Acknowledgement of Chronic Energy Deficiency (KEK)

The cases of maternal mortality among factory workers in Ciperi
draw attention to the nutritional risk of chronic energy deficiency
(known as KEK in Indonesian, Kekurangan Energi Kronis) in
pregnant women, who are far more likely to give birth to
underweight infants who then grow up with a disproportionate risk
of chronic malnutrition (Victora et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2007).
The research team found an alarming lack of awareness of KEK
at the village level, while midwives and health professionals rarely
mentioned it on their own as a nutritional risk for mothers and their
infants. Instead health professionals regard KEK as primarily a risk
for pregnancy complications. When asked directly, most midwives
could define KEK, and mentioned that arm measurements are
a routine part of their pre-natal exams. As chronic malnutrition
becomes an object of increased focus as Indonesia aims to improve
maternal and child health, then education about and outreach to
women with KEK must improve.

Capacities and   Generasi’s Incentivized Block Grants
Involvement      One of the sub-districts surveyed in this study (Bonde in NTT) received
                 incentivized block grants since the start of the impact evaluation (the


RQ 2             Treatment A group) in 2007, while the other two sub-districts started receiving
                 their incentivized grants in 2009. All five villages should have been informed
                 of these block grant incentives to achieve Generasi’s target indicators since
                 at least 2010. A surprising finding about the block grant incentives was the
                 general lack of acknowledgement, awareness, or knowledge among village


RQ 3             communities, including among some of the Generasi actors themselves.
                 For example, one of the Generasi KPMD in Bena village in Bonde revealed
                 a fundamental misunderstanding of how the incentivized grants work when
                 she told interviewers she was disappointed to learn that the “incentive” or
                 “bonus” for achieving target indicators was not a personal reward for Generasi
                 actors themselves but rather for the whole community. While observing the
                 posyandu in Dantena’s Hamlet 2, interviewers asked the hamlet leader about
                 Generasi’s incentivized block grants, but he only shook his head and said he
                 did not know about any bonus system. He looked suspiciously at the PK for
                 Dantena, who was also a part of the conversation, and he too answered that
                 he did not know much about an incentive system. Meanwhile in Pandeyan
                 sub-district, the PK in Suruan village told interviewers that the incentive
                 grants are discussed at the inter-village fund allocation meetings at the sub-
                 district level (musyawarah antar desa (MAD) alokasi dana), and in Suruan and
                 Badran at least, information about these incentives is not disseminated to the
                 community. The extra funds may be reflected on the total budgets posted on
                 public bulletin boards, but the budgets are not itemized to reflect the added
                 reward for achieving annual targets, much less announced or promoted
                 as such. The Suruan PK suggested that this was to prevent social jealousy
                 between Generasi villages. Given this limited knowledge of the incentive
                 block grants, it seems unlikely that these grants, whether awarded or not, have
                 any incentive effect in achieving improved nutritional outcomes.



                 Productive Collaborations

                 With so many different stakeholders involved in local nutritional outcomes,
                 the very process of communication, coordination, and collaboration poses
                 a multi-facted challenge. At least one central figure—the village midwife—
                 consistently emerges as a focal point (see Case Study #1) through which
                 Generasi and other stakeholders must interact when concerned with the
                 nutritional status of women and their children.

                 Between Local Health and Generasi Actors: After a few days in Bonde,
                 the research team encountered strained relations between the professional
                 midwives and the Generasi program, whereas in Pandeyan there was routine



                                          41
and close coordination. In fact, in Pandeyan the coordinating midwife at the puskesmas
shared some of the same concerns about Generasi as the coordinating midwife in
Puskesmas Bonde. They both lamented a lack of awareness or involvement in Generasi’s
activities in health domains usually under their purview.4 What mitigates the situation in
Pandeyan are the village midwives who work closely with village-level Generasi program
managers, whereas in Bonde there were no full time midwives present in the villages,
which short circuits the link between Generasi activities on the ground and health
professionals at the sub-district level. In Bonde there were opinions and blame on both
sides, but it seemed clear that users on the demand side did not benefit from these kinds
of standoffs over issues such as who decides what constitutes correct food supplements
(and perhaps more importantly, who purchases it).

Between Midwives and Posyandu Cadres: The difference in the level of coordination
and collaboration between village midwives and the local volunteers who manage the
posyandu leads to striking outcomes. In the Bonde sub-district of East Manggarai,
posyandu cadres consistently report that the village midwife only attends special posyandu
activities such as when there is Vitamin A distribution. Even though the midwives are
typically absent, the cadres in East Manggarai are prevented from conducting critical
outreach and detection activities (see ‘Control and Protection of Specialized Nutrition
Knowledge’ section below), and feel disempowered to do anything other than carry out
the mechanical functions of a posyandu clinic such as weighing babies and filling the
register. Compare with observations in the Pandeyan sub-district of Pamekasan, where
village midwives live in their assigned villages and coordinate closely with their posyandu
cadres, fill out the registers together after every monthly activity, and encourage routine
training activities for cadres so that they too may identify undernutrition and other health
problems for referral in their communities.

Between Midwives and Traditional Birth Attendants: In Ciperi, Bonde, and Pandeyan,
the research team heard about “partnership (kemitraan) agreements” between village
midwives and traditional birth attendants (dukun beranak or TBA). The essential point
of these agreements insists that TBA must no longer deliver infants on their own, and
are instead given an incentive to arrange and accompany pregnant women in labor
to a trained midwife, preferably at a health facility. In exchange, the TBA will receive
somewhere between Rp20-50,000, almost always taken from the midwife’s jampersal
insurance reimbursement. These local agreements are based on a national policy
framework published by MoH in 2011.5 These guidelines describe how TBAs can support
midwives and indirectly contribute to reduce maternal and child mortality. In the best
instances, midwives know all of the TBA in their community, and encourage TBAs to be
involved in pre-natal and post-natal care. But more commonly the research team found
that midwives merely tolerated or openly scorned TBAs as an archaic nuisance; the
“partnerships” are seen as a tool to sideline and eventually stamp out TBAs altogether.

                                                42
In Ciperi and Pandeyan, health professionals formally implemented these “partnership
agreements” between midwives and TBAs. In Bonde there was talk about partnership,
at least to make sure that the TBAs registered with the puskesmas were aware of
the Revolusi KIA program (for more on Revolusi KIA, see below), but none of the
TBAs that researchers interviewed in Bonde had heard of the program, nor of any
partnership agreements. Despite the cultural sensitivity and practical breadth written
into the national guidelines that acknowledge an important role for TBAs throughout
the entire childbirth cycle, in local practice the main goal of partnership agreements
is to prevent TBAs delivering babies on their own, and to encourage TBAs to refer
pregnant women to trained midwives. Cooperative TBAs will make referrals and even
accompany women to a health facility when they go into labor. In return, the midwife
typically gives a small payment (usually around 40,000 rupiah, roughly USD4.00).
Given this rather narrow interpretation and implementation of MoH’s broadly defined
policy framework for TBA partnerships, Generasi has an opportunity to mobilize
this underutilized and undercompensated village resource. (For more on TBAs, see
immediately below.)



Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs)

Plenty of evidence suggests that TBAs persist as respected figures among women,
not least because they provide advice and care throughout the entire childbirth cycle.
While researchers found examples of TBA who still rely on questionable methods
and knowledge, just as often they found others that were fully informed on aspects
of nutritious diet and hygienic practices, suggesting that the persistence of TBAs in
local communities presents an opportunity and not a nuisance for the health system
(and to Generasi).

Each village surveyed had active TBAs in the community, and yet both Generasi actors
and health professionals initially denied their presence when researchers asked about
them. In retrospect this appears puzzling considering the aforementioned midwife-
TBA partnership agreements sanctioned by MoH (see immediately above). When
health officials and Generasi actors eventually acknowledged the existence of TBAs
in their community, some described TBAs as an anti-modern institution that they
are trying to eradicate. Other more culturally competent informants spoke of TBAs
as respected customary figures in the community that are here to stay, and noted
that the health system must learn how to work together with them. Nevertheless
all health officials without exception described TBAs as bandel, which means
recalcitrant, disobedient, or stubborn. The term is typically reserved for children
and thus has deeply patronizing overtones. TBAs who are still bandel (and the
mothers, also bandel, who continue to solicit their services) become the scapegoat
for high maternal and infant mortality rates, which was how the head of the Pandeyan
puskesmas explained the unacceptably high figures from a few years ago (see Table
2 above). Perhaps in response to this prevailing attitude toward TBAs and their users,



                                 43
the partnership agreements, in addition to focusing only on referral to midwives
for childbirth, typically rely upon a system of reward and punishments to ensure
compliance. Punishments frequently invoke and include security actors (local police
and military actors) to enforce them in an effort to scare TBAs and their clients into
compliance. The head of the puskesmas in Pandeyan explained why:



            “We still value and honor the TBAs in the villages, they are products of the
            local culture, but they require monitoring. So we conduct a ‘social audit,’6
            by inviting army officers from the Pandeyan sub-district command unit
            (koramil) and police officers from the Pandeyan precinct (polsek). The TBAs
            are afraid of them. Ideally we do a social audit with security actors. Their
            presence is important, to scare the TBAs. These are the social sanctions we
            have developed and implemented.”7

            — Head of Pandeyan Puskesmas




Generasi typically has minimal involvement with village TBAs and the partnership
agreements described here, with one notable exception. In Pandeyan, Generasi
supported the puskesmas’ socialization of the new midwife-TBA partnership
agreements, paying for two meetings at the sub-district level and followed-up
with meetings in each village. Given their formulation and implementation, these
new regulations might only euphemistically be called “agreements,” much less
“partnerships,” instead of the top-down and martial directives that they are in
practice. Rather than support this sort of partnership between midwives and TBAs,
Generasi might explore a more inclusive and equitable interpretation of the MoH
framework that explicitly encourages a persuasive and educative approach instead
of compulsion.

As late as the 1990s, the health system had an accreditation program for TBAs, and
some of the more elderly TBAs showed their training certificates to interviewers. But
with or without training, TBAs persist as a local institution and community resource
not least because women know them well, and trust them. As MoH guidelines
acknowledge, TBAs are actively involved in the entire childbirth cycle, from confirming
pregnancies, to various pre- and post-natal care practices, to spiritual guidance and
pastoral care. The partnership agreements do not adequately compensate TBAs for
their services to women when midwives are either unavailable or too busy to attend

7. > The MoH policy guidelines encourage a multi-sectoral approach to the development and implementation of
	     midwife-TBA partnership agreements. For example, the guidelines specifically mention the inclusion of sub-district
	     health officials, civilian sub-district leaders, formal village leaders, informal community leaders and religious
	     leaders, but the MoH document never mentions nor alludes to the inclusion of security actors from the police or
	     military. Fieldwork from this research and at least one other PNPM-sponsored research project shows that the 		
	     formal inclusion of security actors occurs variously and inconsistently at the provincial, district, or sub-district level.

to pregnancy needs that are not strictly medical. To be sure, some TBAs do rely on
practices that may actively complicate the health of mothers and their infants, but
many others certainly understand the basics of hygienic maternal and child health
care and nutrition.8 If the health system and Generasi do not involve the TBAs, it
is a missed opportunity to mobilize an active, trusted, available and inexpensive
community resource on behalf of improved health outcomes for women and their
children.



Normative Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (Deservingness)

Questions surrounding “who deserves what,” or “deservingness,” have recently
received attention in social science discussions around healthcare, recognizing that
“moral conceptions of deservingness are foundational to all discussions of health-
related attention, care, and investment,” but still remain “notably understudied and…
poorly understood” (Willen 2012, p. 819). One reason is because assumptions of
deservingness are typically implicit and taken for granted. As opposed to questions
of universal, but abstract, health rights, typically expressed through juridical discourse,
questions of deservingness require attention to “vernacular moral registers” that are
“situationally specific and often context-dependent,… liable to shift and change”
(2012, p. 814).

While conducting fieldwork, the researchers encountered several examples of
implicitly articulated exclusion criteria that created local hierarchies of deservingness
when discussing the Generasi program and nutritional outcomes for mothers and
their young children. In Bonde, when Generasi actors, health officials, and several
program beneficiaries discussed a recent maternal mortality case in Dantena village,
no one failed to mention that the deceased mother of seven (formerly eight, one of
her toddlers died one year before she did) lived with a mental illness. The extent
of her exclusion from the community was readily apparent when many informants
explained that they had not even noticed she was pregnant when she fell into a
seizure during the seventh month of her ninth pregnancy. Dantena’s village midwife
told researchers that she would not include this case in her routine data reports to the
Bonde puskesmas specifically because she had a mental illness.

Another apparent example of a local hierarchy of deservingness from Bonde is
discussed in some additional detail under the “Control and Protection of Specialized
Nutrition Knowledge” header below, which notes the exclusion of Generasi
beneficiaries who receive food supplements from follow-up monitoring by health
officials. Through interviews with the puskesmas staff, the posyandu volunteers in
Bena village, and Generasi actors, the research team discovered that if Generasi

		 pate in accreditation trainings when they were still offered in the 1990s and earlier, researchers could not 	
		 discern any particular patterns that distinguished TBAs knowledgeable of best practices from those who were 	
		 not. In general, TBAs credit their intuition garnered from their years of experience.



                                            45
provided food supplements to households with undernourished mothers or children,
then the puskesmas staff would exclude them from monitoring. In the explicit words
of the midwife coordinator at the Bonde puskesmas, only families that receive food
supplements directly from the puskesmas deserve follow-up care. The puskesmas
staff argue that only they are empowered to determine who is and who is not
undernourished. The Generasi actors and posyandu volunteers argue that it takes
the puskesmas staff too long to make that determination when some families are
clearly suffering, and so they go ahead and provide assistance. In these situations,
the puskesmas staff then refuse to acknowledge and follow-up with these households.

In Pandeyan researchers encountered a different hierarchy of deservingness. Health
officials, posyandu volunteers, and Generasi actors all bemoaned the ignorance of
particular religious residents in their community who refused to access public health
services. They blamed particular religious leaders who forbid their followers from
using family planning services, immunizing their children, or attending posyandu.
These non-users were described to researchers as “unaware,” “stubborn,” or
“backwards” in their attitudes toward health services. This becomes an explanatory
model that in turn allows Pandeyan’s lower health outcomes relative to other sub-
districts in Pamekasan to persist without a sense of urgency. In Suruan, health officials
and posyandu volunteers operationalize this local conceptualization of deservingness
in at least two ways. First, instead of using a more persuasive approach (an example
of which researchers found in Ciperi; see “Bu Haji” in Case Study #2), health officials
and posyandu volunteers would ask religious families to sign a letter that explicitly
acknowledges that they refused the services that were offered to them. While the
refusal of services in Pandeyan is self-initiated by some of the more religious members
of the community (or instructed by a third party, their religious leaders), the act of
signing a letter becomes a literal act of “writing them off ” their books, which leads
to the second method by which the local hierarchy of deservingness in Pandeyan
leads to concrete outcomes. After formally documenting the service refusers, health
officials and posyandu volunteers restrict the distribution of food supplements to
posyandu users only. One of the posyandu volunteers introduced the researchers to
one of these non-user households in which the husband forbid his wife from bringing
their children to posyandu. Some of the children were obviously unkempt and too
small and thin for their age, but they are not eligible for food supplements.

These examples show some of the ways that prevailing conceptions of “deservingness”
result in particular forms of exclusion of some members of the community not just from
available health services, but also from the compilation of health data. Deservingness
is a particular challenge because assumptions of who deserves what are embedded
and naturalized in the communities where Generasi operates, and these prevailing
beliefs include health and Generasi actors.

The Revolusi KIA Program: Unintended Consequences

The so-called Maternal and Child Health Revolution (known as Revolusi KIA in Indonesian)
in NTT province, has had some unintended consequences. Formally launched by the
NTT governor in 2009, the stated purpose of the Revolusi KIA program is to provide
assurance and protections to mothers and their infants through the provision of maternal
and child health care services without discrimination.9 The program aggressively
addresses NTT’s notoriously high maternal and infant mortality.10 According to the NTT
Department of Health, the sources of such high maternal and infant mortality are poor
access to trained health professionals and properly equipped facilities. The Revolusi
KIA program requires all pregnant women to deliver their infants in accredited health
facilities and receives significant international donor support.

Particularly striking to the researchers during fieldwork was the aggressiveness with which
the goals of Revolusi KIA were relentlessly pursued by health officials and providers
to the detriment of the quality assurances and human protections that the program
was meant to achieve. Whenever researchers broached the subject of Revolusi KIA
with health officials, the first response was invariably laughter. The head of the East
Manggarai district health office expressed skepticism about the program when he told
his interviewers that “the people of NTT have been overly euphoric about Revolusi
KIA,” explaining that NTT’s infrastructure, health facilities, and human resources are still
inadequate to support the goals of the program. The result, he lamented, is that health
officials have “adapted” (disesuaikan) the program’s implementation to East Manggarai’s
conditions and available resources: “Revolusi KIA has been too hard to implement, so
we develop our own versions of the program in each region.”

How Revolusi KIA operates in the field does not accord with the program’s technical
guidelines. In Bonde sub-district, researchers detected that health providers at the
puskesmas were under an extraordinary amount of pressure to deliver outcomes that
demonstrate Revolusi KIA’s success. There was evidence that midwives and program
managers are producing “fictive” data in order to meet Revolusi KIA targets when
researchers observed that the data contained in posyandu register notebooks did not
match puskesmas reports on standard maternal and child health indicators. Indeed, in
a discussion with Dantena’s midwife, when asked about the recent maternal mortality
case in her village after she told us there have been none during the past few years, she
forthrightly explained that “I purposely decided not to mention that case…” because
the mother had a mental illness, and this was her justification for not including her death
in the puskesmas reports. “Otherwise,” she explained, with visible emotion, “I would
not meet my [Revolusi KIA] targets.”11 (see also Case Study #1)

broader community of local elites also appears to determine the success or
failure of programs that support improved nutritional outcomes. Researchers
met several formal and informal community leaders performing decisive roles
in the success of Generasi and posyandu activities. In general, researchers
discovered that Generasi provides opportunities for elites to retain and fortify
                                                                                                                  RQ 3
their social standing. As brokers delivering CDD resources into their com-
munities, local elites leverage Generasi to accumulate additional status for
themselves. Without exception, every Generasi actor that the researchers
met held other leadership roles in their community and maintained close ties
with the local structures of village and sub-district governance.12 Likewise, the
more successful posyandu were led by local volunteers who also participated
as leaders in other aspects of their community. Such a dynamic does not auto-
matically call into question the altruistic motives of these leaders. The findings
of this study support earlier research on PNPM by Dasgupta and Beard who
concluded that “not all elites who had power were corrupt, a finding that high-
lights the important distinction between elite control and elite capture. Local
elites were willing and able to contribute the time and know-how needed
to facilitate community-level projects and governance” (Dasgupta & Beard,
2007, p. 244). One of the strategies that local elites use to maintain their
control if not the capture of Generasi resources is by appointing members
of their extended family or trusted confidantes in their personal network to
manage Generasi activities. If the longer term goal of Generasi aims to break
the cycle of poverty by generating demand for education and health services,
in the short and medium term Generasi should recognize how elite networks
leverage Generasi activities to consolidate their position in the local communi-
ties where they have influence, at the expense of some of the democratizing
benefits that Generasi aims to facilitate.

A reliance on local leaders to ensure Generasi’s success also implies that
Generasi activities risk failure when those leaders either opt-out of participation
or participate counter-productively as spoilers to program success. The
interesting question is whether and how local elites use this process of status
accumulation via Generasi to generate beneficial outcomes for non-elites in
their community, or to act as spoiler agents of elite capture. Case Study #2
demonstrates how these dynamics work through a collection of profiles in
strategic leadership in the villages visited by the research team.

Control and Protection of Specialized Nutrition Knowledge

In Bonde, the research team repeatedly discovered (expressed by both the demand
and supply side) that health providers, midwives in particular, claimed and protected
a specialized nutritional knowledge as a marker of professional expertise. This mani-
fests in two specific ways:

that the reason why there were so few cases of malnutrition despite the large number
of posyandu records that show children “under the red line” (bawah garis merah) on
their weight-for-age growth charts is because they do not meet the criteria for mal-
nutrition. When an under-five child’s weight-for-age falls beneath the red line or if
the child does not gain (or loses) weight three months in a row, then the midwife will
make a referral to determine whether the child suffers from malnutrition. At the pusk-
esmas, trained health professionals use the WHO/NCHS13 standard for determining
who is malnourished, and in Bonde only they can do this. Since midwives rarely
attend the monthly posyandu in Dantena or Bena villages, the midwife’s posyandu
register books (which someone else fills in for her) are sent back to the puskesmas for
evaluation where she will inspect and look for the children who require referral. But
researchers observed directly that these posyandu registers sit in a pile at the pusk-
esmas, resulting in weeks or months of delay between data collection and detection.
More often there is no detection at all because midwives never find the time to care-
fully go through the registers. Back in the villages, posyandu volunteers and Generasi
actors have been told repeatedly that they are not even qualified to make referrals.




13. > In 1999, WHO [the World Health Organization] defined severe malnutrition in children as a weight-for-height 		
	      below -3 standard deviations (based on the NCHS [US National Center for Health Statistics] reference) and/or
	      the presence of oedema.” (World Health Organization 2009, p. 3)




                                              49
2. Determining correct food supplements: Likewise only puskesmas staff (prefer-
ably a nutritionist or midwife) may determine the correct food supplements that a
child needs to recover once diagnosed with malnutrition. When the midwife does
not attend posyandu or visit the village, communities go ahead and choose food
supplements on their own via Generasi, leading to the strained relations described
above between the puskesmas midwives and Generasi staff in Bonde. In fact, there
are no significant differences between the supplements provided by Generasi and
the puskesmas, typically a bulk purchase of biscuits and milk formula. Respondents
in both Dantena and Bena villages reported that although they gratefully accept food
supplements procured by the Generasi program, they would prefer their village mid-
wives to assign the “correct” menu instead, because they too believe that only health
professionals know how to prescribe a nutritious diet for underweight women and
children. Furthermore, recipient communities argue that puskesmas staff will follow-
up to ensure that the beneficiaries recover, whereas Generasi does not do specialized
case management. But when Generasi purchases food supplements, the puskesmas
then abdicates their monitoring responsibilities for the recipient community because
they feel that their authority in matters of nutritional health has been sidestepped.


This attitude toward specialized knowledge in Bonde appears all the more puzzling
when compared with what the research team found in Pandeyan, where posyandu
volunteers had the training, knowledge, and confidence to recognize signs of
undernutrition, and knew how to refer cases to the village midwife. The midwives
in both Badran and Suruan villages lived in their communities for many years, and
coordinated productively with the Generasi program to ensure that food supplements
from either the pusksesmas or Generasi were not overlapping.

  A Tale of Two
  Midwives



  Introduction


  Two of the village midwives we met, one assigned to
  Dantena (in Bonde sub-district, East Manggarai, NTT) and
  the other to Suruan (in Pandeyan sub-district, Pamekasan,
  East Java) provided the Generasi nutrition research team
  with a study of astonishing diametrical contrasts in their
  attitudes and practices, their receptions in their host
  communities, and their collaborations with the Generasi
  program.14 Both were born and raised in the regions
  where they work, each fluent in the local language, but
  neither come originally from the specific villages where
  they have been assigned to work. They may both be
  categorized as local elites in their respective sub-
  districts, but the similarities end there, because how they
  wield their elite status — whether or not they genuinely
  seek to improve the social welfare of the communities
  where they work — makes all the difference between an
  accomplished advocate and a neglectful spoiler.

Suruan’s village midwife, Ibu Nurhayati

When Ibu Nurhayati describes the work of outreach (penyuluhan) in Suruan where she
has lived and worked as the village midwife since 1998, she flashes a wide knowing
smile and sighs with resignation, “it’s all about talking and talking (bicara dan bicara)…
talking and talking… it never ends.” Such an apparently Sisyphean task, however, has
yielded impressive results over the past 12-13 years that she has worked in Suruan.

Ibu Nur explained many of the local beliefs in Pandeyan that informed women’s
resistance to come to her clinic. We verified these local perceptions of the midwife’s
clinic from several additional and varied informants. First, historically most women
in Pandeyan manage their pregnancies at home, and traditional birth attendants
(TBAs) come over to assist with deliveries. Second, any trip to a clinic would send a
signal to the surrounding community that the mother is suffering from some kind of
pregnancy complication. In such cases, the entire community typically accompanies
the patient to the clinic and creates an embarrassing public drama for young mothers
that they prefer to avoid. Third, and this is less intuitive to outsiders, is the local
interpretation that pregnancy complications (or even painful deliveries in general)
are a sign of shameful secrets (aib) within the household, so women not only avoid
the clinic to prevent rumors from spreading, but they also try to keep quiet when
they deliver at home. Fourth, perhaps related to the second point above, is a fearful
association of the clinic with painful, invasive, and embarrassing procedures such
as sitting exposed on a delivery table (“disuruh ngangkang”) or using a needle and
thread to sew stitches (“takut dijahit”) after delivering their babies. Finally, a widely
held taboo prevents women from leaving their houses during the first 40 days after
delivering their infants, precluding visits to the clinic for post-natal care.

For all these reasons, during the first four years that Ibu Nur worked and lived in
Suruan, few women would voluntarily visit her clinic. Instead, she had to proactively
assist with, or “intercept,” deliveries by going directly to a mother’s house while she
was giving birth with a TBA. She recalls with grateful and historic clarity when the first
mother delivered her baby at the village clinic in 2004:



                                  52
           “ Her name was Ibu S. She was the first to come on her own to give birth at
           my village clinic (polindes). It was Ibu S who promoted my services to the
           others, assuring them it was comfortable, that I provided a pain killer, that I
           ensured their privacy, that the recovery was quick, and that she was able to
           walk again only a day after giving birth. After that, one by one the women in
           Suruan would come to deliver their babies with me at the clinic. “
           — Ibu Nurhayati (Suruan’s village midwife)




 Ibu Nur includes the local TBAs in her program of pre-natal, delivery, and post-natal
 care for mothers in Suruan. She not only makes sure that Suruan’s TBAs participate
 in the mandatory “partnership” between midwives and TBAs in the Pandeyan sub-
 district for the past two years, she also goes out of her way to make sure that every
 pregnant woman has a TBA that she feels comfortable using. All TBA that assist in the
 care of pregnant women receive Rp20,000 for simply being present and conducting
 the non-medical aspects of childbirth, and an additional Rp20,000 if they actively
 escort the mothers they assist to Ibu Nur’s clinic. If a mother comes to deliver her
 baby at the clinic without a TBA, Ibu Nur will ask her directly if she uses a TBA, and
 will then call to invite the TBA to assist in the delivery.

All interview subjects in Suruan confirm that Ibu Nur attends every posyandu. One
mother, a posyandu user, told us that when Ibu Nur conducts outreach at the posyandu,
the participants wait to listen to her before they go home, and she holds question
and answer sessions.15 Ibu Nur’s popularity suggests that respected members of
the community can draw participants to the posyandu instead of depending upon
food supplements. She spends a lot of time training the posyandu volunteers, and
empowers them to identify families at risk and make referrals. When trainings for
volunteers are offered by the puskesmas, Generasi, or other programs, Ibu Nur
ensures that they each have their turn to participate. At the posyandu, she rotates
the volunteers through the “five tables” system of tasks. After every posyandu, she
sits with the volunteers to ensure that all the registers (and in Pandeyan they use a lot
more register notebooks than in Bonde or Ciperi) are filled in correctly.

In addition to coordinating all aspects of the monthly posyandu in each of Suruan’s five
hamlets, Ibu Nur coordinates a number of other health activities in the community’s
desa siaga, a village health awareness program. She started a local blood drive, and
even secured routine blood donations from the local kyai and his family who lead the
large pesantren in Suruan. She also coordinates a voluntary donations program via
the posyandu volunteers who manage the contributions every month. The money is
used for emergency referrals, small gift packages with useful supplies for new mothers
(talcum powder, baby soap, etc., see Image 5 below), and for blood type tests to
accompany the blood donations. Ibu Nur maintains a list of blood donors and their
blood type so that in the case of emergencies, she need not waste time finding the
correct donor. She also keeps track of available vehicles in Suruan, with a list of their
owners and phone numbers, that can be mobilized for emergency transportation.


15. > To be fair, we must note that Ibu Nurhayati told us a conflicting version of how outreach runs at the posyandu.
	     She has an acronym, D3K, which stands for “datang, ditimbang, dapat kue” (“come to posyandu, get weighed,
	     receive a snack”). She complained that they just want to get through posyandu quickly, and rarely stay for
	     outreach. The respondent who told us that everyone waits for Ibu Nur’s outreach may have told us what we
	     wanted to hear, with a normative response. Or, Ibu Nur, in her overall narrative about the challenges of outreach
	     and change (“talking and talking”) may have been self-effacing when describing the D3K phenomenon.
	     What matters here, at least, is that mothers reported without hesitation their admiration for their village midwife,
	     even if they embellished their active participation at the posyandu.

                                                    their infant receives immunizations.




                                               54
Ibu Nur maintains a good relationship with the Generasi program, and several
informants told us that the village facilitator always attends every posyandu together
with Ibu Nur. She credits Generasi with the revitalization of the posyandu program
in Suruan:



            “I used to have to weigh the babies and fill in the register myself, with
            only one or two volunteers for each posyandu. But now every posyandu
            has five volunteers thanks to Generasi’s transportation allowance. “
            — Ibu Nurhayati (Suruan’s village midwife)




Generasi has also supported the purchase of new scales and five tables for each
posyandu, and handheld loudspeakers, which the volunteers or hamlet leader use
to announce the monthly posyandu. Generasi has also supported multiple trainings
for both the volunteers and the users. But Generasi’s largest expense in Suruan,
per usual, is allocated for food supplements. For this Ibu Nur is in charge of telling
Generasi actors who should receive the supplements, and assists with the distribution.
This kind of village-level coordination between midwives and Generasi easily bridges
the kind of frictions between the health providers and Generasi that we observed in
Bonde.

Ibu Nurus reports delivering roughly 60 babies each year for a village population of
about 3,014 people (not including the pesantren students, which raises the total to
6,089). In order to prove that she was meeting all her targets despite the expected
“projection” figures (based on the pesantren population plus Suruan’s permanent
residents), she had to conduct a village census of her own, with assistance from the
posyandu volunteers, before the Pamekasan health officials would believe her.

During our interview with the Suruan village head, a close ally of the kyai, he told
us: “I hand over all health matters to Ibu Nurhayati, her posyandu volunteers, and
the Generasi program. Ibu Nur always coordinates with the village leadership and
provides a monthly report. She is always ready.” He also mentioned that in 2008-09,
the Pandeyan puskesmas received news that Ibu Nur would be transferred to another
village. But “the community rose up in protest,” because “they know exactly how
much she has done for us.”

The mother of an undernourished child who frequently consults with Ibu Nur also
affirmed what the village head told us: “Everyone has Ibu Nur’s cellphone number,
and she doesn’t mind receiving calls at any time… her husband is also socially-
minded. He is a school teacher here and mixes well with the community.” Together
this married couple of civil servants have earned a deep and abiding respect from
Suruan’s residents where they serve.

Dantena’s village midwife, Ibu Nancy

A new village clinic was built in Dantena in 2010, but it stands empty on the hillside
nestled between the village primary school and church (see Image 6). The clinic
was built to house at least two full time staff, a nurse and a midwife. The village
nurse, Ibu Wiwin, lives more than an hour away in the city of Ruteng, the capital of
neighboring Manggarai district, and the village midwife, Ibu Nancy, lives 40 minutes
away in the administrative center of Bonde sub-district, just a five minute walk from
the puskesmas along East Manggarai’s district highway. Both are supposed to live at
the clinic full time, but they claim that the spirits from the cemetery behind the clinic
scared them away. Instead, the nurse comes on weekday mornings, and the midwife
is on call if anyone needs her (all the posyandu volunteers and village leaders have
her cellphone number). The midwife coordinator at the Bonde puskesmas explained
that she has reminded them of their duty to stay in Dantena full time, but she can not
really force them to live there because in East Manggarai it would be too difficult to
replace them with equally qualified personnel. Perhaps just as important, Ibu Nancy
is married to an official from the Bonde sub-district office, who is also the PJOK
(penanggung jawab operasional kegiatan) for PNPM Generasi and MP programs in
Bonde, and it would be impolitic to replace Ibu Nancy and risk any repercussions.

The Generasi nutrition research team interviewed several mothers, posyandu
volunteers, TBAs, village leaders, and Generasi actors in Dantena to figure out
how this community copes without easy access to maternal and child health care,
including nutritional counseling. Many said this was why the TBAs are still active and
in demand in Dantena:

When we interviewed Ibu Maria, she had just given birth three months earlier, and her
mother-in-law, who is a TBA, assisted with the delivery: “My mother-in-law already
has experience. She helped a lot of women before me. She’s just as good as any
midwife.” When Ibu Nancy found out that Ibu Maria gave birth at home, she yelled



                                         56
      “I’ve seen some of the other           at her and asked why she did not call her, and then (according to
      mothers, when they want to             Ibu Maria) her mother-in-law yelled right back at Ibu Nancy: “How
      deliver their infants, sometimes
      they have to wait for a really long
                                             long would we have had to wait for you to get here? My daughter
      time at the village clinic until Ibu   could have died!”
      Nancy comes. That’s why it’s more
      comfortable for us to give birth at    The “kindness” of TBAs mentioned by Dantena’s village secretary
      home. If the midwife lived here        factored into other respondents’ unfavorable opinions of Ibu
      and was reliably available at all
                                             Nancy, who by many accounts treated Dantena’s women with sharp
      times, I would have preferred to
      use the midwife when I went into       disdain. Dantena informants reported that the TBAs have wisdom,
      labor. “                               understanding, and patience. By contrast, Ibu Nancy forbids
      — Yulia, a mother in Dantena.          women from yelling out or crying during their labor, and it was even
                                             reported that she gets cross and was quoted saying things like
      “The women here prefer to give         “Enough already, stop crying! It was pleasurable enough when you
      birth at home with help from the       made this baby, but now look who’s crying!”
      TBA because the TBA responds
      quickly and with kindness. When        The Generasi nutrition researchers were able to attend and observe
      we call the TBA (“mama dukun”),        both posyandu in Dantena, one in each of Dantena’s two hamlets,
      we only have to call her once and
                                             and Ibu Nancy did not attend either one. Dantena residents reported
      she comes immediately. When we
      call the midwife, we must wait, so     that Ibu Nancy only comes to posyandu during immunization and
      the women prefer the TBA. “            vitamin distribution months.
      — Dantena Village Secretary
                                             Before we heard any of these stories about Ibu Nancy, the Generasi
                                             nutrition research team met and interviewed her at her home near
                                             the puskesmas. Little did we know that much of what she told us
                                             turned out to be falsehoods. For example, she told us that she goes
                                             to her clinic daily, and that she not only attends every posyandu,
                                             but conducts a sweeping activity the day before to ensure that all
                                             women with children under five will attend, and another sweeping
                                             activity the day after to check all the mothers who did not come.
                                             She also told us that each hamlet’s posyandu in Dantena has 100%
                                             participation (later, we estimated it was less than 50%).

                                             But we realized something was amiss when we asked Ibu Nancy if
                                             there were any maternal mortality cases in Dantena, and she said
                                             that there had not been any in years. In fact, one of the reasons why
                                             we chose to visit Dantena was because of a recent maternal mortality
                                             case just a few weeks prior to our arrival that both the Generasi staff
                                             and the midwife coordinator at the Bonde puskesmas described
                                             to us. Every person who mentioned the case remarked that this
                                             mother of seven children (formerly eight, one of her toddlers died
                                             a year before she did) had a mental illness, and that no one knew
                                             she was pregnant until she fell into a seizure during the seventh

month of her ninth pregnancy.16 When we asked Ibu Nancy about the case during
our interview with her, she looked surprised and asked if the midwife coordinator (her
boss) already told us what happened. Her response was astonishing: “I purposely
avoided mentioning the case to you because that woman had a disturbed psyche,
and because her death would ruin our [Revolusi KIA] program targets.” Ibu Nancy
followed this statement with a laundry list of excuses to explain how she and the
entire Dantena community, failed to notice that she was pregnant. She also collected
evidence from the hospital to defend herself when the health department conducts
its required internal investigation into this death.

In Dantena’s Hamlet 1 we encountered another example of Ibu Nancy’s consequential
neglect and disdain that had a closer connection to the subject of childhood nutrition,
growth, and development. One mother in Dantena, Ibu Magdalena, was sure that her
16 month old daughter had some kind of undernutrition problem but could not get
a diagnosis from the village midwife because Ibu Nancy never came to the village.
Ibu Magdalena brought her daughter to the posyandu every month (the researchers
verified this by inspecting her daughter’s growth chart, with data points for every
month filled in). Indeed for the past three months, her daughter was “under the red
line,” and researchers observed the child was only 7,4kg, had a weak disposition, and
no appetite. When one of the posyandu volunteers informed Ibu Nancy about Ibu
Magdalena’s daughter, she casually responded with “oh, then we will give her food
supplements” without ever following up. Unlike in neighboring Bena village, the
Generasi actors in Dantena still followed the puskesmas’ rule that only health staff can
determine who receives food supplements, but Ibu Nancy never put Ibu Magdalena’s
daughter on the list, keeping her in a state of uncertainty.

In Dantena, the Generasi nutrition researchers encountered a situation that might
be described as overt “structural neglect.” Even Dantena’s village head lives near
the highway, at the administrative center of Bonde, where he runs a small business,
and leaves the management of daily affairs to his village staff. All of the formal
village officials that work for him as well as Dantena’s Generasi team live in Hamlet 1,
which has semi-finished road access to the highway, whereas Hamlet 2 is at a distinct
infrastructural and economic disadvantage with only a recently built (by PNPM Rural)
steep stone path accessible by only the sturdiest motorcycles.

While some of the posyandu volunteers in Hamlet 1 may be considered informal
village elites (including one of the Generasi village facilitators), the same cannot be
said for the volunteers in Hamlet 2, who have little say in the management of their
posyandu and village affairs. Knowledge of Generasi was very low in Hamlet 2, and
the volunteers only knew Generasi as the program that provided their transportation
money for working at the posyandu, and sometimes food supplements. As of May


16. >   Dantena’s nurse, Ibu Wiwin, told her interviewer that the four-year-old child had fevers and diarrhea when she 	
	       died. Her death is one more example of how the stigma of mental illness created a wall of invisibility that 		
	       prevented Ibu Nancy, Ibu Wiwin, and the Dantena community at large from detecting the serious health risks in 	
	       this woman’s household.

2013, there have been no “outreach” food supplements (snacks at the posyandu
to increase participation) since late 2012. Individual recipients of “recovery” food
supplements (mothers or children diagnosed with undernutrition) must walk up
to Hamlet 1 to get it themselves when Hamlet 1 holds their own posyandu. The
volunteer whose home has hosted Hamlet 2’s posyandu for more than ten years told
me that he is tired of working at posyandu, and frustrated that he has received no
compensation for offering his house over the years, but that village leaders would not
give him permission to resign. For such a long-term volunteer at the posyandu, his
record-keeping skills in the register were incomplete, and the register showed that
there were no posyandu held for four months in a row in 2012.

Among health professionals in the public sector, and even among some posyandu
volunteers, it is fashionable to blame parents in the villages for maternal and child
malnutrition because they are lazy, ignorant, stubborn, or too busy with more pressing
concerns. But at least in Hamlet 1 of Dantena, we discovered that mothers, TBAs,
and Generasi actors were quite aware of the health problems they faced and were
looking for solutions, but the available services failed to deliver the care they need.
Ibu Magdalena’s example above reveals that she is trying to help her daughter gain
weight and become healthier, but the village midwife failed to give her the care she
requested. We also met a young mother who received and understood general
nutrition tips from one of the village TBAs: “Mama dukun (the village TBA) told me
that if I am not producing enough breast milk that I need to eat more vegetables and
pork in order to produce more.” Another mother, Ibu Bernita, was quite aware of the
risks she faced during her second pregnancy but was still rebuffed when she pursued
the care she needed:



        “ I had an operation during my first pregnancy, so I knew that my second
        pregnancy might be risky, so I tried asking the midwife. However I was unable
        to get an answer from her, so I decided to go directly to the puskesmas and
        ask. Would you believe that when I arrived at the puskesmas, they got angry
        at me? They said ‘Why are you coming here to ask us when you already have
        a village midwife? “
        — Ibu Bernita, resident of Hamlet 1 in Dantena Village




These are the voices of women who attended Hamlet 1’s posyandu, where Generasi
hands over “recovery” food supplements to eligible families. Even without the
midwife and nurse, and with a volunteer staff reluctant to conduct health outreach or
referrals, these mothers still appreciated the availability of the posyandu:



        “ Even though I gave birth at home, I still come to the posyandu so that my
        child will be healthy. I come to the posyandu because I want to know each
        month whether my child’s weight has increased or decreased.”



                                                           59
In the absence of professional health care in this setting of structural neglect, we
found signs that the residents and leaders of at least Hamlet 1 are slowly adopting
Generasi’s cultivation of demand for services. The examples above show that many in
Dantena are acutely aware of what the midwife and the puskesmas are not delivering
to their community. In response Pak Stefanus, the Generasi PK for Dantena, told
us that the village head sent a letter more than a year ago to the head of the East
Manggarai Health Department requesting a new midwife, but he acknowledged the
futility of their effort when he mentioned that the midwife’s husband was the powerful
PJOK for Bonde. In an effort to call the midwife’s and nurse’s bluff over their stated
fear of the graveyard spirits behind the clinic, Pak Stefanus also told us that the village
leadership will consider switching the locations of the village clinic and the village
head’s office (at the spot where Image 6 was taken with the author’s camera). These
preliminary efforts at holding the health system accountable to Dantena’s needs may
be partially credited to the Generasi program for supporting posyandu activities,
showing the community how health services should be better than they are now, and
empowering Dantena’s leadership to demand a village midwife that actually lives in
their village.

Conclusion

In the constellation of village elites that can guarantee the success or failure of
Generasi’s efforts to improve demand for maternal and child health services,
particularly related to nutrition, the midwife performs an outsize role among them
all.17 Since Generasi actors at the sub-district and especially at the village level may
not be health experts (and are frequently perceived as unqualified to make health-
related decisions), the presence, cooperation, and, in the best cases, collaboration
of the village midwife makes all the difference, as the two contrasting examples
from Pamekasan and East Manggarai illustrate. Clearly other factors such as human
resource and infrastructure development have also contributed to radically different
outcomes in the two communities where these midwives work, but when it comes to
practical and proximate determinants of Generasi’s success in the health sector, the
village midwife is a crucial partner. At the puskesmas in both Bonde and Pandeyan,
the midwife coordinator bemoaned a lack of “coordination” between Generasi and
the puskesmas when it came to issues such as food supplements, but it was only in
Bonde where such complaints led to tensions that had negative consequences for
beneficiaries. The presence of full-time midwives in the villages in Pandeyan who
do coordinate with Generasi had a reassuring effect on the midwife coordinator at
Pandeyan’s puskesmas even if she did not know specifically what was happening
in each village, whereas in Bonde the lack of connection at the village level led to
punitive recriminations back and forth.

When Ibu Nurhayati describes outreach as an endless exercise in “talking and talking,”
she refers to the patience required to bring about change in health practices and local
demand for health services. It took her 13 years to build the level of awareness that
exists in Suruan today, whereas Dantena has never enjoyed the benefit of a full-time
trained health professional living in their midst to even begin the long work of talking
and talking to residents, with respect and dignity, about their health. Ibu Nurhayati’s
example offers two tentative lessons to Generasi, one obvious and the other implicit.
The obvious lesson is that Generasi’s work requires years of investment before nutritional
outcomes and demand for health services improve. We believe that Dantena’s letter to
the sub-district head, although essentially dead on arrival due to the current matrix of
political elites in Bonde, represents a newfound awareness that health services ought
to be available in their community, that the current state of structural and disdainful
neglect should not be the status quo.18 Although the posyandu in Dantena may not
be functioning at ideal capacity (especially in Hamlet 2), without Generasi there might
not be any posyandu at all. Generasi’s very act of supporting a routine posyandu, over
time, provides an alternative for Dantena’s residents to conceptualize what minimum
standards of maternal and child health care might look like, which then leads to tentative
and hopefully more assertive demand. The implicit lesson may be that what Ibu Nur calls
“talking and talking,” and what community driven development specialists might call
“advocacy,” could be a productive pursuit for the Generasi program in the future instead
of (or in addition to) its traditional focus on food supplements and volunteer incentives.

Epilogue from Dantena

While preparing the profiles in Case Study #2 (below), a follow-up phone call to Ibu
Dian, the Generasi KPMD and posyandu volunteer in Dantena village, revealed some
interesting improvements since our visit in May 2013. It turns out that our team of three
researchers from Jakarta, asking all kinds of questions about maternal and child health
care from all kinds of informants, and coming right after a recent maternal mortality
case, may have further increased what we detected was a slowly growing awareness of
the acute shortcomings in Datena’s maternal and child health care situation. After we
returned to Jakarta, Ibu Dian reported that someone from the East Manggarai district
level (unclear if it was from the health department or Generasi’s district facilitator) sent
an official warning to Dantena’s village midwife, Ibu Nancy. Now Ibu Nancy answers
her phone when Dantena residents call, and she arrives quickly on the scene when a
medical situation requires her attention, even in the middle of the night. This strengthens
our conclusion that there are productive possibilities for Generasi to engage in more
advocacy work (see Recommendations, Section 4, below).

larly slow-but-sure transformation in awareness of what government services that actually serve the community might
look like. In such a transformation, Dantena is still at a very early stage relative to Badran.

Introduction

This case study provides a cross-section of profiles
in “strategic leadership” that illustrate with specific
examples the general thematic findings described in
the main body of this report under the header “Local
Leadership.” The informants described below occupy
both formal and informal positions of leadership in the
communities where they live. Those who are directly
involved with Generasi leverage the program to retain
and fortify their elite status as brokers who deliver
community driven development resources into their
communities. One of the running themes of this report
is to illustrate the difference between “elite control” and
“elite capture” as described by Dasgupta and Beard
in their evaluation of one of PNPM’s early programs in
Indonesia (2007). Whether they are involved directly with
the Generasi program or just volunteers at the posyandu,
the profiles below all illustrate the ways in which village
elites use their status to more effectively deliver benefits
to their communities, which ultimately redounds back to
them in the form of status retention or accumulation.

Bu Haji in Ciperi Village, Ciperi, Sukabumi, West Java

Not unlike many Indonesians, Bu Haji speaks of herself in the
third person. When we arrived at the posyandu in Ciperi’s Middle
Hamlet, Bu Haji explained everything that Bu Haji has contributed
to Generasi’s efforts in Bu Haji’s neighborhood, where Bu Haji is the
ketua RT (the neighborhood head). Bu Haji gave us a complete
tour of Bu Haji’s posyandu and Bu Haji’s nursery school (PAUD) with
infectious enthusiasm and pride.

                                                  After singing songs and other group
                                                  learning activities, Bu Haji makes sure
                                                  these PAUD (nursery school) students
                                                  between the ages of three and five all
                                                  attend the posyandu.


It may seem unusual that a single person assumes figurative
“ownership” of a hamlet’s posyandu and nursery school, but Bu
Haji’s claims on these institutions have a local historical basis.
Before Generasi built the small maternal and child health post
specifically for Middle Hamlet’s posyandu, Bu Haji hosted the
monthly posyandu in her garage. Then she made a charitable
donation of her land (tanah wakaf) immediately next to her house
to the village for Generasi to build the posyandu. The nursery
school room shown in Image 8 is on the other side of Bu Haji’s
house from the posyandu, and the yard just outside the room has a
small playground built with support from PNPM Rural. The nursery
school classes are integrated with the posyandu, ensuring that the
                                                                                   Image 9: The
students who attend can walk over to the posyandu to have their                    Posyandu in
weight and also their height measured every month (infants have                    Middle Hamlet,
                                                                                   Ciperi Village
their body lengths measured as well). Many parents lose interest                   Measures Height
in bringing their kids to posyandu after they have received all their
shots, but the integrated approach ensures that the children in
                                                                                   Out of the five villages surveyed in this
Middle Hamlet continue attending posyandu long after they have                     nutrition research project, only the
completed their immunization schedule. As a crucial indicator for                  posyandu in Ciperi village kept height/
                                                                                   length records of children/infants who
assessing chronic malnutrition, the nutrition research team found it               attend. This photo was taken inside the
remarkable that out of the five villages surveyed for this report, only            posyandu building recently completed
                                                                                   with Generasi support, built on land
the posyandu in Ciperi kept routine statistics on the height/length                donated to the village by Bu Haji
of children/infants.                                                               expressly for the posyandu.



                                                     63
In addition to serving as the de facto leader of the hamlet’s posyandu and nursery
school, Bu Haji holds several other strategic leadership positions in Ciperi. As noted
above, Bu Haji is the head of her neighborhood, but she also leads the Majelis
Taklim women’s prayer group, and the women’s savings and loan (simpan pinjam
perempuan) group sponsored by PNPM Rural. Years ago she was also a fieldworker
for the national family planning program. Before she retired, Bu Haji was a teacher
at a teacher training school, and her husband is retired from the Sukabumi district
Forestry Department.

Bu Haji does not hesitate to use her positions of leadership to persuade (or pressure,
or gently “threaten”) mothers to bring their children to the posyandu, and most
women feel compelled to follow her lead, lest she decide to give them a hard time if
they need her for something else (such as rice subsidies or ID card administration):19
“I tell the mothers who do not bring their children to posyandu, ‘bring your kids to the
posyandu to measure their weight. If you don’t come, then don’t blame or complain
to the volunteers if your children get sick.’” Bu Haji will criticize the parents of children
who are undernourished; she usually asks them questions like “what do you feed your
child at home?” and does not accept excuses from mothers such as “my child doesn’t
want to eat.” She tells these mothers that they must find some way to make their
children eat something. Bu Haji follows active feeding best practices but her skills—
relying upon pressure or compulsion tactics—could use some refinement, including
counseling skills.

In Ciperi there is a homegrown terminology unique to only a few neighboring West
Java districts that refers to the more religious families in the community. They are
called “ASPEK,” derived from the phrase “anti-speaker,” which appears to have its
roots in a local fatwa that forbids mosques from using loudspeakers for the call to
prayer, because there were no speakers during the time of the Prophet Muhammed.20
Aspek colloquially refers to the Muslim families in Ciperi that do not watch television
or use radios, where the women wear black clothes and cover their faces, and live
exclusively amongst themselves. Historically in Ciperi the Aspek families avoid
posyandu because husbands forbid their wives from using family planning and refuse
immunization for their children. Unlike the posyandu volunteers in Pamekasan who
tend to write off such families, Bu Haji uses her position as neighborhood leader and
head of the local Majelis Taklim to personally approach these families.

She goes to their houses and uses a mix of persuasion and pressure to convince them
to participate in posyandu. Bu Haji also uses the Majelis Taklim prayer meetings for
women in Ciperi to conduct outreach on maternal and child health issues. She tells
the other women about the importance of giving birth with a professionally trained

midwife. Bu Haji concedes that most of the women in her prayer group are older
women such as herself, because the young mothers are typically working in one of
Ciperi’s many factories, but these are the ways that Bu Haji makes use of her local
elite status to spread health messages to some of the more obstinate residents in her
community.

Ibu Dian in Dantena Village, Bonde, East Manggarai, NTT

When Ibu Dian graduated from high school she tried attending college in Jakarta
but dropped out after six months and returned home. In 1999, she left her home
village of Dantena again, now with a husband, to live in Surabaya, where she worked
at a shoe factory until 2004, when her husband died from poisoning. When she
returned to Dantena with her son, she actively immersed herself in community
activities, including Hamlet 1’s posyandu. She won second place when the East
Manggarai district health office held a posyandu volunteer contest. When Generasi
began operating in Dantena in 2008, the community elected her to be one of the
KPMD because of her active leadership in the posyandu. She is also the secretary for
Dantena’s PKK women’s organization. For income to support herself and her son, she
works on the administrative staff of a local private Catholic elementary school. They
live with her parents who still manage a large coffee farm (the source of income that
allowed this family to send their kids to college in Java). At age 38, Ibu Dian is now
a candidate for the East Manggarai district assembly representing the newly formed
National Democrat Party (Partai NasDem). The party is backing her campaign, hoping
to harvest votes from the extensive social ties she has gained through her work with
PNPM in Bonde.

Beyond the leadership roles that Ibu Dian has earned and maintained in Dantena,
what the researchers also found refreshing was her matter-of-fact honesty about her
own strengths and weaknesses as a KPMD for Generasi, and as a posyandu volunteer.
She readily admitted that she finds it challenging to ensure maximal participation
at both the PNPM village consultations (musyawarah desa, MD) and the monthly
posyandu (“they come this month to posyandu, but then they are absent the next”),
but that she always tries to encourage attendance. She listed by heart most aspects
of her job description with Generasi and the posyandu, but then also admitted that
she does not fully understand what KEK (chronic energy deficiency) means for women.

Ibu Dian understands the challenges faced by dietary and other cultural norms that
prevail in East Manggarai, such as the inability to serve protein-rich foods because
their livestock is destined for the market or special events. Readily available meat
such as chicken and pork are reserved for special events and guests. “Guests,”
Ibu Dian told us, “are number one, but their own families are number two” when it
comes to preparing healthy foods. “I can’t afford those things, only vegetables,” Ibu
Dian says, imitating a typical mother’s response when she tries to encourage them to
diversify their diet. Babies’ diets are another challenge in Dantena, where mothers are
frequently too busy in their gardens to feed their infants under six months exclusively


                                                   65
with breast milk. When infants are left at home under the care of their grandparents
or older siblings, they feed them bananas, rice porridge, or powdered milk.

Regarding food supplements purchased through the Generasi program, Ibu
Dian lamented the inability to procure local food products because of purchase
requirements (such as a stamped receipt). Instead, Generasi actors must purchase
packaged, imported food such as mung beans (kacang hijau), powered milk, and
formula in Ruteng, the capital of the neighboring district, just over an hour away from
Dantena. This is the largest expense of Generasi’s budget in Dantena.

Ibu Dian’s capacity for critical thinking and leadership appear to be based partly
on her above average level of education and cosmopolitan experiences in Java
compared to Dantena’s ordinary residents, made possible by the income from her
family’s coffee farm. This marks her as a local elite in Dantena, an instance where land
capital transforms into social and cultural capital. The village head, Ibu Dian’s cousin
(they share a grandmother), says that “no one else in the village could replace her.”
Dantena’s posyandu and Generasi programs might not enjoy the limited success that
they have had so far without her. Generasi has reinforced and even increased her
village elite status in the community, propelling her forward and upward to contest
the upcoming district elections.

Pak Mateo in Bena Village, Bonde, East Manggarai, NTT

Out of the three posyandu that we observed in Bonde sub-district in East Manggarai,
perhaps it is not surprising that the best organized and attended posyandu was
hosted in the house of Pak Mateo, one of Bena’s neighborhood leaders (ketua RT),
just as the well-attended posyandu in Middle Hamlet of Ciperi is organized by their
neighborhood leader, Bu Haji. Pak Mateo graduated from high school and hoped to
become a government civil servant but discovered he could not afford the “entrance
fee” (a bribe) required to join, so he became a full-time farmer instead. At age 47, Pak
Mateo has been the ketua RT since the 1990s when Suharto was still president, and
he became one of the posyandu volunteers shortly thereafter. The posyandu that he
hosts at his house covers not just his own neighborhood, but two others that border
his own. The day before each posyandu, he personally reminds the people in his own
neighborhood to attend, and he sends work to the other two ketua RT to remind their
residents as well. If one household persistently does not attend posyandu month
after month, he will personally go to the house to ask why. Typically the answer is
that the parents are too busy working on their farms, or they feel that posyandu is
no longer necessary after they are older than two years of age. But thanks to Pak
Mateo’s efforts, attendance at his posyandu every month remains high.

Even when the assigned health officials do not show up to the posyandu, Pak Mateo
ensures that the posyandu continues, and then he delivers the data register to the
puskesmas: “they [the health staff] usually tell us they’re not coming because they’ve
‘changed the schedule’ at the last moment, but even if they don’t come, the volunteers



                                 66
weigh the kids and I deliver the monthly results to the puskesmas.”21 Nevertheless
he says that only the midwife can diagnose malnutrition: “we just report the kids
who are BGM [under the red line], and then the puskesmas decides who receives
food supplements. However it takes them too long to deliver the food supplements,
no faster than two months.” Likewise, only the health staff can conduct outreach to
the families with young children: “the volunteers rarely do any outreach, that is the
midwife’s job.” The so-called “outreach food supplements” that attract parents to
attend posyandu are given only once in awhile from the puskesmas. They usually
deliver rice, vegetables, eggs, and mung beans, which the volunteers must then
prepare themselves: “I just accept the outreach food supplements for our posyandu,
but if they don’t deliver any then we don’t dare ask any questions, we just accept it.”

Pak Mateo told us, “I have heard of PNPM, but I don’t know what it’s about.” Ibu Yati,
profiled below, knew more about Generasi and explained the frictions between the
Generasi program in Bena and the puskesmas in Bonde.

Ibu Yati in Bena Village, Bonde, East Manggarai, NTT

Ibu Yati is Javanese, from a village near Semarang in Central Java, but has lived
in Bena, her husband’s home village, since they married 20 years ago. They met
through church-related activities when he was studying in Java. One of the first things
she told us about her adjustment to life in Bena was how she absolutely refused the
enormous sida obligations that keep people tied to their extended family networks
through their contributions to extravagant ritual events but also have the effect of
keeping people in an impossible cycle of poverty and debt. For example, in 2012
Pak Mateo (profiled above) had to contribute five million rupiah as his sida obligation
to his brother-in-law. The drawback of refusing to participate in sida obligations is a
kind of excommunication from family networks, but Ibu Yati has found other ways to
integrate with the Bena community. For example, at her own house Ibu Yati hosts a
nursery school (PAUD) similar to Bu Haji’s in Ciperi. The program receives support from
the Department of Education. Her other social contributions recall what she learned
from her mother’s active participation in PKK and the posyandu in her home village in
Java. During the ten years that Ibu Yati has been a volunteer at the posyandu held at
Pak Mateo’s house, she has contributed in many ways that come from following her
mother’s example.

In 2004, Ibu Yati introduced food supplements at the posyandu paid for with voluntary
contributions. Every household would contribute 500 rupiah (about US$0.55 at the
time) each month, and then all the posyandu volunteers and mothers would cook
food together, with instruction on how to prepare nutritious meals. Some of the
menu items, Ibu Yati explained, were based on her posyandu experience in Java, and



21. > We knew, and so did Pak Mateo, that “changing the schedule” at the last minute is nearly impossible because 	
		 the puskesmas sets the posyandu schedule a year in advance and is rarely flexible about changing it in order to 	
		 avoid scheduling conflicts with other puskesmas activities.



                                                                     67
still new to the community when she introduced them in Bena: “Before
then, vegetable soup and mung bean porridge (bubur kacang hijau)
were unknown in this community.” But when the puskesmas began
providing food supplements around 2007, followed by an international
NGO that introduced kitchen gardens (kebun gizi), and then Generasi’s
food supplement program, the neighborhood-initiated program that
Ibu Yati had introduced stopped, and has not been active since then.

Ibu Yati also introduced a rotating credit program (arisan) to the
posyandu, another activity she learned from her mother’s activities in
PKK, as an incentive to attract more parents to attend. Typically, each
participant would contribute 5000 rupiah each month and up to 60
people joined. The program worked from 2004 until 2011. The reason
why the arisan stopped is because typically the first person to receive
the money was the health official who formally managed the posyandu
on behalf of the puskesmas. Since the health staff are frequently
rotating through their positions, they never kept their assignment
with the posyandu in Bena long enough to repay their credit. Then
when another health official was assigned, he or she would again be
the first recipient of the rotating credit. It eventually dawned upon
the increasingly disappointed Bena residents that giving health staff
the honor of receiving credit first was resulting in a net loss for the
community, and the arisan activities, which had been an effective tool
to attract posyandu attendance, ended as well.                             Image 10: Ibu Yati
                                                                           Maintains A Detailed,
Ibu Yati knew much more about the Generasi program than Pak                Organized Posyandu
                                                                           Register
Mateo. One reason Pak Mateo might not know about Generasi, Ibu
Yati hypothesized, is because posyandu volunteers are rarely invited
to attend the Generasi planning meetings, and Generasi actors only
come to posyandu to ask for data. Nevertheless, before Generasi
the puskesmas typically only had enough funds to support three
volunteers for every posyandu, but now Generasi supports a full staff of
five volunteers. The first signs of tension between the puskesmas and
the Generasi program became apparent when Generasi supported the
recruitment of these additional volunteers. Whenever the puskesmas
held training activities for posyandu, only the original volunteers were
invited to attend, and Generasi made up the difference by providing
trainings for only the new volunteers.

“The Generasi program and the puskesmas have never found a
common ground here,” Ibu Yati explained. When Generasi began
providing food supplements, the puskesmas stopped providing
guidance on what menu items to procure and how to prepare them.
Puskesmas staff would tell the posyandu volunteers in Bena “it’s up



                                                   68
to you, those supplements are from PNPM,” which made the volunteers confused
because they have always been told that they are not qualified to make decisions
on what constitutes a nutritional diet for undernourished mothers and children.
“We volunteers don’t know the nutritional standards. That should come from the
nutritionist at the puskesmas.”

In fact, there is very little difference in the types of food provided by the puskesmas
and Generasi. Biscuits, powdered milk, formula, mung beans, vegetables, eggs, and
so on, are the same whether they are procured by the puskesmas or Generasi, but
the difference is that the puskesmas typically provides recipes with measurements,
and Generasi does not. To save their own time, without the guidance of a recipe, the
posyandu volunteers give the raw food supplements directly to the families instead
of preparing it in advance. Ibu Yati concluded that “if the volunteers cook up some
mung bean porridge and the kids do not like it, the parents will just give it to their
pigs.”

Pak Bukhari and Ibu Raihan in Suruan Village, Pandeyan, Pamekasan, East Java

On our first visit to Suruan village, while we waited in front of Ibu Nurhayati’s clinic to
meet her, it was Pak Bukhari and his wife Ibu Raihan who welcomed us enthusiastically
and warmly to the Suruan community and explained the Generasi program that they
manage together. Pak Bukhari is the Generasi PK, and his wife is one of the KPMD.
Ibu Raihan comes from a city in Kalimantan, but she moved to Pamekasan in 1988 to
study at the famous pesantren in Suruan. Three years later, she married Pak Bahri,
who is the son of one of Suruan’s former hamlet leaders. When his father retired in
1996, the Suruan klebun (Madurese: village head) appointed Pak Bahri to replace
him. When a new klebun was elected in 1999, all of the other hamlet leaders either
resigned or were replaced (as is common in Madura, see Case Study #3) but the new
klebun asked Pak Bukhari to stay. The first PNPM program’s (PPK) arrival in Suruan
coincided with the election of another new klebun in 2006. Once again, the new
klebun asked Pak Bukhari to remain as one of the hamlet leaders, while all the others
were replaced, but Pak Bukhari decided to resign in order to become the head of
Suruan’s PPK. Formally, Pak Bukhari was elected, but informally the klebun directed
the community to vote for Pak Bukhari. When the Generasi program was introduced
in 2008, Pak Bukhari once again was elected as PK by acclamation at the village
meeting.22 Pak Bukhari illustrated the paramount importance of village leaders in
rural Madura when he said things like:



           “The process of becoming PK is through village consensus (musyawarah
           desa), but decided by the klebun,”


22. > These local dynamics in which Pak Bukhari is repeatedly nominated for leadership positions (inside and outside of
		 PNPM) “by acclamation” and the determining role of the klebun (and behind the scenes, the kyai) in community-	
		 based decision making processes are specific instances of what David Mosse evocatively calls “facipulation,” or 	
		 manipulative facilitation (Mosse 2008, p. 7).



                                                                      69
        “My election can not be separated from the faith placed in me by the current
        klebun, who has continually given me his trust. The klebun and the entire
        community trust me.”



Ibu Raihan’s leadership role in Suruan rose alongside Pak Bukhari’s. When he first
replaced his father as the hamlet leader, Ibu Raihan automatically assumed leadership
of the hamlet-level PKK group. Even though her husband is no longer the hamlet
leader, she is still active in PKK. She did not expect to get involved with PNPM, but
when the village leadership changed in 2006, one of the village facilitators for the
original PPK program resigned in solidarity with the outgoing klebun. The way Ibu
Raihan recalls the history also illustrates the determining role of the klebun in village
affairs, including PNPM:



        “She is a friend of mine, and she didn’t think it was appropriate to stay on
        as a PPK village facilitator because there was a new klebun. So in the end
        my friend resigned. She is a relative of the former klebun. She asked me to
        replace her, and the new klebun agreed.”



After a year with PPK Ibu Raihan then became KPMD for Generasi.

Although neither Pak Bukhari nor Ibu Raihan had formal schooling beyond elementary
school, out of all the communities we visited, they were by far the most knowledgeable,
practical, and actively involved of all the village level Generasi actors we met during
our fieldwork. At our first meeting, Ibu Raihan quickly listed all of Generasi’s twelve
indicators. For her exemplary efforts over the years, Ibu Raihan was selected to be
one of only two KPMD from Pandeyan sub-district to attend a special KPMD training
in Malang in 2012. Together with the village midwife, Ibu Raihan not only plans
yearly trainings for all the posyandu volunteers on various subjects such as nutrition
and book-keeping, she also attends them. Generasi also supports monthly exercise
classes for pregnant women and occasional child-rearing classes (including cooking
and diet) for mothers with young children, and Ibu Raihan attends all of these events.
Together with the village midwife, she also attends every monthly posyandu in every
one of Suruan’s hamlets (we verified this from multiple respondents). She explains
why: “I’m happy to able to attend the posyandu and learn about the daily lives of
mothers. I also want to know why this child’s development progresses, or why that
child’s development does not.”

On her husband’s political navigation across three village administrations, which is
quite unusual in Madura, Ibu Raihan says Pak Bukhari is the type of guy who can “go
with the flow” (mengikuti arus): “whoever becomes the new klebun, Pak Bukhari
always gets along with him even when the others don’t. He is trusted by all the
klebun. Others resign whenever there is a new klebun, but Pak Bukhari doesn’t join
them. He gets along and is always trusted.”



                                                      70
In many ways, Pak Bukhari is the classic village broker figure (Geertz 1960; James 2011;
Wolf 1956). He not only navigates village politics with ease and takes a leading role
in PNPM projects, he is also a calo, an agent or broker, who helps the other villagers
navigate the government bureaucracy to fulfill ordinary household administrative
obligations to the state, such as procuring identity cards, family or household identity
cards (kartu keluarga), and driver’s licenses. Finally, we also noted that Pak Bukhari
enjoys a close relationship with the kyai who leads the large pesantren in Suruan,
and who, as we noted elsewhere, plays a determining role in village elections (as
hundreds, if not thousands, of his students are registered voters in Suruan, and
the added demographics bring some additional benefits to the community). Pak
Bukhari’s access to the pesantren’s kyai is another form of brokerage that Suruan’s
village leaders value, and hence, one after the other, they each want to keep him in
their political inner circle.

Another reason why Pak Bukhari and Ibu Raihan can be so dedicated to managing so
many details of the Generasi program in Suruan is because they never had children
of their own. They have taken wise counsel (hikmah) from their fate by dedicating
themselves wholesale to village activities. This may be why the residents of Suruan
do not complain about some of the obvious opportunities they might have to benefit
personally (or unethically) from their joint involvement in PNPM. Once in awhile, Ibu
Raihan hears comments from people in Suruan to the effect of “oh it must be nice to
both be involved in a project,” but she sees the positive side, noting that they work well
together, and can help each other to better complete their tasks with information that
they can each cross-check among members of the community. If village “whispers”
(bisik-bisik) and rumors about their outsized roles in Generasi spread, they simply
remind the community that their (s)election (by the klebun) was through the village
consensus process. Pak Bukhari sees the positive as well, and does not admit that
there might be a conflict of interest: “Whenever there is a problem, we just have to
speak with and help one another. For example, if we need a note-taker, I ask my wife
to keep the minutes of our meetings, but in general we each have our tasks, and I
don’t get involved in my wife’s business. She prepares the reports, and I’m involved
with the budgets. I know how to manage the money.” Indeed, for the past few years,
PNPM has asked Pak Bukhari to audit the books for Generasi projects throughout
Pandeyan sub-district.

Conclusions

One of the cornerstones of PNPM is the community decision making process, the
musyawarah desa/dusun, or musdes/musdus, in which Generasi actors are elected
and program goals are decided. But when we asked the Generasi actors profiled
in this case study (among the many others we met) how they came into their roles,
invariably the answers turned upon a nexus of elite social connections in the village.
Ibu Dian is the village head’s cousin and comes from a family of relative means; Pak
Bukhari is the son of a hamlet leader and a close confidante of the Suruan pesantren’s



                                                     71
powerful kyai and successive village leaders. Their quotes (above) point to these
kinds of relationships that brought them into their strategic leadership positions.

Once in these roles, they see their job of organizing musdes and musdus as a numbers
game to maximize attendance. Sometimes Pak Bukhari has to give Suruan villagers
5,000 rupiah in order to ensure their attendance at PNPM planning meetings. But
rarely do the program audits inspect the quality of these consultation sessions.
Instead, Generasi program decisions further rely upon the nexus of village elites, and
in the best cases include committed village midwives such as Ibu Nurhayati in Suruan.
Pak Bukhari told us that one of the most satisfying aspects of working with Generasi
was getting to know Ibu Nur over the years and learning all about the work she
does for maternal and child health in Suruan, a subject he honestly knew very little
about before Generasi. In Suruan, Pak Bukhari and Ibu Raihan closely follow Ibu Nur’s
suggestions, which carry far more weight than musdes or musdus decisions. But
there are more suspect situations, such as when Pak Bukhari was still working for PPK
and the village head named him as the “contractor” for a PPK-supported village road
project. When Ibu Raihan prepares a procurement plan, and then her husband Pak
Bukhari manages the agreed-upon budget to implement the plan, there must surely
be tempting opportunities for conflicts of interest. Likewise, one could ask where the
line between public and private falls in Ciperi when PNPM Rural builds a playground
for Bu Haji’s nursery school, on her own land on one side of her house, and Generasi
builds a posyandu clinic on the other side, but on land that Bu Haji formally donated
to the village but still informally claims as her own.

The point here is not to accuse Pak Bukhari, Ibu Raihan, Bu Haji, or any of the other
formal and informal leaders profiled here of egregious corruption. On the contrary,
the contributions they have made through Generasi (or closely affiliated with it) have
led directly to improvements in maternal and child health services, in some instances
quite dramatically, in their communities. Our fieldwork left us with no doubt, for
example, that when a neighborhood head (ketua RT) such as Pak Mateo or Bu Haji
also hosts the monthly posyandu, the community participation rate will be higher.
These profiles show how various kinds of village elites leverage their leadership
strategically on behalf of their communities in ways that ultimately redound to their
benefit as well, primarily by reinforcing or improving their stature in the community
(and perhaps secondarily through less transparent but minor acts of elite capture).

Case Study #3:

Generasi Accompanies
a Pamekasan Village in
Transition



Immediately upon introducing himself at the start of our interview, Pak Subandi, the
pamong (Madurese: hamlet leader) of one of Badran’s seven hamlets, announced to me
with a sardonic chuckle that “we are right in the middle of the Golden Triangle.”

“What kind of golden triangle? What’s in it?” I asked.

“This is the stronghold of the old klebun (Madurese: village head), who lost the most
recent village election, nearly three years ago, by only three votes.” He went on to
define the three points that draw Badran’s Golden Triangle: in the first corner is the
household of the old klebun, in the second corner there is a small pesantren (Islamic
boarding school) led by a kyai (religious leader) who supported the old klebun, and
in the third corner is the household of Pak Subandi’s predecessor, the former pamong
who also supported the old klebun. Inside the triangle are the old klebun’s supporters,
mostly members of his extended family, and they have persistently and consistently
tried to sabotage all matters of village governance, including PNPM infrastructure and
Generasi health projects, since they lost the election, especially in this hamlet: “The
law of the jungle still prevails here.” Pak Subandi has been an important source of intel
for the new klebun, reporting the concerns and activities in this part of Badran nightly,
either by text message or by clandestine visits to the new klebun’s house after midnight.
Even our visit, as Generasi program researchers, posed a security risk that Badran’s new
regime tried to avoid. So when Badran’s Generasi PK realized that we were determined
to visit posyandu volunteers and ordinary residents in several hamlets and not just the
village leaders, he had to carefully lead us on a circuitous route to Pak Subandi’s house
in order to avoid passing in front of the old klebun’s house. Pak Subandi nodded in
approval when the PK described our route.

As I learned the arcane and sordid details of Badran village’s micropolitics, I was still
skeptical that this dramatized clash between old and new village elites could have
consequential knockdown effects on seemingly innocuous public health programs such
as the posyandu. But as I spoke with Pak Subandi, a second researcher (Nelti) held an
FGD with four of the hamlet’s five posyandu volunteers and learned that when the old
klebun lost the election, all but one of the posyandu volunteers across Badran resigned
en masse, and so did all of the Generasi program actors. These new volunteers are all
distant relatives of the new klebun.

Village elections in Madura typically follow this pattern whenever there is a change in
leadership; mass resignations ensue and the new village administration must recruit
an entirely new staff, without any handover of records and assets. Learning from this


                                                  73
bitter and disruptive turnover in Badran, PNPM staff at the kecamatan level in Pandeyan
published a letter addressed to all village facilitators and leaders urging them, in the
event of a change in leadership, to retain the current facilitators and postpone any
resignations until at least the end of the annual project cycle.

Under the new klebun’s leadership, and with support from Generasi, Badran has increased
the number of posyandu from five to seven (one for each hamlet now), and each one
has a complete staff of five trained volunteers. But all sources in Badran reported that
for at least a year after the village election posyandu attendance dropped precipitously.
While attendance has improved with the promise of food supplements provided at each
posyandu with support from Generasi, attendance in Pak Subandi’s hamlet in particular
remains a problem, confirmed by an inspection of the detailed records maintained by the
village midwife at her public village clinic. Out of more than 50 households with children
under five years of age, only about 20 show up every month to this hamlet’s posyandu.
Some of the families that do not attend are relatives of the former klebun, and when
posyandu volunteers visit their houses to encourage their participation, they refuse with
statements such as “my child doesn’t need to be weighed, he’s healthy!” Other families
would like to attend the posyandu, but they fear retribution from members of the old
klebun’s family if they go. Shortly after the election, one household had their public
water supply pipes cut after they were threatened to avoid the posyandu but attended
anyway. Many people in the community suffer verbal abuse when they try to attend the
posyandu:



        “One of the neighbors once complained to me. She said she was afraid to
        come to the posyandu because when she tried to go previously, members of
        the old klebun’s family would tease and yell at her when she passed by their
        house, shouting ‘Hey! You’re going to the posyandu huh? Don’t you have
        enough to eat at home?’ because they know we provide food supplements at
        the posyandu.”
        — posyandu volunteer in Badran’s “Golden Triangle”


        “They even tease and yell at us whenever we hold a posyandu. They say things
        like: ‘Your kid is already fat! You still have to bring him to posyandu?”
        — posyandu volunteer in Badran’s “Golden Triangle”




In Badran’s “Golden Triangle,” posyandu volunteers do not feel safe monitoring children
with known risks for malnutrition among the non-users in the community. When Nelti
asked if she could visit the nearest home of an undernourished child, the volunteers
appeared nervous: “It’s too risky to go there because the house is surrounded by the
old klebun’s family.” When Nelti persisted, and they went to visit after all, the mother
in this obviously impoverished household verified what the volunteers reported: “we
are afraid of the hostile members of the old klebun’s family.” At three and a half years of


                                     74
age, her son still could not walk, and he had some obvious developmental impairment,
unable to move one side of his body on his own. Her husband did not allow her to have
their son immunized. Isolated from available health services by both her husband and
her “hostile” neighbors, she visits a traditional healer who massages her son’s body.

We discovered that although Badran is clearly going through a harrowing political
transition, our interviews with the new klebun, his wife, the village midwife, the posyandu
volunteers, and the PNPM (Rural & Generasi) facilitators in Pandeyan all confirm that the
new leadership in the community is working hard to earn the support of the old klebun’s
supporters, and this includes a transition in health service awareness and utilization. The
kecamatan facilitators in Pandeyan reported that the new klebun is more serious; he keeps
better records, actively monitors PNPM programs, and attends every planning meeting.
The village midwife has also played an instrumental role in this difficult transition period.
In a good faith effort to increase posyandu participation in all of Badran’s hamlets, the
village midwife accompanied the new klebun’s wife going door to door to encourage
people to attend posyandu. This has included visits to the old klebun’s relatives, who
forthrightly shouted insults at the new klebun’s wife. Remaining above the political fray,
the midwife helps the klebun’s wife to be patient, let the insults drop, and move on to
the next household. The village midwife and the new klebun’s wife both attend every
posyandu. The klebun’s wife works with the volunteers of each posyandu to prepare
the food supplements to be distributed at posyandu, paid for with Generasi funds. The
midwife informs Generasi actors which families require extra food supplements, and
then the klebun’s wife takes care of it with the posyandu volunteers. During months
when Generasi funds are not available for food supplements, the klebun’s wife and the
village midwife pay for it themselves. (Outside the health sector, the new klebun himself
conducts other kinds of outreach to the supporters of his former opponent, outreach that
comes partly out of the late night strategy sessions with Pak Subandi.) In areas such as
the “Golden Triangle” where mothers do not feel safe publicly attending the posyandu,
the midwife reminds them they can attend the posyandu in the neighboring hamlet
instead or make a private visit to her clinic (and some of them do). The new generation
of posyandu volunteers freely admit that they used to give birth with TBAs (still relatively
common in Madura), but in the last two years they are aware of the new “partnership”
arrangement between TBAs and midwives, and recognize the importance of pre-natal
exams and giving birth with the village midwife.

We interviewed the one posyandu volunteer, Ibu Sita, who did not quit after the village
election in Badran three years ago to find out how she survived the pressure to resign.
Ibu Sita is a young, college-educated mother who teaches at the village elementary
school. She is the daughter of a well-to-do Badran business owner and has chosen to
stay in Badran and raise her family there. She believes that her family’s stature and her
higher education protected her from the hostile pressures from the old klebun’s family
that forced all the other volunteers to resign. Ibu Sita claimed no loyalty to either the old
or the new klebun, and insisted that she did not want to know the details of how PNPM
and other village development programs work. “Whether it’s the old or the new klebun,



                                                     75
neither are transparent. We never see any purchase inventories and expenditures for
food supplements.” Nevertheless Ibu Sita confirmed that the PK personally shows up
to every posyandu and gives transport money to the volunteers, and he purchases the
food supplements for the klebun’s wife and the volunteers to prepare and deliver. As
long as the program runs effectively, she does not raise questionable issues such as the
involvement of close members of the klebun’s family running Badran’s Generasi program
(the klebun’s sister is one of the Generasi facilitators, and his brother-in-law is the PK) or
the lack of transparency in program expenditures. As in neighboring Suruan, Ibu Sita
explained that all the posyandu volunteers are empowered to monitor for malnutrition
and high risk pregnancies in their communities and make referrals to the midwife.

Conclusions

A new regime of elites has taken over the administration of Badran, and to deliver
results the new klebun must stick with close members of his family that he trusts to get
things done in the face of so much hostile micropolitical intrigue. Based on our own
observations and Ibu Sita’s relatively neutral assessment, we left Badran with questions
about Generasi actors’ transparency with the Badran community in managing their
budgets.23 PNPM is a crucial tool for the new regime to consolidate their credibility
as leaders in the wake of a highly contentious and hostile election. The results of the
Generasi (and PNPM Rural) program, among other government programs that they
administer, legitimize their status in the eyes of both supporters and former opponents.
While some members of the community may slip through the cracks, such as the isolated
families living in Badran’s “Golden Triangle,” an oft-repeated refrain during our interviews
in Badran were variations on “little by little, awareness is growing.” Broadly speaking,
this refers to growing awareness of what government services can provide to the hamlets
in Badran, as the old regime was characterized as a thuggish group of minor kleptocrats
who never delivered services that inspired confidence in local government. But more
specifically, “awareness is growing” refers to an increasing utilization of health services,
a transition from TBAs to the midwife, and a more active group of posyandu volunteers
who have learned skills to monitor nutrition in their community and refer at-risk cases for
examination. The emphasis on “little by little,” however, remains important given the
spoilers in their midst engaged in active resistance to any efforts that improve the image
of the new regime. Generasi’s outreach does not improve demand and accountability
overnight, but it has assisted and accompanied Badran through its slow and challenging
transition to improved governance.

Conclusions



                 In light of the thematic findings and case study examples,
                 the following conclusions respond to the specific research
                 questions posed at the start of this report.




  RQ 1
                 Given that the social and biological factors that lead toward improved or worsened
                 nutritional outcomes interact in such complex ways at the community level and
                 become manifest in such diversely specific ways at the household level (Dettwyler
                 1993), a brief qualitative study of this nature can only identify factors that present
  Associations
                 clear associations with nutritional outcomes rather than proven causative pathways.
  With
                 The following observations from the thematic findings and case studies stand out:
  Improved or
  Worsened       1.1 Although a more controlled epidemiological study may be warranted, researchers
  Nutrition      found that Generasi’s current system of food supplement procurement and distribution
  Indicators     does not appear to be associated with improved nutritional outcomes, and certainly
                 not to such an extent that justifies the enormous budget allocations for it.

                 1.2 Generasi, by its very active presence in local communities, provides communities
                 with the tools to imagine alternative possibilities of what health services might provide
                 that contrast with the status quo. Compelling evidence from Badran (Case Study
                 #3) and Dantena (Case Study #1) villages suggest that Generasi activities over the
                 years have increased awareness of what communities should expect from their health
                 services, which translates into a slow transformation of demand. This suggests that
                 Generasi might productively refocus some of its programmatic efforts and resources
                 toward advocacy.

                 1.3 An active and engaged midwife that lives in her assigned village full time and
                 treats her clients with dignity and patience may be an unattainable ideal in many
                 cases, especially in regions with limited human resources, but Ibu Nurhayati’s
                 example in Suruan village proves that such figures do exist within the health system,
                 and their contributions ensure that undernourished women and their children do
                 not slip through the social safety net. A full time village midwife also ensures more
                 active management and supervision of posyandu activities with ongoing support
                 and education for the volunteers. When the puskesmas has a full time midwife in
                 the village, health administrators are less likely to be wary of Generasi efforts in
                 these communities. Village midwives have the knowledge, time, skills, and status



                                                   77
to become productive collaborative allies with Generasi actors. Their support and
advice to Generasi actors lends Generasi additional legitimacy in its health activities
on the ground. Villages with neither an active nor present midwife, in contrast, leave
posyandu volunteers without a direct supervisory figure, reduces surveillance capacity
in the villages, and leaves Generasi actors without a direct link for coordinating with
health service providers.

1.4 Strategic community leadership participation in posyandu and other maternal and
child health outreach activities and services indirectly encourages (or softly compels)
wider community service utilization and demand. Each of the case studies illustrates
this clear association in a variety of ways featuring broadly defined networks of formal
and informal village leaders and the positive influence they have in community
utilization of health services.

1.5 This study also highlights how elite practices of strategic control and capture
refer not just to material and monetary resources, but also to information and
knowledge dissemination, which may disempower community and household efforts
to improve health outcomes. It was a bitter irony to discover in Bonde sub-district
that the World Health Organization’s NCHS standard for determining malnutrition
was wielded as an exclusive tool, only at the puskesmas and only when the midwives
had the time to examine the charts (a kind of elite capture of knowledge), sadly
resulting in delayed diagnoses and recriminations between health and Generasi
staff. The puskesmas in Bonde expressed deep aversion to sharing their maternal
and child health knowledge with the posyandu volunteers and other local leaders
in the villages, whereas in Pandeyan the village midwives actively empowered their
posyandu volunteers with maternal and child health knowledge so that they would
be better equipped to conduct informal surveillance in their home communities and
make referrals to the midwife as needed.

1.6 Local conceptions of who is more or less deserving of maternal and child health
services lead to differential access to care and outreach. The maternal mortality
case in Dantena village in 2013 and the death of this woman’s daughter in 2012
were persistently qualified with “…but she had a mental illness,” even by Generasi
actors, suggesting that psychiatric health differentially qualifies individuals and their
families for health services. In Pandeyan, households that subscribed to particular
interpretations of Islamic practice that forbid women and children from accessing
biomedically oriented health services were deemed less deserving of active outreach.
When researchers encountered similar beliefs in Ciperi, local leaders still persisted
with a more persuasive approach whereas in Pandeyan health actors effectively wrote
these households off. Deservingness is a particularly difficult challenge to address
because local understandings about who is more or less qualified to receive care tend
to be based upon a set of shared and naturalized beliefs among local decisionmakers
that include health service providers and Generasi actors.




                                  78
                1.7 Monotonous, protein-poor diets are associated with poor nutritional health
                among mothers and their children. Again Dantena, and to a lesser extent the slightly
                more prosperous Bena villages in Bonde sub-district, with their daily “triangle diet” of
                vegetables boiled in water, poured over rice, featured children with poorer nutritional
                status than the villages surveyed in Ciperi and Pandeyan, which had better access to
                a more diverse supply of affordable and nutritious food, including soy-based protein
                sources such as tofu and tempe. It bears emphasis that Bonde’s monotonous daily diet
                is not strictly a function of poverty, but is also associated with the social organization
                of resource allocation toward outsized family obligations, and local economy that
                emphasizes production of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cloves over
                subsistence farming.

                1.8 Public and household hygiene practices have direct consequences upon maternal
                and child health, including nutritional health. Dantena village, which had minimal
                infrastructural waste maintenance and where every child had an upper respiratory
                infection contrasts strongly against the other four villages that the research team
                visited in this study.




RQ 2
                In the villages, formal and informal leaders, ordinary residents, and even some Generasi
                actors themselves showed limited understanding of the incentivized block grants. In
                fact, this lack of knowledge may illustrate another aspect of elite control of information
                in which Generasi program managers do not adequately share information about how
Effectiveness
                Generasi works. The FK in Suruan village forthrightly explained that while Generasi
of Generasi
                actors in Pandeyan do the work of allocating annual rewards based on achievement
Incentivized
                of target indicators, they do not itemize or promote these bonuses at the village level.
Block Grants
                Whether this exemplifies merely a patronizing attitude toward Generasi beneficiaries
                in the villages or an obfuscation of more sinister efforts at elite capture could not
                be proven with the limited fieldwork conducted by the research team. Suruan was
                arguably the top performing village in this study, whose Generasi actors demonstrated
                impressive mastery over how the entire PNPM program operates. In Suruan, the FK
                made a strategic decision to withhold itemized information about the reward system
                for achieving Generasi targets, but in general, the research team concluded that the
                lack of knowledge about the incentivized block grants is but one symptom of a larger
                issue of proper socialization of policies developed in Jakarta about how Generasi
                works in the villages. Unlike the KPMD in Suruan (the FK’s wife) who understood all
                the mechanics of how Generasi operates, in Bena village the KPMD had a fundamental
                misunderstanding of how the incentive system works, could not recite Generasi’s
                twelve indicators, and had difficulty explaining how Generasi monitors and addresses
                malnutrition. Her lack of knowledge was indicative to researchers of how much more
                work Generasi needs to do in order to ensure the mechanics of the program are
                understood in sensible terms and implemented correctly in the villages.



                                                  79
                                                                                         RQ 3
3.1 One of Generasi’s biggest successes has been the revitalization of village
posyandu, and this includes Generasi’s support for the posyandu volunteers. In
Badran village, for example, prior to Generasi there were only five posyandu to serve
seven hamlets, and each posyandu had only two or three volunteers. After Generasi,
                                                                                         Generasi’s
there are now seven active posyandu, each with a full staff of five routinely trained
                                                                                         Effect on
volunteers. Each posyandu has the equipment it needs such as tables and scales, and
                                                                                         Health
even a loudspeaker to announce posyandu activities throughout the neighborhood
                                                                                         Volunteers
as a way to boost attendance. But even in the more resource-poor villages in Bonde
                                                                                         and Health
sub-district, especially in the absence of full-time health providers in the villages,
                                                                                         Service
Generasi’s support for the posyandu in Dantena and Bena has the less obvious and
                                                                                         Providers
longer term effect of raising awareness in these communities of the services that the
puskesmas in Bonde ought to provide them.

3.2 When a village midwife is present and active in Generasi communities, there
are opportunities for mutually beneficial collaborations between health services
and Generasi. Village midwives manage and supervise posyandu activities, so by
definition Generasi must coordinate with them. In Suruan and Badran villages in
Pandeyan sub-district, each village midwife maintained positive relationships with
Generasi actors, and they actively contributed to Generasi programs, sometimes as
an informal advisor, and sometimes as a co-organizer. It would be hard to conclude
whether Generasi holds these midwives accountable to their communities or inspires
them to be more active, but researchers observed an obvious positive synergy at
work between health services and Generasi activities in these two villages.

3.3 When a village midwife is not present and active in Generasi communities,
there are opportunities for miscommunication and misunderstanding of Generasi’s
activities, leading to resentment or even abdication of responsibilities among health
service providers. This was the major finding from Dantena and Bena villages in
Bonde sub-district, where puskesmas staff thought that Generasi was encroaching
on their turf and lacked proper qualifications to conduct health-related activities in
these villages. The contrast between Pandeyan and Bonde sub-districts convinced
researchers of the importance of having village midwives for Generasi actors to
coordinate with because they act as a crucial link between Generasi activities in the
villages and the health administrators who work at the sub-district puskesmas. When
the puskesmas has a representative of their own in the village, the administrators
may still complain that they do not fully know or understand Generasi’s work in the
villages, but they are reassured that their village midwives probably do instead.

3.4 Generasi has little or no direct effect on the knowledge and practices of TBAs
in the villages where Generasi works, but the findings from this study suggest that
Generasi should view the TBAs as an untapped human resource for future maternal
and child health education and advocacy activities (see Recommendation 3 below).



                                                  80
Recommendations




         The following list of recommendations has been
         developed in light of the thematic findings, case studies,
         and conclusions described above. The recommendations
         are divided into four sections: food supplements,
         posyandu, traditional birth attendants, and advocacy.




         1. Food Supplements

         By far Generasi spends most of its health-related expenses on food supplements,
         and although they certainly do encourage increased posyandu attendance, their
         impact does not seem proportional to their expense. In some cases, such as in Bena
         village, the nutrition researchers observed that food supplements—whether from
         the puskesmas, from Generasi, or a third party NGO—had the unintended effect
         of dampening local initiatives to increase posyandu attendance such as the arisan
         (rotating credit group) and the neighborhood’s own contributions to preparing food
         supplements for the monthly posyandu. The following recommendations may be
         considered with respect to food supplements:

         1.1. Put limits on the food supplement line items in Generasi’s health-related budgets.
         Savings may be allocated for other activities such as advocacy and increased support
         for posyandu volunteers or TBAs (see below), while a more limited budget for food
         supplements may prioritize treatment for acute cases of malnutrition (see 1.4 below)
         instead of the low-impact “outreach” supplements used for the posyandu.

         1.2. The quality of food supplements could be improved by requiring Generasi to
         purchase from local vendors of fresh food instead of packaged products from the cities.
         Most sub-district and village level facilitators choose the simplicity of bulk purchasing
         milk and biscuits, in some cases enough for an entire fiscal year. Generasi actors claim
         this is not only easier, but also meets accountability and audit requirements because
         urban vendors have the tools to submit tender proposals, provide stamped receipts,
         and so on. But the nutrition researchers saw that this method of procurement also
         offers opportunities for easily disguised forms of elite capture of cash resources,


                                           81
whether by midwives who receive commission for recommending particular brands
of milk for Generasi to purchase24 or by Generasi actors themselves who may collude
with urban vendors.

1.3. A transparent mechanism needs to be devised that enables purchase of local
food products from within rural farming communities, but that also meets Generasi’s
accountability and audit requirements. In Pamekasan and Sukabumi, Generasi actors
appeared to be purchasing at least some of their food supplements such as eggs and
vegetables from local suppliers, but the PKs were not forthcoming with information
about their procurement procedures for these local products. The tradeoff from this
lack of transparency in Pamekasan was the facilitators’ assertions that the village head
would pay for posyandu supplements out of his own pocket if Generasi funds were
not enough to cover the expenses, but this informality does not scale up.

1.4. A flexible mechanism needs to be in place for rapid treatment of identified
cases of acute malnutrition with food supplements. In Bonde, the puskesmas was
not following up in a timely manner when potential malnutrition cases were identified
by the posyandu volunteers. In one village (Bena), Generasi actors tried filling this
gap by providing food supplements, but to the chagrin of the puskesmas, while
the other village (Dantena) waited for the puskesmas to make their diagnosis. But
even in Bena, Generasi actors were constrained by budget cycles and procurement
procedures that did not allow for the rapid procurement of food supplements when
they were needed. If Generasi actors had more flexibility to rapidly procure local
sources of food supplements for acute cases, then they might also be able to more
actively ensure that parents are using it to feed their children (instead of giving it to
their pigs, as Ibu Yati warned) on a daily basis, instead of dropping off bulk items of
milk and biscuits several weeks after cases have been identified.




2. Posyandu

The posyandu remains a village-level institution with great potential, but researchers
observed radically inconsistent variations in its implementation across the five
surveyed villages in this study. Generasi can support the continuation of posyandu and
its development with more than just food supplements. Generasi already supports
minimal incentives for the posyandu volunteers, and in many villages also provides
additional training for them. In short, the findings of this research recommend an
increase in both, while also taking advantage of the posyandu as a village-based
institution for disseminating health messages to parents with young children. 		
	


24. > The fairly recent ban on midwives marketing baby formula to mothers with infants under six months of age
		 appears to have encouraged the marketing of other milk formulas specially designed for pregnant women and
		 children over six months of age. Many Generasi communities readily take up these marketing suggestions and
		 purchase them.




                                           82
2.1. Generasi has partly revitalized posyandu by providing incentives to the
volunteers, thus ensuring a complete staff of five volunteers for every posyandu.
Volunteer incentives should be increased in exchange for performance accountability.
Some examples: many midwives, Generasi actors, and posyandu volunteers
complained that few among them had the time, interest, or knowledge to prepare
nutritious food supplements for the monthly posyandu. With an increased incentive
to participate, volunteers may be asked to spend time preparing fresh food the night
before or the morning of each monthly posyandu. The examples from Suruan and
Badran show that when the village midwife actively includes the volunteers in the
compilation and analysis of posyandu data, and empowers the volunteers to identify
risk cases for referral, the volunteers then share a greater sense of ownership in their
posyandu. Increased incentives may be tied to these reflective and analytical tasks at
the end of each posyandu event. In short, as volunteer capacity improves (see next
recommendation 2.2), so should their incentives.

2.2. Generasi supports routine training for posyandu, and this could be increased.
For many parents, the posyandu volunteers are their first contact with public maternal
and child health services. Instead of being told by health professionals (as in Bonde)
that they are not capable of performing anything but the mechanical functions of
the monthly posyandu, the volunteers should be trained and empowered to identify
signs of malnutrition, infections, pregnancy risks, and even mental health disorders
for referral to trained health professionals. Pamekasan provided many excellent
examples of how the volunteers receive routine training and work collaboratively
with the village midwife. An important caveat: Generasi should take care not to
simply replicate (or worse, replace) the posyandu volunteer training curriculum
already established by the puskesmas. While Generasi’s advocacy activities should
ensure that the puskesmas fulfills its obligations to correctly and completely train
their posyandu volunteers without cutting corners (see 4.1 below), Generasi may
supplement the puskesmas training with particular skills not already covered by the
puskesmas curriculum.

2.3. Related to recommendation 2.2 immediately above, but important enough to
stand alone on its own, wherever Generasi operates, posyandu volunteers must be
trained and required to measure the lengths of infants and the heights of toddlers
and young children under five.25 This requires inexpensive inputs such as tape
measures and measuring sticks (preferably against a wall), and one or two training
and practice sessions that includes how to measure lengths and heights, and how
to modify the registers to include this data. Some health professionals, such as the
midwife Ibu Nancy in Bonde, argued that measuring length/height is not yet part
of the puskesmas standard operating procedure, and they may only do this once a
year for the annual village health survey, but researchers observed that the posyandu
volunteers in Ciperi, Sukabumi could easily integrate length and height measurement
into their monthly routine (see Image #9). These measures provide the raw data for


25. > Additional training on how to correctly and consistently measure weight, as well as how to calibrate hanging scales 	
		 and floor scales would improve posyandu data validity across Indonesia.

                                                                        83
monitoring stunting in Indonesia. A critical mass of Generasi communities integrating
length and height measures into posyandu will be an invaluable advocacy tool for
bringing about changes in standard posyandu operating procedures more quickly.
This recommendation may require modifying the Generasi health indicators to
include stunting.

2.4. As a front-line maternal and child health service in villages, posyandu has the
potential, with support from Generasi, to provide more effective monthly outreach
to parents. In Suruan, for example, Generasi supported activities for parents such
as cooking classes for mothers and aerobic exercise for pregnant women. But these
activities were not integrated with the posyandu. Generasi could simultaneously
promote posyandu as a desirable and visible village institution and save money
on expenses such as nutritious snacks (instead of providing them twice at separate
events) by conducting these training activities at the posyandu.

2.5. In order to reduce dependency on Generasi (or the puskesmas) to provide
“outreach” food supplements, or snacks, at the monthly posyandu, Generasi should
advocate for and empower neighborhood associations to assume responsibility for
their own posyandu “outreach” food supplements and other incentives such as arisan
activities to improve participation rates.




3. Traditional Birth Attendants

As with the posyandu, Generasi should not overlook the role and untapped potential
of TBAs (dukun beranak) in the villages. Researchers found that many mothers,
especially at the social margins or at great distances from professional health services,
are still using TBA services throughout the entire pre- and post-natal childbearing
cycle. TBAs have more time to attend to these women than health professionals, so
it is important that TBAs have training in the best practices of village-based maternal
and child health care and referral. Many puskesmas have already implemented
partnership agreements with village TBAs, but these are based on a narrow and
vertically directed interpretation of guidelines set forth by MoH focused strictly
on ensuring that TBAs refer women to midwives for childbirth. Given that these
guidelines actually acknowledge and specify a more broadly inclusive and equitable
role for TBAs across the childbearing cycle, Generasi has an existing model,
consistent with national health policy, to develop and advocate for a redefinition of
these partnerships. Some recommendations include the following:

3.1 TBAs should not be exempt from the kinds of trainings that Generasi supports for
posyandu volunteers. Many TBAs already have the experience and intuition to know
what constitutes best practices for maternal and child health and nutrition, while
some could use a persuasive correction of various practices that may complicate the
health of mothers and their infants.



                                  84
3.2 Generasi should develop and advocate for more inclusive and equitable
midwife-TBA partnership agreements based on MoH national guidelines. The MoH
guidelines distinguish between the technical role of the midwives and the non-
technical contributions of the TBAs that educate and empower mothers and local
communities such as:

           a. Empowering women, their families, and the entire community on
           maternal and child health issues.

           b. Highlighting local traditions that empower and reinforce best
           practices in maternal and child health.

           c. Discouraging traditional practices that may lead to pregnancy,
           childbirth, and childrearing risks and complications.26



In promoting more equitable partnerships with TBAs, the MoH guidelines mention
inviting TBAs to sit in and observe midwives at their clinics and providing financial
incentives, contingent upon monitoring and evaluation activities that ensure TBAs
adhere to best practices.27

Based on these general MoH guidelines, Generasi might consider some of the
following suggestions. For example, if Generasi actors and posyandu volunteers
are too busy to routinely check in on mothers or to prepare and deliver fresh
food supplements to undernourished mothers and their children, for a minimal
investment the TBAs can be trained and incentivized to do these monitoring and
outreach activities as informal community health workers. As trusted members of
the local community, TBAs are ideally situated to monitor, identify, and refer high risk
pregnancies and undernourished mothers and children for medical diagnosis. TBAs
can also encourage and teach mothers to improve nutrition in their household diet
and promote exclusive breastfeeding. TBAs should be rewarded for upgrading the
skills that they already employ, and that mothers already solicit.

3.3 Existing partnership agreements currently focus exclusively on how to ensure
that “bandel“ TBAs no longer deliver infants on their own rather than how TBAs
may be recruited as a community resource to support and ensure optimal maternal
and child health. Generasi should strictly avoid supporting so-called partnership
agreements that employ scare tactics and punitive approaches that stigmatize and
further marginalize the TBAs as an enduring village institution. This disciplinary
approach to sidelining TBAs from maternal and child health care comes out of a
patronizing attitude toward these women who are invariably seen as backward pillars



26. > These recommendations are summarized from page 8 of the MoH document cited in footnote 6 above.
27. > pp.14-15 in the MoH guidelines cited in footnote 6. In the partnership agreements that researchers learned about 	
		 during fieldwork, TBAs were indeed invited to participate in the non-technical aspects of childbirth at the clinic 	
		 and were given a small incentive (never more than $5), typically drawn from the national childbirth insurance 		
		 scheme for midwives (jampersal).



                                                                      85
of pre-modern Indonesian society, without conducting a thoughtful inventory of the
knowledge and practices of TBAs, nor examining the social and economic reasons
why women still solicit TBAs for their services. If MoH in Jakarta has developed a less
judgmental understanding of the role of TBAs in local communities, then Generasi
should not only avoid supporting regulations that reinforce stigma, but also actively
advocate for the destigmatization of TBAs so that MoH’s more inclusive approach to
midwife-TBA partnerships described above might someday be realized in practice.




4. Advocacy

During a recap of our visit to East Manggarai with a team of Generasi actors, the
district facilitator wondered aloud whether Generasi might benefit from spending
its budget on activities such as networking, lobbying, or advocacy that might
stimulate community-led initiatives for better health services. The list of advocacy
recommendations here reflect upon his suggestion, and they may be possible
financially if Generasi places limits on budget allocations for food supplements.

4.1 In some communities such as Bonde, Generasi should avoid doubling or replacing
training activities that fall under the puskesmas’ purview and instead advocate
and support the puskesmas to conduct these activities in full and for all intended
stakeholders. For example, Generasi relied upon the puskesmas’ three-day basic
training curriculum for posyandu volunteers. The puskesmas conducts this training
annually, but it only lasts one day, whereas when Generasi conducts the same training,
the volunteers attend a full three-day event. Rather than conduct the training twice,
Generasi might instead advocate for the puskesmas to do it once, in full, perhaps with
a little extra support to ensure that all volunteers can attend for all three days.

4.2 Similarly, Generasi should transition away from providing “outreach” food
supplements at the posyandu because this too falls under the purview of the
puskesmas. Instead, Generasi could conduct advocacy work to ensure that the
puskesmas demands and receives a budget for posyandu food supplements from
the district health office and then correctly administers it.

4.3 For a program that prioritizes health, Generasi does not have many health experts
working at the district and sub-district levels. This reduces Generasi’s bargaining
power with health service providers. Trained health professionals make it clear in
both subtle and direct ways that Generasi actors are unqualified to implement and
monitor health-related activities in the villages. Generasi might consider hiring
district-level and/or provincial level facilitators with recognized health credentials in
order to conduct more convincing advocacy work with health service providers.

4.4 Following upon 4.3, the general lack of expertise on health issues within
Generasi means that sub-district and village level actors have radically inconsistent
levels of health knowledge that depend on prior education and self-initiative rather


                                  86
than a uniform Generasi standard. Compare Ibu Raihan, the KPMD in Suruan, with one
of the KPMD the researchers interviewed in Bena. Ibu Raihan attends every training
and every posyandu, and has all the health indicators memorized, but the Bena KPMD
could not even give her interviewers a consistent understanding of the warning signs
for malnutrition, nor could she list any of the Generasi indicators. All Generasi actors
should be required to confidently appraise the risks and symptoms of undernutrition and
understand the tools at Generasi’s disposal to address malnutrition in their communities.
As with recommendation 2.1 to reward posyandu volunteers for increased capacity,
so too should Generasi reward KPMD mastery of the health concepts and program
mechanics that are essential for effective village facilitation.28

4.5 Generasi’s sub-district and district facilitators should more explicitly conduct outreach
activities in the villages to inform families about health policies and services that meet
their needs such as the national (and/or regional) health insurance schemes (jamkesmas
and/or jamkesda) and the pregnancy and childbirth health insurance scheme (jampersal).
Apart from health insurance schemes, Generasi can also more proactively inform local
communities about what they should expect from their puskesmas, their village midwife,
and their neighborhood posyandu, and then provide the tools and support for seeking
redress when these expectations are not met.

4.6 In some communities, women and men are actively involved in managing and
attending the posyandu, while in others these activities are dominated almost exclusively
by women. Whether the health domain and the posyandu in particular are dominated
by women or not, Generasi should conduct active family health outreach to men in the
villages, particularly fathers, because in many communities (such as in Pamekasan) all
household decisions, including for health care, require the permission of men even when
they are ultimately carried out by women.

4.7 Bearing in mind the insights on strategic leadership described in Case Study #2,
Generasi might consider identifying and then supporting some of the formal and informal
leaders in the villages such as Bu Haji, Pak Mateo, and Bu Yati, who show potential to
become maternal and child health “spokespersons” in their communities. Generasi may
creatively pursue options to leverage the status of local leaders in the community that
benefits both the community and the chosen spokespersons.

4.8 As many of these advocacy recommendations may be outside of the scope of
program’s core mandate, Generasi should explore outsourcing advocacy work to local
civil society organizations concerned with health and governance issues. This advocacy
work may be shared with existing institutions such PKK, a women’s group in every village
led by the village head’s wife that is technically a stakeholder in the implementation of
posyandu activities but in general has historically left posyandu in the hands of the health
sector. A model for outsourcing advocacy work to local NGOs is currently underway in
Lombok Barat where Generasi is working together with the ACCESS program.


28. > Recommendations 2.1 and 4.4 point to a more general need to creatively think of ways to conditionalize the perfor	
		 mance of Generasi actors at the village level.

                                                                                Detailed Research
                                                                                        Questions


Contextual Topics

1.	 Political Economy: District-level elections have effects on the type of pro-poor
    health policies enacted. Example: District governments that rely on populist
    campaign messages may respond more actively in office to the needs of poor
    constituents (Rosser & Wilson 2012).

2.	 Presence of other nutrition programs: NTT is well-known for the abundance of
    nutrition improvement programs promoted by international agencies, NGOs,
    and government health initiatives. To what extent do chronic malnutrition
    indicators benefit from the presence of these programs (concurrent with PNPM
    Generasi) at the village level?

3.	 JamKesMas & JamPersal: Related to the previous question, to what extent
    do decentralized health insurance policies (JamKesMas, jaminan kesehatan
    masyarakat), including new forms of pregnancy and delivery insurance
    programs (JamPersal, jaminan persalinan) lead to a differential impact on
    chronic malnutrition status?

4.	 Poverty and Malnutrition: Much of the anthropological and social
    epidemiology literature on malnutrition report that poverty is rarely the
    primary cause of malnutrition (e.g. Dettwyler 1993). To what extent are these
    conditions correlated in NTT and Java? Are BCC messages only targeted
    toward particular socio-economic groups, and if so, is that a bias?

5.	 Double burden of malnutrition: To what extent does our research detect
    the double burden of malnutrition (i.e. the co-existence of overweight and
    underweight) in Generasi communities? Are communities and service providers
    aware of this issue?

Supply-side Topics (health services)

6.	 Health bureaucracy and administration: How are health policies and services
    coordinated between district, sub-district, and village levels? Are sub-district
    clinic staff conducting routine outreach and surveillance in the villages?
    What data collection methods are employed at each level and what are their
    indicators? Do specialists in nutrition, hygiene, midwifery, and nursing work
    with PNPM facilitators? Do these specialists keep tight controls over their
    program information?




                                                   92
7.	 Behavioral Change Communication (BCC): How do targeted BCC messages
    vary across Generasi villages, and are there differential effects? What role do
    the promkes officers play?

8.	 Supplementary feeding (PMT Pemberian Makanan Tambahan): Does the use
    of supplementary feeding or MMN (Multiple Micro-Nutrient supplements),
    either for urgent cases (PMT pemulihan) or longer term care (PMT penyuluhan)
    make a difference in the chronic malnutrition indicators. In particular, do
    pregnant women use these supplements (food or MMN) and then as a result
    give birth to healthier babies at less risk for stunting? What role did PNPM
    Generasi play in the selection and procurement of PMT or MMN?

9.	 Surveillance improvements: Did Generasi have an impact on local community
    and service provider capacity to improve surveillance and detection of
    malnutrition? Could such improvements account for the increase in chronic
    malnutrition indicators?

10.	 Village midwives and posyandu volunteers: How does front line service
     delivery work in the villages?

PNPM Generasi

11.	 PNPM Generasi Bureaucracy and Administration: How do PNPM Generasi
     staff coordinate at district, sub-district, and village levels? Are village
     facilitators conducting routine outreach and surveillance in their communities?
     What data collection methods do PNPM facilitators employ at each level and
     what are their indicators? Do PNPM facilitators coordinate and work with
     health specialists in nutrition, hygiene, midwifery, and nursing?

12.	 PNPM Generasi’s Menu of Options: Each Generasi village may choose
     from a menu of options most appropriate for their communities. What
     gets implemented and how? Are some villages choosing options that have
     differential effect on nutritional status? For example, if a disproportionate
     number of Generasi villages in Java focused exclusively on education items on
     the PNPM menu, might these education benefits come at a cost to nutritional
     status? Note: how much can we learn about this in advance from the MIS
     data?




                                                   93
13.	 PNPM Facilitator Dynamics: How involved are local facilitators in assisting
     Generasi villages to make informed decisions about how to choose the most
     appropriate programs? Do facilitators know how to develop awareness of the
     needs of the most vulnerable in their communities? Do facilitators provide
     enough information (about the types, risks, and presentation of malnutrition for
     example) to help Generasi villages make informed decisions? Do facilitators
     map out and explain local service capacities in order that communities will make
     decisions that reflect the greatest service needs?

14.	 Generasi Beneficiary Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: How do Generasi villages,
     together with their PNPM facilitators, set the parameters for defining the
     target beneficiaries of their selected programs? How do the Generasi villages
     and their PNPM facilitators perceive and enact the distribution and equity of
     resources in their own communities. Local Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices
     (KAP)

15.	 Community and household sanitatation/hygiene: Observational indicators such
     as presence of soap, open defecation (rivers, behind houses), well-constructed
     gutters (saluran) to carry waste away from houses, presence of acute respiratory
     infections, children with bare feet and/or runny noses, access to household or
     village MCK facilities, etc. Will also pursue personal knowledge of best hygiene
     practices during interviews.

16.	 Household Diets: How have families’ knowledge, attitude, and practice of
     household diets changed since the introduction of Generasi into their village?
     Particular issues to focus on include exclusive breastfeeding to infants up to six
     months, the diversification of dietary intake for children between six and twenty-
     four months, and mother’s diet both during and after her pregnancy.

17.	 Community Perceptions & Taboos: What perceptions and taboos related to
     food and MCH do respondents report in Generasi communities, and have these
     changed at all since the introduction of the program?
