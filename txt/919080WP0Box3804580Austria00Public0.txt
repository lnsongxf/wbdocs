THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

Austria is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                  Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       A form (NeuFö2), which is available electronically on the homepage of
       the Austrian Ministry of Finance must be filled in and be confirmed by
       the Economic Chamber. The Neufö applies to the company formation
       and to the transfer of businesses.

       Procedure 1 is optional but it can lead to exemption from paying
       certain publicly levied fees and taxes. If certain requirements are met,
       the following fees and taxes will be waived:
       • Stamp duties and certain administrative fees.
       • Real estate transfer tax.

       • Capital transaction tax (1% of nominal capital).
       • For 1 year, certain ancillary wage costs borne by the employer in
       addition to social security contributions.

       Depending on the requested exemptions, companies must obtain
       confirmation by certain public bodies (Chamber of Commerce or Social
       Security Organization) that the application form has been completed,
       after receiving counseling by that body concerning the scope and
       applicability of the law.

      The commercial register automatically informs tax authorities of the
      registration of new companies. In turn, tax authorities usually respond
      by requesting that the company file for tax registration. One of the
      following forms must be filed with the tax authority: Form 15, or 24
      (available at www.bmf.gv.at/), and the articles of association, the
      opening balance sheet, an excerpt of the company register, an
      identification card of a managing director, a specimen signature sheet
      of the representatives must be filed as attachments. The authority             12 days            no charge

      issues the tax number within 10 to 14 days. The VAT number is usually
      issued simultaneously with the tax identification number. The statutory
      deadline to obtain a tax number is 1 month. Frequently tax authorities
      extend a “welcome visit” to those companies intending to engage in
      business activities that are eligible for the filing of VAT returns.

        An external site inspection is necessary. The waiting time is usually a few
        days. Someone from the customer’s party has to be present.                    9 calendar days         EUR 0

        installation from the network operator Wien Energie Stromnetz GmbH in
   3    order to get an electricity connection (“Fertigstellungsanzeige”). The        3 calendar days        EUR 24

        Obtain external connection works and meter installation from Wien
        Energie Stromnetz GmbH

        The external works start immediately after signature of the contract. Only
        the utility is in charge of the works. The utility is providing all the
        material. A new transformer would have to be built on the private
        ground of the customer. The meter gets installed at the same time. The
        utility installs the meter and is the owner of it. Electricity starts flowing
        immediately if a contract with a supplier of electricity has been signed.
        The connection fees in Austria are composed of two parts: 1) Fee for
        accessing the net ("Netzzutrittsentgelt") which includes all costs such as
        labor and material cost. The utility is usually having as standard            6 calendar days       EUR 37,233.4
   4
        transformers of 360kVA. In the case of a 140kVA connection, the
        customer would pay about half of the transformer and the remaining
        capacity would be used by other customers. 2) Fee for using the net
        ("Netzbereitstellungsentgelt" at Netzebene 6). With a power connection
        of 140kVA, the customer is automatically on Level 6, meaning the
        customer owns the connection to the transformer and is directly
        connected to the low tension side of the transformer. There are meter
        installation costs.

        Agency: Wiener Netze GmbH



        * Sign supply contract with Wienstrom

        Electricity starts flowing only if a contract with a supplier of electricity has
        been signed. Wien Energie Stromnetz GmbH is a daughter company of
        Wien Energie GmbH, as well as the energy supplier Wienstrom. The
        application for connection is submitted with Wien Energie Stromnetz
        GmbH, however only Wienstrom is supplying electricity. Therefore, the            2 calendar days        EUR 0
   5
        customer needs to conclude a contract with Wienstrom for the supply of
        energy. The supply contract can be concluded already before the
        external connection works are finished.

       At the notaries office the parties can combine three steps:

       1. The signatures of seller and buyer have to be authenticated on the
       contract. That can be done by notary or by court (time to complete: can
       be done within 30 minutes, if required, normally 1 day; cost: EUR 134.90

       signing representatives has to be proven. At the notaries office that is

      3. The parties have to pay Property Acquisition Tax or Transfer Tax
      (Grunderwerbssteuer) which, in this case, amounts to 3.5 % of the
      purchase price. They have to present to the Land Register a clearance
      certificate (Unbedenklichkeitsbescheinigung) furnished by the tax
      authorities certifying that the tax was paid (time to complete: tax
      assessment will last about 4 weeks; to get the certificate after paying the
      tax further 2 weeks; no extra costs). This clearance certificate may be
      substituted by a self-assessment declaration
      (Selbstbemessungserklärung) filed by a notary or a lawyer (attorney at
      law/solicitor) if the tax is paid to the notary or lawyer who cooperates
      with the tax authorities. The notary public or the attorney-at-law usually
      issues the clearance certificate stating that the real estate transfer tax
      (3.5% of the purchase price) and registration fee for the Land Register
      (1.1% of the purchase price) have been paid. The registration fee for the
      Land Register rises from 1% to 1.1 % of the purchase price due to the
      regulation Federal Law Gazetta BGBI I Nr 111/2010 and is effective as of
      January 01, 2011. The certificate will be issued immediately after the
      notary or lawyer has received the amount of the real estate transfer tax
      and registration fee. The money for the purchase and the taxes is given
      to the notary/lawyer on a trust account. The parties may set up the
      contract themselves or use a standard template. In late 2005, the Act
      concerning “Changes in the vocational law of notary publics, attorneys-
      at-law and civil engineers” was announced, providing for the use of
      electronic signatures which are to be submitted electronically to the
      courts. This Act has therefore created the legal basis for online
      registration and electronic notarial attestation. This reform is effective as
      of July 1, 2007.
