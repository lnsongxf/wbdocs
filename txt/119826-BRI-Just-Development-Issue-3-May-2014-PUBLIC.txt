      An Introduction to Selecting the Right Indicators to Improve

      areas that are working well (and thus could be                      judges, court personnel, lawyers and court user

      derstand whether resources are achieving desired                    to think about measuring performance in at least
      impacts. Measuring performance can also help to                     the following five areas: 1. Efficiency; 2. Quality; 3.
      create a compelling evidence base for courts to                     Transparency and Accountability; 4. Access; and
      make budget submissions for future resources.                       5. Independence. These measurement areas, of
      Aligning Interests, Incentives and Influence:                       course, are very much interrelated. For example,

     The process of developing court indicators can fall roughly into three phases: (1) developing the right
     measures, (2) ensuring the right delivery of the information, and (3) enabling the right use of the measures.
     Phase 1: Develop the Right Measures
     Q: Are there generally accepted measures of court performance?
     A: Yes, more or less. There are three tried and tested models of performance measures listed in the table
     below. These models, or the measures within them, will not be relevant or useful for every context. Use of
     these models for any reform process could range from simply consideration (“inspiration”), to adaptation or
     direct adoption. The process of determining whether to consider, adapt or adopt should be grounded in local
     priorities, the nature of the reforms being undertaken and capacity to collect the relevant data.
