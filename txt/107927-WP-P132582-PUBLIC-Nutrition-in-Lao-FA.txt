EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.	     Undernutrition levels in Lao PDR remain among the highest in the world, despite
both rapid economic growth and a significant decline in poverty over the past years.
Concerns about the slow progress in reducing undernutrition have triggered intense policy
discussion and several analytical reports have been produced over the last few years on
the Lao PDR nutrition crisis and its drivers. This report adds to this knowledge base and
better informs the broad discussion by using evidence grounded in rigorous analysis us-
ing Lao PDR data, to identify constraints specific to the country rather than relying only
on international or descriptive evidence. In particular, multivariate analysis is used to pull
together all the determinants of stunting using more complete data, which controls for the
correlation between interrelated determinants of undernutrition, thus helps identify the
most important determinants in Lao PDR. This sets apart this analysis from previous work
which has mainly relied on univariate and descriptive analysis. Furthermore, new evidence
from an analysis of a recent survey of health facilities and health workers, and a qualita-
tive-based rapid assessment of nutrition counseling and growth monitoring conducted in
Lao PDR is brought in to highlight specific gaps in skills and behaviors of health workers in
delivering nutrition counseling and growth monitoring. This combination of qualitative and
comprehensive quantitative analysis is a novel approach in Lao PDR and brings up useful
insights and call for action.

Key Findings
2.	     The causes of undernutrition in Lao PDR are multi-faceted and multi-sectoral.
They range from factors that are determined before the child is born - such as mother’s
stature, education, health, care, diet and age during pregnancy - to factors affecting the
child after birth, like inadequate breastfeeding as well as low macro- and micronutrient
intake due to low dietary diversity, and poor hygiene and sanitary environment, especially
open defecation. Most factors are influenced by the lack of appropriate knowledge as well
as social, gender, and cultural norms and practices. The main insights from the analysis are
highlighted below:

3.	     While food insecurity is widely assumed to be a major determinant of stunting in
Lao PDR, our analyses show that access to food is less of a concern, but rather the poor
quality of the diet is the main source of inadequate nutrient intake in children. Analysis
of the LECS 5 shows that a typical household in Lao PDR has sufficient access to food to
cover their required calorie intake. However, diversity in diet is low, with rural households
consuming an average of 3 out of 9 major food groups. Poor feeding practices for infants
and young children compound this problem, as children under 2 year old are less likely to be
fed certain important food groups even when they are available in the household. We find
for example that 6-23 months old children are not fed vitamin A rich vegetables even when
their mothers consume them. However, no such intra-household gaps are observed for 24-
59 months old children, pointing to sub-optimal infant and young child feeding practices
among the 6-23 months old children.

    4.	     Due to poor infant and young child feeding practices, an increase in agriculture di-
    versity alone, as usually recommended, may have little impact on child dietary intak. The
    analysis finds a positive correlation between agriculture diversity and household dietary
    diversity, but no correlation with individual child dietary diversity and stunting is found.
    This again highlights that poor feeding practices are a weak link between access to food
    and adequate diet for infant and young children since children are not fed important food
    items that households have access to already.

    5.	     Intergenerational factors, driven by social and gender norms, are shown to have a
    substantial influence on undernutrition. Children born to young girls, to mothers with less
    than complete primary education and to mothers who are themselves stunted, are much
    more likely to be stunted. The likelihood of being stunted is at least 10 percentage points
    higher among children conceived by women below the age of 17. As nearly all teenage preg-
    nancies are a result of early marriages and mostly prevalent among less educated girls,
    this finding highlights how gender and cultural norms impact child undernutrition.

    6.	     Multivariate analysis suggests that tropical/environmental enteropathy - a sub-
    clinical disorder of the small intestine - is the channel through which poor sanitation and
    hygiene affects stunting. High chronic exposure to large quantities of fecal bacteria results
    in anatomical changes to the structure of the small intestine which affects a child’s ability
    to both absorb and utilize nutrients. Estimates show that the probability of stunting among
    6 – 23 months old children is 14 percentage points higher when the share of the population
    practicing open defecation in the village increases from 25 percent to 100 percent, but no
    correlation is found between incidence of diarrhea and stunting.

    7.	      On the supply side, the analysis reveals significant gaps in skills and behaviors
    around nutrition counseling, indicating how the health service delivery system is inad-
    equately prepared to perform core nutrition related interventions. Nationally, 67 percent
    of health center staff have not received training on nutrition, yet 87 percent of staff had
    provided these services in the three months prior to the survey. This was confirmed dur-
    ing focus group discussions with health workers which revealed their lack of confidence in
    providing nutrition counseling (i.e. growth promotion) and the majority reported not having
    received any training on nutrition counseling. Health centers have the primary responsibil-
    ity for identification of children who are – or are at risk of becoming undernourished, as well
    as the health sector’s nutrition response, but they lack sufficient tools, nutrition supplies,
    and human resources to provide an adequate diagnosis and response. Only 66 percent of
    health centers surveyed had the equipment to measure weight and height in children.

8.	      Poor knowledge about nutrition among health workers is demonstrated in prac-
tice. First, surveyed health center staff tend not to recognize stunted children, with many
regarding stunting as normal, particularly in localities where stunting is highly prevalent.
Second, while 98 percent of health center workers would take measurements and correctly
interpret growth charts, only a moderate number actually offered critical recommenda-
tions through nutrition and growth promotion counseling. For example, only 34 percent
of health workers in the Northern region provide counseling on breastfeeding while only
24 percent of health center workers in the Southern region provide advice on hygiene and
sanitation.

9.	      The qualitative study finds that growth monitoring is mainly done as a statistical
exercise, and often not accompanied by nutrition and growth promotion counseling. To
most health workers, the purpose for growth monitoring is primarily to report children’s nu-
trition status to District Health Offices (DHOs) and Provincial Health Offices (PHOs). Thus,
if children are found to be stunted or underweight during growth monitoring, health center
staff oftentimes do not inform mothers of the results, investigate the causes of growth fal-
tering, or subsequently counsel on how to improve the situation and make an appointment
for follow-up. Furthermore, PHOs and DHOs also rarely follow up on submitted nutrition
status reports.

Policy recommendations
10.	    Reducing maternal and child undernutrition in Lao PDR requires a combination
of interventions that address the identified immediate, underlying and basic causes of
undernutrition. As mentioned in the Lao PDR National Nutrition Strategy, causes of un-
dernutrition are interdependent, hence requiring a holistic, multi-sectoral approach. This
should include interventions in agriculture (e.g. increasing agriculture income and diversi-
ty), education (keeping girls in school longer both to increase knowledge and to delay age of
marriage), social protection (e.g. conditional cash transfer), legislation (e.g. 6 months ma-
ternity leave to encourage exclusive breastfeeding and the Code of Marketing of Breastmilk
Substitutes) and the health sector. Acknowledging the importance of these multi-sectoral
interventions, this note focuses on recommendations about interventions implemented in
the health sector (including water, sanitation, and hygiene) in Lao PDR, drawing on findings
from the analysis.

11.	    Scaling up of social and behavior change communication directed at mothers,
child caregivers, as well as influential family members (grandmothers, husbands). This
can be done through regular face-to-face village-level nutrition education group sessions
as well as interpersonal communication during home visits by health workers and village
health volunteers/facilitators targeting pregnant mothers and lactating mothers with chil-
dren under 2 years. Individual nutrition counseling provided by well-trained health workers
will be a cornerstone of an effective and efficient program for behavior change, especially
on infant and young children feeding practices.

     12.	 Addressing weaknesses in the growth monitoring and promotion exercise by
     health workers, particularly in strengthening the skills and confidence among health
     workers in providing nutrition and growth promotion counseling. To achieve this, there is
     a need to (i) develop adequate growth monitoring and nutrition counseling curriculum for
     pre-service and in-service training; (ii) develop competent trainers both at central and pro-
     vincial levels to roll out nutrition counseling training at all levels, from the district, health
     centers to village health volunteers/facilitators; (iii) regular supervision and monitoring of
     health worker growth monitoring and counseling skills.

     13.	    Allocating more staff, especially female midwives and nurses to the health cent-
     ers to provide enough workforce to deliver necessary health and nutrition services to vil-
     lagers in respective catchment areas. This should also ensure diversity of ethnic groups
     among staff at the health facilities to help reduce language barriers with major ethnic mi-
     nority groups, as has been revealed in qualitative studies.

     14.	    Increasing effort to improve household sanitary environment is necessary, and a
     dedicated rural sanitation and hygiene program. To improve hygiene measures, hygiene
     and sanitation behaviors would need to be improved, but also the infrastructure would need
     to be developed. A dedicated budget line for the behavior change programs for sanitation
     and hygiene, such as intensive social mobilization through Community Led Total Sanita-
     tion (CLTS) approach is required for the scale-up of such programs outside of patchy areas
     where development partners support.

     15.	    The new initiative to develop the National SBCC Strategic Action Plan for im-
     proved health and nutrition in Lao PDR shows greater commitment from the government
     on SBCC, but dearth of knowledge about nutrition and lack of counseling skills to promote
     behavior change among health workers remains a major obstacle. A perfect opportunity
     exists for government agencies and development partners to join forces in strategizing
     and developing key messages, tools, communication channels, and implementation plans
     to promote SBCC among target populations as well as to identify and fill existing knowl-
     edge gaps. Health center workers as well as village-level facilitators/volunteers (e.g. village
     health volunteers, members of Lao Women’s Union, etc.) will be the backbone and the most
     important agents in the implementation of SBCC interventions at the community level.
     However, given the limited knowledge about nutrition among health workers, strengthen-
     ing knowledge and capacity of these health workers and volunteers as well as introducing
     innovative tools (e.g. mobile phone applications) to deliver effective nutrition-related SBCC,
     is a top priority.

     16.	    This policy note provides an overview of the size, severity, and key determinants
     of child undernutrition in Lao PDR and proposes recommendations for the scale-up of
     programs and interventions to strengthen the overall response to undernutrition in the
     country. The note draws from a multivariate analysis of determinants of stunting in ad-
     dition to descriptive statistics of nutrition-related behaviors and outcomes in the coun-
     try, using recent surveys.1 These analyses are complemented with findings from the recent
     qualitative-based rapid assessment of nutrition counseling and growth monitoring con-
     ducted during the early months of 2016 in selected provinces, to contextualize findings
     within the health sector’s capacity to deliver preventive and curative nutrition services.

     17.	     Poverty reduction in Lao PDR over the past two decades has been impressive, but
     economic growth has been heavily concentrated in urban areas.2 Lao PDR is a landlocked
     country with a population of 6.4 million and with a GDP per capita of US$ 1,800 in 2015, it
     is a lower middle income country. The country’s population is still predominantly rural (72
     percent), and the majority of its inhabitants are engaged in agricultural activities. Nation-
     ally, the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line fell by nearly 50
     percent, from 45 percent to 23 percent in the twenty years between 1992 and 2012. How-
     ever, with the incidence of poverty estimated at 40 percent in rural areas without roads
     compared to 10 percent in urban areas, poverty, along with lack of access to social servic-
     es, remain entrenched in remote and highland areas even though improvements have been
     observed. Infrastructure in remote areas is particularly limited, and many communities
     are inaccessible during the annual rainy season. These areas continue to be characterized
     by poor access to sanitation and publicly provided social services, especially secondary
     schools, hospitals, and health centers. About 60 percent of households in remote rural vil-
     lages did not have a toilet, for example.

     18.	   Overall, Lao PDR has made significant progress on several key population-based
     health outcomes over the past few decades. Life expectancy has increased steadily to al-
     most 66 years in 2014, up from 49 years in 1990. There have been significant declines in
     under-five mortality rates from 201 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 71 per 1,000 live births
     in 2013. This sharp reduction in child mortality meant Lao PDR largely met the child health
     Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).3,4,5 However, these improvements have been largely

concentrated among the wealthier segments of the population and a recent assessment of
54 developing countries ranked Lao PDR fifth lowest in terms of equity of access to mater-
nal, newborn and child health interventions.6

19.	    Despite these improvements in both poverty reduction and child health outcomes,
Lao PDR has had little success in addressing widespread undernutrition rates (Figure 1),
particularly in stunting. The country did not meet all of its MDG 1c targets of halving the
proportion of people living in hunger, as the prevalence of stunting among children under
5 years of age (44 percent) fell short of the target (34 percent). According to WHO clas-
sification, undernutrition in Lao PDR is a critical public health problem and child growth
outcomes reflect this challenge. About 44 percent of children under five are estimated to
be stunted, 27 percent are underweight, and 6 percent are wasted (see Table 1).7 These
percentages have changed little over time (Figure 1), and Lao PDR performs poorly when
compared to other countries with similar levels of income and to other ASEAN countries
(Figure 2). In fact, Lao PDR compares poorly with low income countries and lower middle
income countries on all nutrition status indicators other than wasting.

     Lao PDR Child Anthropometry Assessment Survey 2015 (tag-on to the National Immunization Coverage Sur-
     vey), which is unpublished, provides unofficial updated data on nutritional status in Lao PDR (underweight
     25.5%, stunting 35.6%, and wasting 9.6%). However, unlike the 2015 survey, LSIS 2011/12 (which is official
     and published) provides significantly more extensive data and allows for cross-analysis of nutritional status,
     infant and young child feeding behaviors, sanitation behaviors, and nutrition service delivery during the same
     period. Hence, this policy note applies nutritional status data from LSIS 2011/12 for consistency.

     20.	    Even, these aggregate numbers hide substantial spatial variations with far worse
     outcomes in some provinces. Stunting rates are higher than 60 percent in Sekong and
     Phongsaly, for example - far higher than the national average (see Figure 3). There is also
     significant variation across income levels with both stunting and underweight among chil-
     dren in the poorest wealth quintile being close to three times than the rates for children in
     the richest quintile (see Figure 4). The absolute number of stunted children may actually
     have increased due to population growth given that since the early 1990s, stunting has
     declined at an average annual rate of 0.8 percent8, which is less than the average popula-
     tion growth rate. Without a change in these trends, the number of stunted children could
     increase.

          For context, the average annual reduction rate worldwide is 2.1 per cent. UNICEF, WHO and World Bank
          (2012).

21.	    These poor child growth outcomes are not just a public health problem, but also
carry an economic cost, and these are perpetuated in the long term. Undernutrition during
pregnancy and the first two years of life (“The First 1,000 Days”) affects physical growth,
impairs cognitive development, and affects educational performance, thus reducing the ac-
cumulation of human capital, hence the productive potential and lifelong trajectory of the
earnings of affected children.9 Poor child nutrition outcomes also contribute to child mor-
tality and morbidity. So there are also costs associated with lost potential workforce due
to early mortality and excess costs of care for otherwise preventable illness. These have
economy-wide effects. Adding them together, a 2013 analysis estimated that the burden
of undernutrition may cost the country up to US$199 million annually (approximately 2.4
percent of GDP).10

22.	     Recognizing the importance of the challenge undernutrition poses in Lao PDR, a
number of published and unpublished work on nutrition has been done in Lao PDR.11 This
policy note makes a specific contribution by grounding the analysis on Lao PDR specific
data to identify constraints that are binding Lao PDR and not just rely on international
evidence. In particular, the use of multivariate analysis pulling together all the components
of the determinants of stunting sets apart this analysis from previous work in Lao PDR
that have mainly employed descriptive or univariate analysis in looking at this issue, or
when multivariate analysis is done, limited components have been included in the analysis.
Yet it is well known that determinants of undernutrition are interrelated, thus multivariate
analysis using a complete set of components that are known to drive undernutrition con-
trols for the correlation between these variables and helps identify the most important de-
terminants, while also grounding the evidence on Lao PDR specific data rather than merely
following international evidence. Furthermore, the policy note uses qualitative and quanti-
tative studies that reveal specific gaps in skills and behaviors of health workers in deliver-
ing nutrition services, including nutrition counseling and growth monitoring. These aspects
of the analyses are novel in Lao PDR. In so doing, the note comes up with some new findings
or clarifies other issues. These will be highlighted in the rest of this document, starting with
findings on the causes of child undernutrition in the next section (Part II), followed by an
assessment of the key challenges and bottlenecks in nutrition service delivery in Part III.
Conclusions drawn from these findings are presented in Part IV, which also presents policy
recommendations.

     Part II: Causes of Child Undernutrition
     23.	 The causes of undernutrition in children are multi-faceted, multi-sectoral and
     interdependent. According to the widely used Lancet 2013 conceptual framework,12 un-
     dernutrition is an outcome of immediate, underlying and basic causes. At the immediate
     level, nutritional status is ultimately determined by the availability of nutrients to the body
     in order to meet its requirements and a healthy status as well as by diseases (incidence,
     duration, severity); while the underlying causes are related to food security (access, avail-
     ability and utilization of food), maternal and child caring practices, water and sanitation
     and personal hygiene. The basic causes driving these determinants include institutional/or-
     ganizational, political and ideological, economic, social (e.g. social status of women) as well
     environmental constraints. In addition, human-made disasters such as conflicts and wars
     as well as natural disasters such as recurrent floods and droughts exacerbate the situation.

24.	    Given the interdependence of these causes, a multi-variate analysis of the deter-
minants of stunting was undertaken to identify factors that are likely to matter most
for influencing child growth outcomes in Lao PDR. The multivariate analysis uses a probit
model to test the relationship between three groups of underlying factors and the prob-
ability of stunting in Lao PDR using data from Community Nutrition Project (CNP), 2010
baseline survey – the only available data with all three groups of factors together that
met recommended variable definitions. The first factor is dietary intake, using a dietary
diversity score constructed using WHO guidelines13 as an indicator of nutritional adequa-
cy14. Second, are factors related to adequate childcare activities, which include appropriate
home-based care practices and access to health care services, placing a particular empha-
sis on intergenerational elements in the analysis. The analysis include mothers’ education
and maternal body mass index (BMI) or height, in addition to younger age pregnancy15,16
and child birthweight17,18 as important intergenerational determinants of child growth. The
third type of factors are related to the physical environment in water and sanitation, which
affects child health directly via morbidity and indirectly via reduced nutrient absorption
due to environmental enteropathy.19 Results of this estimation are presented in Table 13
and Table 14 in the annex. To investigate whether greater access to diverse foods is neces-
sarily associated with improved child growth outcomes, this multivariate model was also
extended to test the relationship between agriculture, dietary diversity and the probability
of stunting (see Table 15 and Table 16).

     25.	     A detailed discussion of the analysis of the key determinants of undernutrition is
     presented below. The discussion starts with a careful examination of inadequate dietary
     intake, focusing first on its correlation with stunting, then an analysis of factors contribut-
     ing to inadequate dietary intake, evaluating the relative importance of access to food and
     feeding practices or intra-household allocation. Analysis of the impact of the burden of
     diseases is discussed next, establishing the channel through which it affects undernutri-
     tion, followed by an examination of the household and physical environment which are the
     main cause of diseases, highlighting the importance of underlying? factors on stunting. The
     multivariate analysis reveals a magnified influence of predetermined factors, those that
     are determined before the child is born, hence a separate discussion of the role of intergen-
     eration determinants of undernutrition is also made. All these factors are influenced by
     culture, social and gender norms, thus the discussion of determinants of undernutrition will
     be concluded by looking at these norms.

     Inadequate Diet
     26.	    Adequate dietary intake – both in terms of quantity and diversity of foods con-
     sumed - is essential for the provision of nutrients required for the normal growth and
     development of a child. The quality of the diet appears to be the most limiting aspect of
     adequate nutrient intake in Lao PDR, where dietary diversity is low throughout the coun-
     try. A survey conducted in six provinces in the central and southern regions (CNP baseline
     survey, 2010) shows that on average, over-6-months-old breastfed children only consume
     two food groups and that only 30 percent met the minimum dietary intake requirements.
     Another survey, (National Institute of Public Health (NIoPH), 2010 survey) found that 30
     percent (in Vientiane Province) and 5 percent (in Sekong) of children aged 6-23 months
     achieved the minimum dietary diversity, defined as consuming at least four food groups
     over a 24-hour recall period. Evidence from the multivariate analysis of determinants of
     stunting in Lao PDR20 shows that such low dietary diversity intake is a significant predic-
     tor of stunting, with the likelihood of stunting being five percentage points lower for 6-59
     months old children consuming at least three food groups in a day (see Table 13 and Table
     14 in the annex) compared to children consuming fewer food groups. This finding is similar
     to other studies across the world, which have shown that low dietary diversity is associated
     with low nutrient intake and is an important predictor of stunting.21,22,23,24

27.	    The observed low dietary diversity among children mirrors broad consumption be-
haviors at the household level in general, which are further aggravated by poor infant and
young child feeding (IYCF) practices, especially among children younger than two years.
Thus in digging deeper at the issue of inadequate dietary intake, we first look at the issue
of food insecurity at the household level focusing on access to food and overall consump-
tion patterns, and then turn to intra household allocation of food, especially as it regards to
dietary intake for children.

28.	     Analysis of household consumption patterns suggests that food insecurity at the
household level is of a lesser concern as a driver of inadequate dietary intake among chil-
dren. Nationally, calorie deficiency is less of a challenge. The LECS 5 survey shows that
in 2012/13, the average? calorie intake per capita per day was 2,751 kcal and this is well
beyond 2,100 kcal that is an adequate calorie intake deemed to meet the daily needs of an
average Lao person (see Table 2). The average calorie intake per person at the household
level also exceeded the daily minimum calorie intake requirements in both rural and urban
areas and across all welfare quintiles. Thus, a typical household in Lao PDR, even a typically
poor one, is not food insecure, hence food insecurity explains a smaller aspect of inadequate
dietary intake: what households lack is a balanced diet.

     29.	     Inadequate dietary diversity among children broadly reflects low dietary diver-
     sity in the household in general. As evidence from the LECS 5 shows, this is especially acute
     in rural areas where most households consume only three of the nine food groups identi-
     fied by FANTA and FAO.25 Dark leafy green vegetables are under-consumed in rural areas,
     especially among the poorest. Only 27 percent of households in the poorest socio-economic
     quintile in rural areas consumed them. Legumes, dairy products and eggs are consumed by
     a much smaller share of households. In all cases, urban households tend to consume more
     of these items than rural households (see Figure 5). This same pattern is observed among
     children. The CNP Baseline Survey (2010) that has individual-level dietary intake for chil-
     dren, for instance, showed that eggs, dairy products and legumes and nuts are consumed
     by less than 14 percent of both under-five children and their households in general. The low
     consumption of milk results in low calcium intake that can cause stunting while undesir-
     ably low intake of fat hinders the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. A controlled study in
     India found a smaller increase in serum levels of vitamin A in children supplemented with
     spinach compared to children who also had 10g of groundnut oil sprinkled to the spinach
     curry, for example.26

           30.	 But a substantial portion of low dietary diversity for children in Lao PDR is also
           linked to poor infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. Even though continued
           breastfeeding beyond one year of age is relatively high (nearly 75 percent of children aged
           12-15 months still receive breast milk at one year), complementary feeding practices for 6
           to 23 months old babies in the country are poor overall (Table 3) and mostly late, with only
           one-third of children aged 6 to 23 months receiving both breast milk and appropriate com-
           plementary foods. Early initiation of breastfeeding remains sub-optimal, with less than half
           of all children reportedly breastfed within one hour of birth. One-third of all infants receive a
           pre-lacteal feed, a food other than mother’s breast milk, that presents a barrier to exclusive
           breastfeeding and exposes infants to environmental pathogens.

       31.	     Crucially, a significant proportion of children are not fed important food groups
       even when the household consumes them or the food is available at the household level,
       suggesting low levels of nutrition knowledge and awareness. This is particularly the case
       for 6 – 23 months old children who are fed fewer food groups than 24 – 59 months old chil-
       dren. For instance, the CNP Baseline Survey (2010) shows that while 74 percent of mothers
       in the sample consumed vitamin A rich foods and vegetables, only 45 percent of 6 – 23
       months old babies did. More concerning is that only 60 percent of 6 – 23 months old chil-
       dren consumed vitamin A rich foods and vegetables even when their mothers consumed
       them, while the corresponding share is 90 percent for 24 – 59 months old children. The
       same applies to flesh foods, other fruits and vegetables, eggs and legumes and nuts (see
       Table 4), reflecting an inappropriate practice of late and sub-optimal complementary feed-
       ing for under two year olds. Highlighting the importance of feeding practices, both bivariate
       and multivariate analysis from the same survey shows that agricultural diversity is only
       associated with increased dietary diversity at the household level but not for children (Table
       15 and Table 16 in Annex) and no statistically significant relationship is observed between
       an index of agricultural diversity and the likelihood of stunting. This is similar to findings in
       other international studies.27,28,29 It signifies the importance of nutrition-related behaviors
       and practices, rather than just access to food, as an important contributor to stunting.

         32.	 Separately, home gardening is not a panacea to the low dietary diversity chal-
         lenges in Lao PDR; it has to be linked with changes in young child feeding practices. As
         highlighted above, there is a lack of a strong relationship between agricultural diversity and
         child nutrition outcomes, even though there is a positive correlation between household-
         level dietary diversity and agricultural diversity. This suggests a weak link for translating
         higher agricultural diversity into higher dietary diversity for children, namely that improved
         food availability at the household in many cases does not translate into improvements in
         the diet of children in Lao PDR. As shown (in table 4) 6 – 23 months olds are unlikely to be
         fed some foods even when such foods are available in the households. Thus, increasing di-
         versity in production alone without educating or changing behaviors of children’s caregivers
         about proper ways of feeding children will not have any meaningful impact. According to
         an earlier World Bank-supported study of infant and young child feeding in Lao PDR, there
         remains a widespread belief that young children know when and how much to eat. This re-
         sults in the absence of engaged and interactive feeding behaviors, and low overall dietary
         diversity in children.30

     33.	    A focus on raising awareness as well as changing inappropriate practices and so-
     cial norms in order to influence nutrition behaviors and habits is clearly needed in Lao
     PDR and can be successful. That access to food at the household level does not necessarily
     lead to higher consumption of some important food groups among children (particularly
     6 – 23 months olds) is a clear indication of this. It is also observed from the surveys that
     mothers who received nutrition education and growth monitoring and promotion services
     for their children are significantly more likely to feed them with eggs, dairy products and
     legumes and nuts (Table 5). This suggests that raising child nutrition awareness and pro-
     viding behavioral change communication, are important interventions in helping improve
     child nutrition outcomes, as part of a set of broader necessary interventions on nutrition.

     34.	    Agriculture sector’s potential impacts on improved nutrition are not only due to
     household production of diverse food for own consumption (e.g. home gardens and rais-
     ing small animals) but also a result of increased income through the sales of agricultural
     products, which enable the households to use the increased incomes to purchase diverse
     food, assuming that they are available and affordable in local markets. An asset index
     used as a proxy of wealth in the multivariate analysis, has a robust relationship with stunt-
     ing and accounts for some of the variation in child dietary diversity. Indeed, richer house-
     holds have been found to have a higher dietary diversity in Lao PDR even among those
     predominantly relying on rice production – although rural households in general have lower
     dietary diversity than urban households. Especially important to consider is that other ma-
     jor groups like dairy products are generally not part of food production system in Lao PDR
     production in Lao PDR but richer households have the means to acquire them and therefore
     consume them more.

       Burden of Infectious Disease and the Environment

       35.	    Infectious disease is an immediate cause of child undernutrition. The LSIS 2011/12
       estimated that 10 percent of children were reported to have had diarrhea in the two weeks
       preceding the survey. However, there is large regional variation in both the incidence and
       care for diarrhea, with over 16 percent incidence rate in Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Bokeo, and
       Luangprabang compared to only 5 percent incidence rate in Vientiane area (Table 6). While
       the highest incidence of diarrhea is highest among provinces with the highest stunting rates,
       multivariate estimates of the probability of stunting show a statistically insignificant re-
       lationship between diarrhea and stunting. This has been found in other studies as children
       tend to grow at “catch-up” rates between episodes of diarrhea. Rather, it is hypothesized31
       that a subclinical disorder of the small intestine known as tropical/environmental enter-
       opathy, caused by high chronic exposure to large quantities of fecal bacteria resulting in
       anatomical changes to the structure of the small intestine, affects a child’s ability to both
       absorb and utilize nutrients, leads to stunting instead. Although both the diarrheal and the
       tropical/environmental enteropathy hypotheses are premised upon fecal-oral contamina-
       tion.32

           36.	    Given its influence on the burden of infectious disease, access to a healthy house-
           hold environment—including appropriate water, sanitation, and hygiene practices—is a
           main underlying cause of child undernutrition. Unsafe drinking water is a common cause
           of several diseases, including trachoma, cholera, typhoid and schistosomiasis, while expo-
           sure to fecal contamination in the environment (due to unsafe disposal of infant and child
           feces, open defecation, exposure to soil contaminated with human and animal feces, and
           poor hand hygiene practices) increases the diarrheal disease burden.33 Even when exposure
           to feces does not cause diarrhea, chronic exposure can still impair nutrient absorption and
           lead to undernutrition as a result of tropical/environmental enteropathy. In Lao PDR, ac-
           cess to sanitation is particularly lagging. While approximately 70 percent of the population
           has access to improved drinking water, only 60 percent of households have an improved
           toilet and as much as 38 percent of households practice open defecation (Table 7). There
           are large regional variations, with 77 percent and 61 percent of households in Saravane and
           Phongsaly respectively, practicing open defecation. Although areas with the lower level of
           access to improved sources of drinking water are not necessarily the areas with higher
           stunting rates, those provinces with limited access to improved sanitation clearly tend to
           have higher stunting rates.

37.	    The multivariate analysis shows that poor access to improved sanitation is an
important predictor of stunting in Lao PDR. The predicted probability of stunting among
6 – 23 months old children is 6 and 14 percentage points higher when the share of the
population practicing open defecation in the village increases from 25 percent to 50 and
100 percent coverage respectively. Children living in households with access to improved
water have a statistically significant lower probability of being stunted, but the estimates
are sensitive to children’s age. The probability of stunting is estimated to be 5 percent low-
er among 6-59 months old children with access to an improved water source. However,
there is no statistically significant change in the probability for a restricted sample of 6
to 23 months old. implying that a healthy environment affects age groups differently. A
potential explanation for this finding is that water usage and exposure to unsafe water is
higher among older children, resulting in a greater impact on stunting among older chil-
dren relative to younger ones, but it could also mean that improving water quality does not
adequately capture changes in hygiene behaviors like handwashing. Overall the analysis
suggests that improvements in availability and use of sanitation amenities are important
for reducing child undernutrition. Improving hygiene behaviors could be as important too.
Although improved sanitation appears to have more direct contribution to reducing child
nutrition, water access at home is reported to lead to increased use of water for hygienic
purposes, making investments in better domestic water supplies important as part of a
multi-sectoral approach.34

Intergenerational Factors
38.	 Poor maternal nutrition has intergenerational consequences as maternal un-
dernutrition is a root cause of inadequate fetal growth and ultimately can lead to child
stunting. Low maternal body mass index (BMI), or maternal underweight, is associated
with intrauterine growth restrictions,35 and nearly one-third to one-half of all growth fail-
ure by age two occurs in utero.36 The NIoPH survey, 2010 found that approximately 14 per-
cent of women aged 15-49 are underweight, putting women at increased risk of deliver-
ing low birth weight (LBW) infants.37 Insufficient fetal growth and nutrition intake during
pregnancy increases the risk of infant mortality and can have lifelong effects on the im-
mune function and cognitive outcomes. The incidence of low birthweight (LBW) varies a
lot across provinces in Lao PDR, being above 19 percent in Saravane, Attapeu, Bokeo and
Khammuane, but less than 10 percent in Vientiane province and Phongsaly (see Table 8).


34
   See http://ehg.lshtm.ac.uk/water-supply-and-quality/ It is also important to note that availability of im-
   proved sanitation facilities is not always translated into use. According to LSIS 2011/2, a significant number
   of households who have access to improved sanitation do not use it to safely dispose child feces. Only 35% of
   households that have access to improved sanitation facilities disposed child feces using improved latrines on
   their premises. A significant proportion of households choose unsafe methods instead, such as leaving it in
   the open (21%) or throwing it into the garbage (9.2%).

     39.	 The analysis of determinants of stunting in Lao PDR finds that mothers’ stat-
     ure and low birthweight are determinants for higher rates of stunting, even after taking
     other factors into consideration. The probability of stunting is 10 percentage points higher
     when a baby is born small in size (self-reported) than average, for example, or if the mother
     is 5 cm shorter than the median height. Other attributes of mothers are important too.
     The probability of stunting is lower by 5 percentage points when a child has a mother who
     completed primary education. These estimates are all statistically significant. The contri-
     bution of these intergenerational determinants of child undernutrition not only highlight
     the need for urgency in dealing with child undernutrition to minimize the impact on future
     generations, but also show how proper maternal care, not just child care, is important for
     combating stunting.

Culture and Beliefs

40.	 Food restrictions are prevalent across Lao PDR, and are especially common for
pregnant and post-partum women. Beliefs are usually promoted and at times enforced by
influential family members, including grandmothers and husbands. Mothers often report
that they are encouraged to restrict food intake during pregnancy so they can have smaller
babies and easier deliveries, and that food restrictions often continue through the delivery
and breastfeeding period.38 These food restriction practices can lead to an imbalanced and
deficient diet among pregnant and lactating women, which in turn is a key determinant of
maternal and child undernutrition. Beliefs also shape general child feeding behaviors, con-
tributing to sub-optimal child complementary feeding practices.

41.	    Culture is also a driver of early marriage, the primary cause of the high teenage
pregnancy rates in rural Lao PDR, which is an important determinant of stunting. About
19 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 years olds were pregnant or had already given
birth in 2012. Nearly all of girls who had pregnancy at this age (99 percent) were married,
pointing to a culture of acceptances of early marriage, although poor education is also a
contributing factor (22 percent of teenage girls who had been pregnant had never been to
school and 50 percent had at most primary education, compared to 8 percent and 30 per-
cent respectively, among girls who had never been pregnant). These teenage pregnancies
contribute to stunting since adolescent girls, who are still growing when they become preg-
nant, end up competing with their fetus in order to meet their respective nutritional needs.
The multivariate analysis finds that the probability of stunting is at least 10 percentage
points higher among children conceived by women below the age of 17, for example.

     A holistic, multi-sectoral approach to addressing causes of undernutrition will have greater
     impact

     42.	     Causes of stunting are interrelated, thus requiring a holistic approach in design-
     ing and implementing interventions. A compelling representation of this is made in Figure
     6 which is based on predictions from the multivariate analysis model for the determinants
     of stunting. Other than addressing mothers’ stature and teenage pregnancies, which are
     associated with the highest reduction in stunting by between 9 to 13 percentage points,
     individually improving the other factors is associated with only a 6 percentage point reduc-
     tion in the likelihood of stunting at best. This is in contrast to a more holistic, multi-sectoral
     approach, where simultaneous improvement in water and sanitation, dietary diversity, and
     vitamin A intake is associated with a 22 – 24 percentage points reduction in the likelihood
     of a child being stunted. This implies that a holistic, multi-sectoral approach will provide
     better results than addressing individual factors and that adequately addressing key fac-
     tors both before and after birth is necessary in order to accelerate the reduction of stunt-
     ing.

Part III: Key Challenges and Bottlenecks in
          Nutrition Service Delivery
43.	    As can already be seen from the above analysis, poor nutritional outcomes in Lao
PDR have complex, multi-sectoral causes. While food insecurity is part of the problem,
many causes of undernutrition in Lao PDR can be traced to people’s behaviors and prac-
tices, delivery of health and nutrition services, and access to basic amenities. Improve-
ments in nutritional outcomes require a holistic, multi-sectoral response aiming to educate
families on the importance of the first 1,000 days of life focused on (i) increasing access
and quality of essential health and nutrition services, (ii) appropriate feeding/consumption
behaviors and care practices for infants, young children as well as pregnant and lactating
mothers, (iii) increasing demand for consumption of diverse diets and (iv) increasing access
and demand for improved water and sanitation facilities to reduce the prevalence of dis-
eases.
32   Nutrition In Lao PDR: Causes, Determinants, And Bottlenecks



     44.	    The supply side plays an indispensable role in helping to generate demand for the
     adoption of optimal behaviors. This can be achieved through the delivery of social and
     behavior change communication (SBCC), including nutrition counseling, growth monitoring
     and promotion (GMP), provision of necessary micronutrient supplements and health care
     services, elimination of open defecation complemented by proper hygiene practices, provi-
     sion of water services, increasing access to secondary education for women (to combat
     teenage pregnancies and because children of educated mothers have better outcomes, for
     example), and promoting agriculture commercialization to increase income, or diversifica-
     tion of crops among subsistence households with limited access to markets.


      Box 1: What is social and behavior change communication?

      Social and behavior change communication (SBCC) is the use of communication to change behav-
      iors, including service utilization, by positively influencing knowledge, attitudes and social norms.

      SBCC coordinates messaging across a variety of communication channels to reach multiple levels
      of society. Communication channels include, among others, interpersonal communication, mass
      media, community consciousness-building, group education/discussion, advertisement, social
      media, etc.




     45.	    The health sector delivery system plays a critical role in addressing maternal and
     child undernutrition. Crucial intervention areas for the sector include:

     (i)	    Social and behavior change communication, including nutrition counseling and pro-
     motion of optimum maternal, infant, and young child nutrition and growth - The above
     analysis of the causes of undernutrition suggests that SBCC is crucial for combating un-
     dernutrition, given that feeding behaviors and habits are largely responsible for poor di-
     etary diversity, even in cases where the household has access to food. While nutrition-
     related SBCC strategy should encompass multiple communication channels, including
     interpersonal communication, mass media, community consciousness-building and group
     education that will help reinforce the same messages, individual nutrition counseling is the
     cornerstone of an effective and efficient program. Working with a mother to find one or two
     actions she can implement can be more effective tactic than the more traditional approach
     in which she participates in a group discussion from which she must extract recommenda-
     tions relevant to her own child, for example.39

Counseling is required for exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, educating mothers/car-
egivers on complementary feeding starting at 6 months with continued breastfeeding for
2 years, educating mothers and family members about adequate and diverse diet for preg-
nant women and mothers themselves, as well as providing advice on appropriate hygiene
and sanitation practices. The analysis highlighted that the gap between food access and
complementary feeding is greatest for the under-2 year old children, indicating a particular
need for raising awareness among caregivers of children at this age. Nutrition counseling
should be provided by hospital and health center staff during antenatal care visits, post-
natal care visits, well-baby/sick-child visits, and outreach visits. To reinforce the messages
from hospital and health center staff, it is desirable that nutrition counseling also be pro-
vided at the village level by well-trained village health volunteers and village facilitators,
particularly during their home visits to pregnant mothers, lactating mothers, and families
with children under 2 years of age.40

Nutrition SBCC needs to be multi-sectoral. While the health sector is responsible for SBCC
delivery focusing on dietary diversity, sanitation, hygiene, eliminating open defecation and
nudging behaviors to change beliefs and social norms that negatively affect child and ma-
ternal nutrition outcomes, the education sector can play a role in delivering nutrition SBCC
at schools during health and nutrition education classes, as well as supporting key early
childhood development activities including counseling and training of caregivers on early
stimulation of their infants.41 The international evidence demonstrates long-term impact
on later life cognitive development, school performance, and adult earnings from the com-
bination of early stimulation and improved nutrition in the first years of life.42 The agri-
culture sector can also play an important role in promoting agriculture-related SBCC, e.g.
promote home gardens among farmers to grow diverse crops and to keep small animals for
child and household consumption.




40
   In terms of political and legislative environment, the Government of Lao PDR has successfully passed legisla-
   tion granting five months of maternity leave to working women in the formal sector to facilitate exclusive
   breastfeeding, although additional measures are needed to address working women in the informal sector.
   Furthermore, the Government can ensure the protection of breastfeeding through implementation of the
   Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes.
41
   Furthermore, the Government may consider financial incentive programs as a pathway to enable the poorest
   and most marginalized ethnic communities to access nutrition counseling as well as other health and nutri-
   tion services.

     (ii)	   Micronutrient supplementation - Due to low consumption of micronutrient-rich
     foods, national efforts to address micronutrient deficiency in the short term should em-
     phasize supplementation with key vitamins and minerals for pregnant mothers, infants,
     and young children. Evidence from the analysis shows that intake of vitamin A tablets and
     folate have the highest correlation with child height for age and the likelihood of stunt-
     ing.43 The likelihood of a child being undernourished was 11 percentage points lower if the
     child took vitamin A. Increasing coverage of vitamin A supplementation for children 6-59
     months can contribute to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality and improving cover-
     age of iron – folic acid supplementation for pregnant women can reduce risk of maternal
     anemia, maternal mortality, and low birth weight – which are all underlying determinants
     of undernutrition.

     (iii)	  Appropriate nutritional care of sick and malnourished children – proper care and
     treatment of malnourished children remains an important function of the health sector
     nutrition service delivery. Conducting regular growth monitoring and nutrition counseling
     (including on child feeding during illness), providing treatment for all acute malnutrition
     cases, and promoting ORS with zinc for the treatment of acute diarrhea will be important.
     Growth monitoring and promotion, if conducted on a monthly basis, helps identify children
     who are falling off the curve,

     (iv)	   Water, Sanitation and hygiene promotion services – the water and sanitation sec-
     tor in Lao PDR, is part of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Public Works mandate, hosted
     with its Center for Environmental Health and Rural Water Supply, and its district branches.
     Integrated and linked to health sector nutrition intervention, a dedicated rural sanitation
     and hygiene program is essential to improving household sanitary environment. As an il-
     lustration, a World Bank supported district-wide program combining Community Led Total
     Sanitation (CLTS) approaches and a sanitation marketing program executed by district
     Nam Saat witnessed increases in access of around 20 percent annually. To improve hy-
     giene measures, not only behaviors would need to be addressed, but also the infrastructure
     would need to be developed to increase access to water supplies at home, and to ensure
     the service is managed sustainably. Challenges to be addressed on this front relate to both
     expansion and sustainable management of community-water supplies, which will require
     technical backstopping and maintenance support from currently under resourced district
     Nam Saat staff and budgets. A dedicated budget line for the behavior change programs for
     sanitation and hygiene, such as intensive social mobilization through CLTS approaches is
     required for the scale-up of such programs outside of patchy areas where other develop-
     ment parterns support.

46.	    In light of the role of the health sector, this section presents an analysis of the cur-
rent status of nutrition service delivery to identify challenges and bottlenecks that need
to be addressed. The analysis utilizes data from the UFGE health center workers survey
of 120 public health centers and 232 health center workers across the country conducted
during 2013 and 2014 to assess nutrition service delivery,44 workforce, and supplies.45 Data
was collected on a range of indicators, including infrastructure and stocking of facilities,
as well as staff numbers, training and knowledge. This data provides an important lens for
understanding the complexity of nutrition challenges in the country.

47.	    Findings from the survey are complemented with findings from a qualitative,
rapid assessment of nutrition counseling and growth monitoring in Lao PDR. This was
conducted in Xiengkhouang and Houaphanh provinces and Vientiane Capital. The rapid as-
sessment included (i) 23 semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) with Provincial Health
Office (PHO), District Health Office (DHO), provincial hospital, district hospital and health
center staff and (ii) 26 focus group discussions (FGDs) covering 175 participants across
Lao-Tai, Hmong, and Mon-Khmer ethno-linguistic groups and targeting pregnant mothers,
mothers with children aged 0-23 months old, as well as grandmothers and husbands. The
qualitative study also included observations and case studies.




44
 Including inpatient, outpatient and outreach services. Services include ANC, PNC and child wellness services.
45
 Of the 120 health centers surveyed, 36 were in the North region, 36 were from the Central region; and 48
 were form the South region. Of the 120, 81 were in rural areas and the remaining 39 were urban health cent-
 ers. Sampling: of the 120 health centers, 80 health centers were randomly sampled with equal probability of
 selection from a register of all health centers in Lao PDR obtained from the Department of Health Care, and
 data collection was performed from May to June 2014. This sample was combined with an earlier sample,
 which used nearly identical survey instruments, of 04 health centers which were surveyed as a part of an
 impact evaluation of a project in the central and southern provinces. There were no significant differences in
 relevant parameters between the two samples. Data collection was performed from May to July 2013. For
 each health center, two health workers (all types and cadres) were sampled randomly without replacement,
 resulting in a total health worker sample of 232. Eight missing health workers are officially on the health
 worker roster but could not be located after three attempts or did not consent for an interview.

Nutrition Service Delivery

48.	     The distribution of health workers does not match the spatial pattern of maternal
and child undernutrition-related health needs. Health centers are the primary health fa-
cilities responsible for delivering nutrition and primary health care services in the country,
which are supposed to include antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), growth monitor-
ing and nutrition counseling, provision of micronutrient supplementation, immunization,
outreach services, as well as provision of other preventative and curative child health ser-
vices. Cases that are too complicated to be handled by health center staff are then referred
to district and provincial hospitals. There are around 860 health centers in Lao PDR.46 With
slightly under 4,000 qualified health care professionals, the country had approximately
0.69 health workers per 1,000 population. In addition to being significantly lower than the
2.5/1,000 ratio recommended by the WHO, health workers were disproportionately con-
centrated in urban areas, away from the main burden of maternal and child undernutrition.
Based on the Health Center Workforce Survey (2013/4), the median number of health work-
ers per a health center was four. Most health center workers were either medical assistants
(30 percent) or nursing professionals (37 percent). Midwives who provide critical antennal
and obstetric services comprised 15 percent of health center workforce, and only 4 percent
were medical doctors. Where medical doctors are not available, medical assistants usually
head the health centers. While in theory nurses and midwives have more direct responsi-
bility in providing routine nutrition services and counseling, in practice all staff catego-
ries have been involved in providing nutrition services, given the small number of staff per
health center. 47

         49.	 Opportunities to provide nutrition services at health centers are often missed
         even though antenatal care (ANC), child preventative and curative services are widely
         available. Table 9 shows that nearly all surveyed health centers (98 percent) offer ANC and
         child preventive and curative health services (96 percent). Over a six-month period, most
         outpatient visits at the sampled health centers were for child health services, followed by
         ANC and postnatal care (PNC).48 However, zinc supplementation to children - an important
         therapeutic intervention during treatment of diarrhea - is provided at only 68 percent of
         the facilities.49 Notably, health centers in the Northern region are significantly less likely
         than those in the Central and Southern regions to offer iron or folic acid during ANC. Al-
         though MOH guidelines stipulate that ANC and PNC services be available through outreach,
         survey data indicate that less than 5 percent of ANC visits occur in the community.50

       Health and Nutrition Workforce

       50.	    General staff readiness to provide nutrition-related services is low. The problem is
       most acute in the Northern region, where only 43 percent and 37 percent of health centers
       had one or more staff with training in IMCI and growth monitoring respectively, in two years
       prior to the survey (Table 10). In all, two-thirds (67 percent) of individual health workers
       reported never having received training in nutrition, yet 87 percent of staff had provided
       these services in the three months prior to the survey. This was confirmed during focus
       group discussions (FGDs) of the qualitative study during which health workers revealed a
       lack of confidence in providing nutrition counseling and the majority reported not receiving
       any training on nutrition counseling.

     51.	   Knowledge tests show that cadres mainly responsible for delivering nutrition ser-
     vices at health centers only have limited knowledge about managing child undernutri-
     tion cases. When tested, the composite scores for oral examination, physical examination,
     and treatment recommendations for a child malnutrition case varied significant by health
     worker cadre. As shown in Figure 7, medical doctors’ mean scores were significantly higher
     than those of all cadres except paramedics, though only 4% of health centers are staffed
     by doctors and also they are not directly responsible for routine implementation of growth
     promotion and nutrition counseling.52 Nurses and midwives, who are responsible for provid-
     ing these services, only exhibited average knowledge, while medical assistants, who often
     act as the heads of health centers (where there is no medical doctor), have much poorer
     knowledge about nutrition compared with other cadres.

          scoring methods for the Lao PDR health center workforce ability survey. In short, staff were presented with
          four clinical cases and asked to a detailed description of his/her response. National and international guide-
          lines were consulted in order to construct the case and potential responses in a locally contextualized man-
          ner. A panel of national health staff were consulted and created a consensus score for the vignette, against
          which health worker responses were scored. The health worker’s total score for the case has been normalized,
          with scores presented as standard deviations from the mean for each case. The results presented herein re-

52.	     This poor knowledge about delivering nutrition services among health workers is
demonstrated in practice. Surveyed health center staff demonstrated a general lack of
capacity to respond to child growth faltering as staff tend not to recognize stunted chil-
dren, particularly in areas where stunting is common. When faced with a concerned moth-
er, nearly all health center workers (98 percent) would take measurements and correctly
interpret growth charts. However, only a moderate number of health center staff offered
critical recommendations through nutrition and growth promotion counseling (Figure 8).
Important regional differences were found. Only 34 percent of health workers in the North
provide counseling on breastfeeding, compared with 46 percent in the Central region. In
contrast, only 24 percent of health center workers in the South provided advice on hygiene
and sanitation, compared with 54 percent of health center workers in the North.

53.	    Growth monitoring is mainly done as a statistical exercise, and oftentimes moth-
ers do not receive the results nor nutrition counseling (i.e. growth promotion) following
the growth monitoring exercise. To most health workers, the purpose for growth moni-
toring is primarily to report children’s nutrition status to the higher level – Head of DHO
(through the statistics unit) and DOH’s MCH unit – on a monthly basis. Thus, if children are
found to be stunted or underweight during the growth monitoring session, health center
staff oftentimes do not inform mothers of the results of growth monitoring, investigate
the causes of growth faltering, or subsequently counsel on how to improve the situation
and make an appointment for follow-up. In addition, it appeared that many health center
staff did not plot growth charts in children’s pink books (a health record for children under
5 years kept by the family). The qualitative study team inspected 30 pink books belong-
ing to children who received growth monitoring services, and found no record that growth
measurements were plotted in the books.

54.	 Follow-up action on growth monitoring reports is weak. All health center staff
from the study lamented that DHO and PHO have never taken any action on the reports
on children’s nutritional status from growth monitoring sessions that they submitted on
a monthly basis. These health center staff indicated they would like to receive DHO’s and
PHO’s guidance on what action they need to take after submitting nutritional status re-
ports.

     55.	     The qualitative study also revealed that many health staff did not regard “child-
     hood stunting” as a problem. All health center staff and 90 percent of district hospital MCH
     staff interviewed by the study team were unable to correctly define the different forms of
     undernutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight). Only one out of ten MCH staff at Houa-
     phanh provincial hospital could list and describe correctly the different types of undernutri-
     tion including stunting. Many health center staff commented on stunted children that “they
     still look okay” and that “they are not skinny”, thus do not provide appropriate counseling.

     56.	    Among those health center staff who do provide nutrition counseling, it was found
     that the focus of the counseling was mainly on maternal, infant and young child feeding,
     few provide advice on hygiene, and sanitation. Also, most health center staff gave the same
     advice about complementary feeding for every child, regardless of his/her nutritional sta-
     tus. Proper nutrition and IYCF counseling requires in-depth probing and discussion to iden-
     tify barriers to optimum nutrient intake (illness, insufficient food quantity, insufficient food
     quality, difficulty in feeding) and to support the mother in identifying appropriate solutions.
     However, the same advice was given for normal, moderately, and severely malnourished
     children, without understanding the specific circumstances and potential causes of growth
     retardation.

     57.	     Growth monitoring and nutrition counseling services are rarely provided during
     outreach. Health center staff are supposed to conduct MCH outreach services to rural and
     remote villages on a quarterly basis. Such visits would offer an excellent opportunity to
     provide nutrition education to villagers who do not live close to health facilities. However, it
     was found that the main service provided during outreach is immunization. Staff reported
     that they could not conduct growth monitoring during outreach, as they could not bring
     along weighing scales and height boards for measurement. Also, they reported that they
     did not provide health and nutrition education or counseling during outreach, not only be-
     cause of the time constraints but also that they have nothing to attract villagers’ attention
     (e.g. no posters, flipcharts or other communication materials).

     58.	    The study also finds that weighing and height measuring sometimes was not con-
     ducted in a correct manner, leading to inaccurate results. Observations during the win-
     ter revealed that babies were weighed with their thick winter clothes and that weighing is
     generally performed outside on the terrace in the cold, even when the health facility was
     equipped with heaters and the temperature inside the facility was warm. Some infants
     were even wrapped in blankets during weighing and had hats on during height measure-
     ment. These practices lead to inaccurate weight/height measurement.

59.	    While non-Lao-Tai ethnic groups in rural areas generally bear a higher burden of
child stunting, there are still linguistic barriers that prevent them from benefiting fully
from nutrition services when these services are made available to them. The qualitative
study finds that, unlike the Lao-Tai ethnic group, non-Lao-Tai ethnic groups often could not
benefit as much from health and nutrition education/counseling due to linguistic barriers
as the majority of the health center staff is of Lao-Tai origin and often do not speak other
ethnic languages. Due to the lack of access to formal education, many Hmong and Khmu
women could not understand Lao. Among those who could understand Lao, many were shy
to speak Lao. Nearly all of the mothers from ethnic groups in the study reported that they
were too shy to ask health center staff questions about health and nutrition, even if they
could understand and speak Lao. They also reported that sometimes health staff do not
quite understand them when they speak Lao.

        Nutrition Equipment and Supplies
        60.	     Despite dependence on revenues from drug sales, nutrition service readiness—as
        measured by the availability of essential medicines, equipment, and supplies—was gen-
        erally poor, indicating problems with planning, budgeting, and/or supply chain manage-
        ment. Table 11 summarizes the availability of nutrition-related equipment, diagnostics,
        medicines, and commodities recommended for ANC and child preventive/curative care.
        Though health centers are responsible for detection of pregnancy problems including ane-
        mia53, very few health centers have diagnostic equipment and supplies available. Only 56
        percent of health facilities had a length board and infant measuring scale; 66 percent had
        the equipment to measure wasting and stunting in children. Referring to Table 9, there is
        wide discrepancy between facilities officially offering essential micronutrient supplemen-
        tation and those able to deliver them. Iron-folic acid supplementation is supposed to be of-
        fered by 97 percent of facilities, yet the commodities are available in only 60 percent of the
        facilities. Even with sufficient health worker capacity, there are severe supply constraints
        which inhibit providers from complying with guidelines for ANC, management of acute mal-
        nutrition, and growth monitoring and promotion.

             61.	     Low supply availability may contribute to low coverage of vitamin A and iron in-
             take among high risk groups - women and young children. The programs have different
             modalities and distribution systems which contributed to variation in coverage. Vitamin A
             for children is a single capsule distributed semi-annually via mass distribution campaigns,
             while iron pills are provided to pregnant women at ANC visits. Children are most often su-
             pervised as they take their vitamin A. In contrast, women must take the pills daily on their
             own, often complaining of side effects, including nausea, thus in addition to availability of
             the pills for distribution, low compliance is also an issue. Therefore, iron distribution efforts
             have not reached coverage rates equivalent to those of vitamin A distribution campaigns.
             In the LSIS survey 2011/2, nearly 60 percent of children were reported to receive Vitamin
             A supplementation within the previous 6 months, but almost half of all eligible women re-
             ported having taken no iron pills at all during the most recent pregnancy, and only a quarter
             reported consuming 90 or more pills (see Table 12).

46   Nutrition In Lao PDR: Causes, Determinants, And Bottlenecks




     Part IV: Conclusions, Policy Implications,
              and Recommendations
     62.	    Reducing maternal and child undernutrition in Lao PDR will require a combination
     of interventions that address the identified immediate, underlying and basic causes of
     undernutrition. As shown through the multivariate analysis, these causes are multi-fac-
     eted and multi-sectoral, ranging from factors that are determined before the child is born
     – like mother’s stature, mother’s education, teenage pregnancy and maternal nutrition, to
     factors affecting the child after? they are born – like inadequate dietary diversity intake,
     micronutrient intake, and poor hygiene and sanitary environment, especially open defeca-
     tion. Social norms, including gender norms, and behaviors often drive these factors.
                              Nutrition In Lao PDR: Causes, Determinants, And Bottlenecks            47



63.	     Improving sub-optimal behaviors, especially infant and young child feeding prac-
tices, is important for reducing undernutrition going forward. Analysis suggests that de-
ficiencies in the quality of diet are a more important determinant of nutrition than just ac-
cess to food, and this can be traced to poor nutrition behaviors. Efforts to change mother’s
behaviors alone may not always work. In Lao PDR, mothers tend to be young and often fol-
low advice from influential family members, particularly grandmothers and husbands. It is
not uncommon for pregnant women in rural areas to receive advice from influential family
members that they eat less so they can give birth to smaller babies, contributing to easier
delivery. Social and behavior change communication, including nutrition counseling, are
needed to change current maternal, infant/child feeding and care, as well as hygiene and
sanitation behaviors, practices, increase health and nutrition-related service utilization,
and increase demand for required facilities and infrastructure related to water, sanitation,
and hygiene. Interventions are required at two fronts in this regard.

64.	   The first front is scaling up social and behavior change communications directed
at mothers, child caregivers, as well as influential family members (grandmothers, hus-
bands) at the village level. This can be done through regular face-to-face village-level nutri-
tion education group sessions as well as interpersonal communication during home visits
by health workers and village health volunteers/facilitators targeting pregnant mothers
and lactating mothers with children under 2 years. This can be further supported by mass
media campaigns.

65.	     The second front is addressing weaknesses in the growth monitoring and promo-
tion exercise by health workers, particularly in strengthening the skills and confidence
among health workers in providing nutrition and growth promotion counseling. Presently
some health workers cannot identify stunting, put it into context or communicate such
information to mothers. Rather, many primary health care workers capture child growth
information for statistical purposes. This should be changed by providing intensive training
to health center staff to effectively communicate nutrition and growth monitoring infor-
mation with mothers as well as to effectively provide nutrition counseling that covers not
only IYCF issues but also maternal nutrition, hygiene and sanitation, focusing on behavior
change. To achieve this, there is a need to (i) develop nutrition counseling curriculum for
pre-service and in-service training; (ii) develop competent trainers both at central and pro-
vincial levels to roll out the training for the district, health centers and village health volun-
teers/facilitators; (iii) nutrition counseling training needs to be rolled out at all levels with
specific focus on different types of undernutrition; (iv) regular supervision and monitoring
of health worker counseling skills. The current Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, and Child
Health (RMNCH) package also needs to be revised to include growth monitoring and nutri-
tion counseling in outreach activities, as well as include a requirement for village health
workers to conduct growth monitoring and nutrition counseling in remote villages with dif-
ficult access to health facilities.
48   Nutrition In Lao PDR: Causes, Determinants, And Bottlenecks



     66.	    Community-based delivery mechanisms are needed to complement facility-based
     nutrition service delivery. Health center utilization is low due not only to physical and fi-
     nancial factors, but also personal preference, cultural, behavioral, and traditional factors.
     This is likely to be especially relevant for maternal, infant, and young child feeding prac-
     tices. Efforts to reach women in their communities and provide services as well as social
     and behavior change communications there have the potential to increase the effective-
     ness and efficiency of existing facility-based nutrition investments.

     67.	      The new initiative to develop the National SBCC Strategic Action Plan for im-
     proved health and nutrition in Lao PDR shows greater commitment from the government
     on SBCC, but dearth of knowledge about nutrition and lack of counseling skills to pro-
     mote behavior change among health workers remains a formidable obstacle. A perfect
     opportunity exists for government agencies and development partners to join forces in
     strategizing and developing key messages, tools, communication channels, and implemen-
     tation plan to promote SBCC among target populations as well as to identify and fill exist-
     ing knowledge gaps. Health center workers as well as village-level facilitators/volunteers
     (e.g. village health volunteers, members of Lao Women’s Union, etc.) will be the backbone
     and the most important agents in the implementation of SBCC interventions at the com-
     munity level. However, given the limited knowledge about nutrition among health workers,
     strengthening knowledge and capacity of these health workers and volunteers to deliver
     effective nutrition-related SBCC, is a top priority.

     68.	     There is also a need to allocate more staff, especially female midwives and nurses
     to the health centers to provide enough workforce to deliver necessary health and nutri-
     tion services to villagers in respective catchment areas. This should also ensure diversity
     of ethnic groups among staff at the health facilities to help reduce language barriers with
     the villagers from major ethnic minority groups54.

     69.	    The identified gap in low micronutrient intake can also be addressed in the short
     term with micronutrient supplementation programs. Distribution of vitamin A as well as
     iron/folic acid should be improved to increase coverage. While there is little systematic data
     collection on nutrition-specific indicators, the UFGE Health Center Workers Survey (2013-
     2014) demonstrates a significant lack of nutrition delivery capacity in government health
     centers. Health centers have the primary responsibility for the health sector nutrition re-
     sponse, yet they have insufficient nutrition supplies, commodities, and human resources to
     make significant improvements in nutritional status.




     54
          Efforts are being made by the Ministry of Health to recruit large numbers of midwives to be posted at health
          centers, taking ethnicity into account.

70.	 Complementary investments in other areas will be necessary. Recent evidence
has shown that children’s exposure to fecal matter (mainly as a result of open defecation)
is strongly associated with stunting, meaning that interventions to improve child nutrition
outcomes must include efforts to improve sanitation, hygiene, and water across the coun-
try. Community-led total sanitation is an example of an approach that should be promoted
and expanded. Furthermore, increased household use of water for hygiene purposes needs
to be promoted; this makes investments in rural water supplies important, and that in-
vestments in behavior change need to be complemented with infrastructure and post-con-
struction management support to communities. Agriculture has an important role to play
in combatting undernutrition, particularly through (i) household production of diverse food
(e.g. home gardens and raising small animals) and (ii) increased income through agriculture
and for the households to use the increased incomes to purchase diverse food, assuming
that they are available and affordable in local markets. Nevertheless, it is important to note
that increasing diversity in agriculture production does not necessarily improved children’s
diet, and it is crucial that the efforts to diversify household agricultural production is com-
bined with social and behavior change communication interventions to change infant and
young child feeding practices.

71.	    Tackling social, gender, and cultural factors that drive intergenerational causes
of undernutrition is also required. Children born to teenage mothers have a higher likeli-
hood of being stunted, even when taking into account other factors, suggesting that deal-
ing with teenage pregnancies can also be instrumental in combating under nutrition. This
also requires interventions outside the health sector, e.g. focusing on keeping girls in sec-
ondary school and conducting social and behavior change campaigns aimed at delaying the
acceptable age of marriage.

72.	    Overall, no single intervention on its own will be a silver bullet. A holistic, multi-
sectoral approach of “plan multi-sectorally, implement sectorally, and monitor multi-sec-
torally” is called for. The analysis clearly demonstrated that addressing each factor indi-
vidually has a limited impact on undernutrition as opposed to simultaneously addressing
multiple factors. Causes of undernutrition are interdependent, hence requiring this holistic,
multi-sectoral approach.
