Growth rebounded in 2014 along with the lift of restrictions over credit and imports, tourism
expansion, and the resumption of hydropower investment. Bhutan’s significant dissaving is
illustrated by a large current account deficit. Priority will have to be given to private sector
development and asset diversification if Bhutan wants to reduce its vulnerability to donor finance
and address rising youth unemployment


Recent developments
Growth
With the lift of administrative restrictions on foreign exchange access and credit, GDP growth in
2014 is estimated to have rebounded to 5.7 percent, after reaching a bottom low 2.05 percent in
2013. Restrictions on credit, foreign exchange and imports, put in place in 2013 to address the
shortage of Indian rupees, were removed in July and August 2014 and replaced by more market
friendly macro-prudential measures on credit and higher taxes on vehicle and fuel imports to curb
domestic demand for Indian rupees.
The mains drivers of growth in 2014 included: (i) hydropower construction back on track after the
2013 delays due to geological disruptions (three major hydropower projects are underway--
Punatsangchhu I and II, and Mangdichhu, all developed under an inter-governmental arrangement
model between India and Bhutan (see Box 1 and Table 1)—and these projects have significantly
boosted the construction and services sectors); (ii) five-year plan implementation, now in full
swing ; and (iii) a record level of tourists visiting the country following a special offer to Thailand
over the low season of June-August.

On the demand side, private consumption, supported by an increase in wages, is estimated to have
grown by 6.6 percent. Growth of gross capital fixed investment is estimated to 22.4 percent,
masking an even larger increment in the hydropower sector. The construction phase of these

projects results in significant financial inflows into the economy outside the budget, because at
that time these projects are not yet the property of Government. The associated financial inflows
as forecasted could reach as much as Nu 50 billion, equivalent to a third of GDP in 2016. Since
these projects are highly capital intensive, most of the spending translates into imports. Still, the
local spending, albeit smaller, is still high, picking up at Nu11 billion, or 6% of GDP in 2016.

 Box 1: Hydropower in Bhutan
 Bhutan is blessed with a massive potential for hydropower generation (30,000MW), which the Bhutanese
 government has started to tap, with 1,606MW of installed capacity and an additional 3,153MW coming
 on line in 2018. Another 2,170 MW have reached agreement and are expected to start construction in
 2015. Lastly, there is an additional 8,068 MW which has been identified in the longer-term pipeline.
 Surrounded by energy-hungry India, the long term management of its potential hydropower generation
 is critical to meet the country development goals.
 Projects have been carried out in partnership between the Government of Bhutan and the Government of
 India under three different development models:
- The Inter-Governmental (IG) model (67 percent of identified generation capacity): The Government
of India is responsible for mobilizing the project’s funding and implementing the project until the time
of commissioning. Project ownership is then transferred to the Government of Bhutan, with an agreed
amount of debt repayment to the Government of India. The Government of India buys all the electricity
generated in surplus of domestic consumption, at a price determined on a cost-plus basis, guaranteeing
a net return of 15 percent to the Bhutanese government above debt repayment and the project’s
operating cost.
 - The Joint-Venture (JV) model (14 percent of identified generation capacity): Projects are developed
 and commissioned under a joint venture of Bhutan and India Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under
 a 50/50% ownership, with 70 percent being financed by loans raised by the PSUs, and 30 percent



                                                                                                           3
 equity participation, of which the Bhutanese share is financed out of grants provided by the
 Government of India.
 - The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model (13 percent of identified generation capacity): So far,
 two PPP projects have been developed with the support of ADB and the Government of Austria.

Private investment elsewhere has contracted in real terms, against the background of lagging
investment climate reforms, while public investment share in GDP, funded mostly by donor
resources, has remained the same. Export earnings grew at 12.9 percent, supported by tourism
expansion.
Inflation
Consumer price inflation in Bhutan has slowed to 6.3 percent in January 2015 from 11.3 percent
at the end of 2013. This decline was mainly driven by the decline in oil prices and India’s easing
of inflation (Bhutan has a fixed exchange rate with India from which it imports the majority of its
consumption). Food inflation (year-on-year) was 5.0 percent and non-food 7.1 percent while
imported inflation was 6.0 percent year-on-year in January 2015.

Employment and Poverty
Increasing youth unemployment, queuing for public-sector jobs, widespread informality,
underemployment and high reservation wages point to significant mismatches in the labor market.
Whereas in 2013 the overall unemployment rate stood at 2.9 percent, unemployment was more
prevalent among urban, female, and relatively well-educated individuals, and youth
unemployment reached 9.9 percent. Informality is highly prevalent, and public sector jobs are
more valued than private. Per capita income is estimated at $2,418 at end-2014, well into the lower
middle income category, under the World Bank classification.
The projected poverty rate in 2014 indicates that the pace of poverty reduction has slowed since
2012, the last year for which an official poverty estimate is available. From 2007 to 2012, poverty
measured at PPP $2.50/day decreased from 42.8% to 24.9%, or 2.6 percentage points per year.
Since then, projections based on GDP elasticity estimate poverty to have decreased at 0.9
percentage points per year, with a headcount rate of 23.0% by 2014. Inequality, measured by the
Gini coefficient of consumption, has barely changed, from 0.381 in 2007 to 0.387 in 2012, and is
not expected to change in the near future.

Fiscal Balance
In spite of an upward revision of public compensation in 2014/15, the fiscal deficit in FY14/15 is
projected at 2.2 percent of GDP (the absence of publicly-available budget execution reports does
not allow to gauge actuals for the ongoing fiscal year). Civil service wages and allowances were
increased in FY14/15 by 19 to 23 percent respectively, but the impact on spending is expected to
be offset by a reduction in other current and capital expenditures. Public wages had not been
revised since November 2010. The increase corresponds to a catching up of purchasing power of
civil servants. In fact, taking into account the increase in prices since November 2010 (+35
percent), the purchasing power of the median civil servant has actually declined by more than 8
percent.
Domestic revenues as a share of GDP have declined over the last three years, from 22 percent to
an estimate of 19.9 percent in FY14/15, while grants finance about 27 percent of total spending,
70 percent of which is from India. This decline comes mostly from a relative decline of public
revenue from hydropower as a share of GDP, while the tax effort elsewhere has remained about
the same. The reason for this is that hydropower generation has remained about the same over
recent years, awaiting new projects to come on stream, and that electricity tariffs do not keep up
with the rate of nominal GDP growth. As a result, the share of hydro revenues in GDP
mechanically declines over time.
Bhutan’s fiscal coverage of public spending by domestic revenues is forecasted at 63 percent in
FY2014/15, against a background of a 85 percent target by the end of the Five-Year Plan.

Public Debt
Bhutan’s public and publicly-guaranteed external debt stood at 95 percent of GDP at end-2014.
The rise in external public debt is primarily due to disbursements to on-going hydropower projects
(59.1 percent of GDP), which are financed primarily by India with a mix of loans (70 percent)
and grants (30 percent). External debt is largely denominated in Indian rupees (and related to
hydropower sector debt), which accounts for 64.4 percent of total external debt, with convertible
currency debt accounting for only 35.6 percent of GDP. Domestic debt is due entirely to a loan to
purchase aircraft for the national carrier Druk Air in FY09/10.
Bhutan’s rapid hydropower development is projected to lead to a substantial buildup of external
debt in the medium-term, with debt ratios breaching most of the country-specific indicative
thresholds. Bhutan’s debt situation is expected to improve over the long run, reflecting
significantly higher electricity exports when hydropower projects come on stream.
Bhutan’s risk of external debt distress continues to be moderate, based on the latest 2014 Joint
Bank-Fund Sustainability Assessment. This is because of the commercial viability of the
hydropower projects, the risk-sharing agreement with India for hydropower loans, Bhutan’s strong
track record of project implementation, rapid growth in energy demand in India, committed donor
support, and Bhutan’s high level of international reserves. Bhutan’s concentrated export base, its
trade structure, and its rupee-reserves mismatch with external debt leave it vulnerable to exports
and any shortfalls in aid inflows. Additional risks stem from bulky hydropower-related debt
service payments requiring provisioning of rupee reserves. Bulky debt service payments may have
contributed to creating a shortage of rupees in the past, hence the need for good cash/reserves
management and projections.
Hydropower projects bring strong economic dividends in the long term, boosting average real GDP
growth and exports. Moreover, despite the large increase in the stock of debt resulting from these
projects, their addition does not actually create substantial vulnerabilities in debt servicing over
the long term. The commercial viability of the new hydropower projects and the close economic

                                                                                                   7
and political ties that Bhutan has with India are all factors that mitigate the commercial risks of
these projects. India has been both the main financier of hydropower projects and the purchaser of
the projects’ generated electricity.
External Accounts
Bhutan runs a large current account deficit (estimated at about 29 percent of GDP in 2014/15), to
which the hydropower sector contributes about a third. Export revenues from sales of electricity
declined slightly, by 5 percent year-on-year, in step with less than expected rainfalls in 2014. Since
no new hydropower projects have become operational since 2006, the fluctuation in export
revenues reflects the vagaries of hydrological flows. The monsoon rains in the first half of 2014
were below those of 2013, explaining the decline of 4 percent in export revenues (year-on-year)
from sales of electricity in 2014 compared to 2013.
The potential for future increases remain strong, with the three projects coming on line in 2018
and 2019 expected to triple export earnings from hydropower from Nu 17 billion in 2017 to Nu 49
billion in 2021. Exports of minerals and mineral-based products account for more than half of total
exports, with hydropower exports comprising a further 45 percent, and manufactured products a
tiny 5 percent. India receives almost 90 percent of Bhutanese electricity production.
The tourism sector has turned into an important contributor of export revenues in recent years.
Tourist arrivals and revenues (from convertible currency-paying tourists) expanded at an average
of 15 percent per year in the five years to 2013. In 2014, a record level of 58,000 convertible-
currency tourists came to Bhutan, a jump of 31 percent year-on-year, earning the country US$ 73.2
million in convertible currency, a 15 percent increase year-on-year. Special new promotional
measures to attract tourists from Thailand have contributed to this growth. A similar number of
tourists came overland, mainly from India with light travel requirements, but the statistics are not
up-to-date for this segment.
The current account is essentially financed by donor resources, of which India contributes the most
through loans and grants to finance hydropower development. Foreign direct investment finances
a low 8 percent of the capital account (about US$ 20m). The recent amendment of the FDI policy
should help to attract more foreign investment into the country. In particular, foreign investors are
now allowed to repatriate their profits in the currency of their choice.
International reserves had built up to US$ 1,184 million by end-2014, reflecting prudent
management by the RMA. Reserves amount to 13.3 months of goods and services imports (the
Constitution requires that foreign exchange reserves should be maintained at 12 months of
essential imports). There has been a mismatch in the composition of Bhutan’s reserves and the
structure of its international transactions, as the country primarily needs Indian rupees for trade
settlement and debt service. Responding to this issue, the RMA has been implementing, since
August 2014, new reserve policy measures allowing the conversion of convertible currency
reserves into Indian Rupees above a threshold of US$ 700 million. As a result, the share of reserves
held in convertible currencies has declined to 72 percent at end 2014, down from 83 percent in
mid-2014, with the rest in Indian rupees.

Monetary and Financial Management
Simultaneously with the lift of credit restrictions, the RMA put in place strengthened prudential
measures in replacement and is closely monitoring credit expansion, to avoid another rupee
shortage. These measures so far appear to be regulating credit to the private sector successfully: in
2014, private credit growth grew at a moderate 9.4 percent, a stark decline compared to the annual
growth rates of 30-50 percent year-on-year during 2010-2011. From July 2014, credit has not
picked up, growing only by a low 1 percent.
Interest rates show little movement. The present base interest rate system, which establishes
individual bank maximum and minimum interest rates based on individual cost of funds and
administration, creates an unequal playing field and significantly undermines banks’ ability to
compete on price because individual bank cost structures vary a lot. There is inadequate
competition in price for lending to priority sectors, for the best customers, for government deposits
and for long-term deposits. Replacing the existing system by a uniform system-wide base rate for
the individual bank base rate could significantly increase price competition and allow more
innovation in the sector.
Strengthening supervision is critical. In the short-to-medium term, financial sector vulnerabilities
have likely accumulated. Banks appear to be well capitalized, with the risk-weighted capital
adequacy ratio rising to 19 percent in September 2014 compared to 17.7 percent in 2013. Non-
performing loans amounted to 11.6 percent in September 2014, compared to 12.3 percent a year
before. The decrease is mostly due to an increase in the loan portfolio (denominator) following the
relaxation of credit restrictions.

Lending remains concentrated in personal and real estate loans, which raises concerns. More than
a quarter of the financial sector’s portfolio consists of building and construction loans, followed
by personal loans that constitute around 16 percent of overall credit outstanding. Over the last four
years, credit in the economy has almost doubled, but only 39 percent of the new credit went to
productive sectors (tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, transport) while the rest was directed to
consumption. By institutions, the Bank of Bhutan continues to dominate the sector, holding 43
percent of market share.


 Box 2: Bhutan’s Business Opportunity and Information Center
 The Business Opportunity and Information Center (BOIC), established in 2014 in association with
 MoEA, is mandated to stimulate the growth of cottage and small manufacturing industries and the non-
 formal commercial sector by providing financial and back-up support. It is a time-bound autonomous
 agency, with a Nu 1.9 billion (US$ 31 million) revolving fund, as part of an Economic Stimulus Package
 that was intended to kick start lending – particularly to SMEs. A Nu 1.5 billion component of the
 revolving fund is available for lending to SMEs and CSIs engaged in manufacturing and production, in
 amounts up to a maximum of Nu 8 million per borrower. A second Nu 0.4 billion component is available
 for loans of up to Nu 100,000 per borrower for informal rural activities. To date, BOIC has approved
 more than 300 loans, with a total value of Nu 82 million as of December 2014.
 BOIC efforts to help SMEs access credit can potentially affect negatively e financial market
 development. The substantial funding available at very low interest rates is likely sharply to reduce the
 level of commercial bank SME lending. It may also be difficult to find sufficient attractive lending
 opportunities to utilize the entire SME fund within its five year period.

Efforts to deepen the financial sector in a sustainable manner are underway. A comprehensive
Financial Sector Development Strategy is being prepared with a careful sequencing of reforms
within a medium-term plan.

Outlook

In 2015, economic activity is expected to gain momentum, with real GDP growing at 6.9 percent,
driven by new hydropower construction and innovative tourism measures (“Visit Bhutan 2015”)-
-though agriculture is projected to grow at its low historic rate of about 2 percent. This projected
higher growth rate could risk a resumption of overheating and macroeconomic imbalances. GDP
growth it likely to vary between 3.6 and 7.6 percent the years after, before new hydropower
projects starting generation boost GDP growth from late 2018. Domestic demand will be driven
by hydropower investment and, to a lesser extent, government consumption. Consumer inflation
will closely follow India’s tracks.
The current account deficit is expected to continue growing over the next few years, driven by
hydropower projects in their construction phase. The current account deficit outside the
hydropower sector is forecasted to remain stable, supported by robust growth in the tourism sector
and donor grants. The fiscal accounts are assumed to remain in balance, supported by donor grants,
with current spending contained, and capital spending following the patterns of the five-year plan
disbursements. The revenue effort should weaken slightly, unless new measures to strengthen the
tax base and limit the many exemptions and holidays are introduced. With moderate growth,
poverty is expected to decline further, slowly shifting from rural to urban, along with migration.
The risk of Bhutan’s external debt distress continues to be moderate. This is based on the
commercial viability of its hydropower projects, the risk-sharing agreement with India for
hydropower loans, a strong track record of project implementation, rapid growth in energy demand
from India, committed donor support, and Bhutan’s high level of international reserves.
With faster GDP growth, poverty reduction is projected to pick up between 2014 and 2016 to an
average 2.1 percentage points per year. The poverty headcount rate based on PPP $2.5 day is
expected to be 18.9 percent in 2016.


Challenges
While Bhutan’s outlook is positive, macroeconomic pressures on domestic demand will have to
be managed. Hydropower-driven growth results in fluctuations not only in government revenue,
but also in aggregate demand. Some of the impact is through the public sector: as government
revenue from electricity exports increases, public sector expenditures go up. But the biggest
impact happens outside the government budget during the construction phase of major hydropower
dams, as this construction is associated with huge capital inflows. While inflows are partially
offset by imports of equipment and construction materials, they also translate into significant
additional domestic demand, through direct domestic spending and indirect spillover effects. This
calls for rethinking aggregate demand management in the context of lumpy capital inflows,
through a combination of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies.
Hydropower projects coming on line in 2018 and 2019 will provide the much-needed domestic
resources to finance the twin deficits in the fiscal and external current accounts. That said, the

                                                                                                 11
extent to which this relief will be lasting depends on whether hydropower rents will be used to
diversify the country’s economic assets and raise the tax base to ensure that the government-set
goals of fiscal, external and economic self-reliance are met.
Similarly, shared prosperity will depend on the ability of the economy to provide jobs to educated
youth, whose aspirations increasingly differ from existing employment opportunities, to address
the large informality in the labor market, and the large bias towards public sector jobs.
While debt risk is still moderate, the rapid-build-up over recent years cautions against any
additional non-concessional borrowing, given that Bhutan’s debt carrying-capacity will only
improve in the long run, reflecting significantly higher electricity exports when hydropower
projects come on stream. Efforts to deepen the financial sector will need to be sustained to provide
the country the basis for financing sound and sustainable development and diversification
Poor households also face new risks and vulnerabilities requiring new strategies. Limited land for
agriculture, higher exposure to international commodity prices and changing social structures can
increase poor households’ vulnerability to shocks and reduce their ability to deal with unexpected
situations. The government of Bhutan plays an important role in the development of new social
protection strategies to help cope with unexpected events, especially for the poor and vulnerable.
