Foreword
Since the late 1990s, Uganda has been undertaking an ambitious program to
reduce national poverty, emphasizing pro-poor service delivery and promoting
equitable economic growth. The urban water sector, specifically, has been the
focus of wide-ranging reforms targeted at reaching the poor.

At the institutional level, the national public water authority responsible for service
delivery in Uganda’s towns and cities - National Water and Sewerage
Corporation (NWSC) - has been implementing a raft of policies explicitly focused
on improving delivery of services to the urban poor.

This study examines the extent to which these reforms have increased water
coverage within Kampala City, specifically in informal settlements where the
majority of poor households reside.

This collaborative effort by the World Bank and NWSC seeks to identify and
document what works and what does not in reform measures aimed at reaching
the poor, and highlights the gains and challenges of making service delivery
pro-poor and managing service delivery reform to improve effectiveness and
accessibility.

We hope that this knowledge will contribute more insights to guide reforms
aimed at improving access to basic services by the poor, and enhance the
effectiveness of pro-poor mechanisms employed in the urban water sector.

                        were already being constructed every year before the policy. These baseline figures have not been included in the estimate of the additional connections that can be
                        attributed to the Affordable Connections Policy only.

                            •	 House connection: Individual metered house connection to the water supply network where the
                               point of supply is inside the house, and therefore associated with internal plumbing, showers,
                               taps, sinks, storage tanks, and so on. A house connection is always associated with some kind of
                               drainage system (network, pit, and so on).

                            •	 Yard tap: Similar to the individual house connection except that the point of supply is in the yard
                               and is usually shared between a small number of households (usually two to three). A yard tap is not
                               usually associated with internal plumbing or a drainage system.

                            •	 Public water point: Metered connection which is typically a battery of taps fed by one connection
                               and recognized as such by the NWSC. Public water points are usually managed directly by the
                               NWSC or someone appointed by it (for example, a community group, an individual, and so on).

                            •	 Kiosk: Typically, a battery of taps developed by a private individual (operator or community-based
                               organization) to sell water to the public. Kiosk operators usually charge a mark up on the normal
                               tariff. A kiosk implies a formal structure and attracts the preferential public water point/kiosk tariff.

The profile of unit consumption at prepaid PWPs/                      In addition, it is considered that low unit

                                                                      a large number of alternative sources of water
Similar to yard tap connections, 57 percent of the                    which are free or cheaper than the NWSC’s piped
prepaid PWPs report consumptions of less than                         drinking water. Thus, if individual household

                   Using NWSC data presented in Table 16, it is possible to estimate the total quantity (in UGX) which goes
                   to poor households, making an assumption that the proportion of yard taps over domestic customers is
                   similar in the NWSC’s service area as it is in Kampala. By calculating the average tariff per customer category
                   (using total revenue/customer category divided by volume billed) it is possible to estimate the flow of funds
                   that customer categories receive or contribute. Thus it is possible to estimate the level of subsidy that poor
                   households receive—per annum. This is summarized below.

                   The table suggests that PWPs receive on average UGX395,000 per annum subsidy, or UGX2,631 per person
                   per annum (assuming one PWP serves 150 people). Whilst it is not possible to estimate the average subsidy
                   received for yard taps compared to nonpoor connections, the average subsidy for connections is UGX68,319
                   per annum or UGX10,295 per capita (assuming a weighted average of 6.6 people per connection), which is
                   nearly four times as much. The consumption subsidy thus unequally favors nonpoor households instead of the
                   poor (PWPs and yard taps). This is due to the fact that they only use a small amount of water and that they
                   are not connected.

Water supply coverage has increased significantly
over the period, from 62 percent to 74 percent,
despite a population growth rate of 10 percent.
The total number of connections in Kampala has
increased from 59,000 in 2004 to 146,000 in
2010. Whilst most of the beneficiaries have been
the nonpoor (and industries), this increase has
had positive impacts on the poor by leading to a
reduction in the price of resold water. However,
the rate of new connections in poor settlements
has sharply reduced from 2009 onwards. This
is considered to be due to the fact that 18
percent of yard taps and 36 percent of PWPs are
inactive. This has prompted the Urban Pro-Poor
Branch, with support from development partners
(principally the KfW and GPOBA) to look for
innovative service delivery mechanisms, including
prepaid PWPs. This new approach is expected
to generate significant benefits to unserved areas                                                             © WSP

4.1 Cost implications:

Based on cost scenarios generated and presented for different lengths of service pipes, the Board
accepted the average distance of 50 meters from NWSC’s service point as ideal in terms of cost
implications.

Cost per connection:
The cost break down for a typical domestic water connection based on the distance of 50 meters is
given in the table below:

Estimated cost per connection (typical domestic ½” connection)


  Item	                                       Measurement	       Unit cost (shs)	         Total cost (shs)

  Pipe size 15 mm and less (DN 15,PN 10)	     50 meters	          600 shs/ meter	             30,000

  Fittings, tees, bends etc		                                            30,000	              30,000

  Saddle 	                                        6 inch 	              150,000	             150,000

  Labour	                                      50 meter	          660 shs/meter	              33,000

  Total			                                                                                   243,000



The average cost per connection of a ½ inch pipe supply is therefore estimated at Shs 243,000. This
cost does not include the cost of a meter which has always been an NWSC cost.

Based on the model for the domestic cost estimate, the cost for the other customer categories were
estimated as follows:

Water points/standpipes:	 Shs 400,000
Government Institutions:	 Shs 350,000
Commercial Industrial:	   Shs 450,000

The following table indicates the estimated annual cost of providing service lines for 14,000 new
connections based on the mean distance of 50 meters from the NWSC service point.

                         5.0 Implications on the tariff

                         In order to raise the Shs. 3.78 billion for the provision and maintenance of service lines, the tariff has
                         been increased by an average of about 10% as shown in the table below. It should be noted that in line
                         with the policy of re-balancing of the tariff, large industrial customers (consuming over 500 cu.m of water
                         per month) have been excluded from the tariff increase.

                         It should be noted that the change in tariff is solely due to the transfer of responsibility of providing and
                         servicing consumer lines from the user to the Corporation. For purposes of clarification, the table below
                         shows the impact of the change on the price of a 20 liter jerrican of water.

6.0 Implementation

The Board in its two sittings on the 18th and 24th June 2004 approved the implementation of the new
policy based on the following tenets:

      •	 The policy covers only water connections.

      •	 The policy will cover all customers within a distance of 50 meters from the NWSC service point.
         All materials and other costs including road reinstatement to be met by the Corporation.

      •	 The cost in excess of 50 meters to be met by applicant.

      •	 Customers will continue to pay the connection fee (e.g. shs 50,000 for domestic customers) as a
         commitment and contribution to the service.

      •	 The tariff is to be adjusted by an average of 10% to defray the additional costs of providing and
         maintenance of service lines up to the customers meter.

      •	 As in the case of the electricity industry, all service lines will henceforth belong to NWSC. This will
         allow more consumers to be connected to the service lines.

Following the Board approval, the Hon Minister of Water, Lands and Environment assented to the policy
through a statutory instrument (copy attached) which shall shortly be published in the Uganda Gazette.
As you will note the effective date of implementation is 1st July 2004.
