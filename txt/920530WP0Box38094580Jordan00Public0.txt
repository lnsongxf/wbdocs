THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      Obtain building permit

      A one-stop shop for building permits for certain categories of buildings
      has just become operational at the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM).
      The one-stop shop in GAM began handling building permit
      applications for projects in high-density, mixed-use areas; intensive
      development corridors, and industrial zones in 2008. In 2009, the GAM
      one-stop show also began accepting building permit application for
7     simpler commercial construction projects for commercial zones. As a         14 days       JOD 3,251
      result, builders in Amman now have another option for obtaining
      building approvals. Builders can either apply through local or district
      municipalities (where the one-stop shop system has yet to be
      implemented) or through the GAM one-stop shop which affords them
      a more streamlined process.

      Most recently, the Jordan Water Authority and Jordan Electricity
      Company have committed to faster approval times for building plans.

      These new internal deadlines also helped to shorten the overall time to
      obtain a building permit from the GAM one-stop shop from 28 days on
      average to 14 days

      Before a building permit is issued, a lump-sum refundable fee of JOD
      1,000.00 must be paid for the removal of any debris (JOD 990.00 will be
      refunded). The building permit is valid for 2 years.


      Agency: Greater Amman Municipality



      Hire an authorized engineering office for inspections of the
      construction site

      An engineering office is in charge of supervising the project. The
      municipality does not send inspectors to examine the construction.
      However, inspectors are sent to the site to ensure that there are no          1 day        JOD 4,747

      violations of the building permit. There is no limit on the number of
      visits, but they may not occur at all.

      Agency: Authorized independent engineer



      Apply for occupancy permit

      After completing construction, BuildCo must submit an application to
      the municipality of Amman (GAM) to obtain an occupancy permit. A
      representative of the municipality conducts an inspection to verify
      surrounding areas and the parking situation. There is a fine of JOD
9     30.00 for buildings with irregularities. Upon receiving the request for an    1 day        no charge
      occupancy permit, GAM forwards a notification to the Civil Defense
      Directorate to inspect and give their approval.

      Agency: Greater Amman Municipality



      Receive inspection of completed works from Civil Defense

      After the completion of construction, the owner, engineering office, or
      contractor, as agreed, notifies the Civil Defense Directorate that the
      work has been completed, and requests examination and granting of all
10    the necessary approvals. The Civil Defense Directorate inspects the           1 day        no charge

       from the Land and Survey Directorate

       The standard form is readily available. The land is also already registered
       in Land Registry with an updated certificate of ownership and a cadastral
       map. The clerk has only to make a copy of these documents and certify
       them as official copies. After the issuance of the Sale Form, the director
       of the Land and Survey Directorate sends a letter to the office of the
       finance minister asking that the Minister approve the company’s request
       to buy land. The Procedure consists of: (i) filling in the application at the
       Land and Survey Directorate , (ii) recording the sale application in a
       record kept by the Land and Survey Directorate, (iii) filling in the sale
       form according to the information provided by the parties concerned
       including ascertaining that there are no obstacles that would obstruct
       the sale at a later stage of the Procedures, and (iv) requesting from the                         JOD 6.55 for
       Land and Survey Directorate to send a letter addressed to the Minister of                      property deed JOD

       certificate evidencing that the persons signing the sale/purchase are
       authorized on behalf of the seller/buyer, and a copy of their ID cards.
       The Company’s statute must clearly state that the company can own
       lands, even if owning lands is not the company’s main objective and
       even if the company tends to own land to achieve other stated
       objectives in its founding statutes. Many lawyers always include, when
       drafting the company’s statutes, the right to own land. In case the
       company does not have this objective clearly stated in its statutes, an
       extraordinary session of shareholders should be invited to amend the
       company’s regime for this purpose. The new statutes had to be taken to

      value, taking into consideration the cost of the building erected on the
      land and the rental value of the premises. The architect will then prepare
      a report where he provides the estimated value that should serve as              4 days        no cost

      After the cadastral value of the property is determined, the registration
      fee must be paid according to the evaluation made by the land and
      property department. The fee was reduced from 10% to the current
      values on May 25 2009, by a decision of theCouncil of Ministers in a
      letter addressed from the General Manager of Lands and Survey
      Department/ Ministry of Finance (LSD) to the Ministry of Planning and
      International Cooperation (MoP). First time purchases of properties
      under 150 meters by a Real Estate or Housing Project are fully exempt of
      registration fees. Properties over 150 meters will be taxed for the amount
      exceeding the 150 meters at 8%. First time property purchases by an
      individual, however, will be taxed at 3% when under 150 meters and                          7.5% property

      taxed fully at 8% when greater than 150 meters. Any resale of property                          value
      purchased either by a Real Estate Company or an individual will be taxed
      fully at 7.5% for the entire space. The registration fee is paid at the Lands
      Department. The sale agreement is presented to the chairman of the
      land and property department and signed by the representatives of the
      two parties. The parties signing the agreement should be duly allowed to
      represent and engage the company. Two witnesses, other than the
      chairman, must also be present during the signing ceremony. The name
      of the seller will be deleted from the department’s files and the new

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Jordan (table 10.1)?

                    Jordan improved its contract enforcement system by setting
                    up a specialized commercial court division, equipping its
DB2010              courts with a computer-aided case management system and
