I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Bhutan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Bhutan
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    Project/Program Related Issues
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Bhutan
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From January to March 2016, 181 stakeholders of the WBG in Bhutan were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 102 stakeholders participated in
the survey (56% response rate).

Respondents completed the survey with the presence of an independent research consultant.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Bhutan; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Bhutan; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 64%, N=132). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, employees of a ministry and consultants working on WBG projects
       were combined. Respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with
       respondents from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based
       organizations were renamed as “CSO”; and few respondents from the Office of the
       President/Prime Minister, local government, and other organizations were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from the office of a minister, private
       foundations, the judiciary branch, trade unions, faith-based groups, or youth groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Locations
     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from outside of Thimphu (Ease,
      West, Central, and South), analyses comparing geographic locations would not be
      statistically reliable and, therefore, were not conducted.
                                          Percentage of Respondents (N=95)

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 6.2; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.0)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Bhutan, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Bhutan and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Bhutan
Headed in the Right Direction2
       Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, most respondents across
        stakeholder groups indicated that Bhutan is headed in the right direction, whereas
        respondents from CSOs were least positive about the prospect of Bhutan.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Bhutan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Bhutan. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Bhutan, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year20
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2013 appendices.

FY ‘13 Number of comparable respondents = 126  FY ’16 Number of comparable respondents = 97

By weighting the FY2013 data against the FY2016 data by the stakeholder group variable, the FY 2013
data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2016. Therefore, the two years are comparable.
Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister, the office of a minister, office of a
parliamentarian, private foundations, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary
branch were not included in the year comparison analysis, because respondents from these groups
were present in only one year but not both years. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is below:
