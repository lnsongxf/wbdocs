JOBS GROUP
JOBS DIAGNOSTICS GUIDANCE
WHY, WHAT AND HOW?
    BACKGROUND

    Recognizing that Jobs are the key to development, the World Bank Group is developing and
    piloting a new multi-sector `Jobs Diagnostic’ approach to help countries identify their key jobs
    challenges, and prepare strategies for addressing them. By following how people in the
    economy benefit from Jobs, by taking into account the country context, recent trends in
    productivity and employment, and by considering the existing profile of jobs and workers in the
    economy, the new approach seeks to identify the key constraints a country faces in creating
    more, better and inclusive jobs. The final step based on the country context and key
    challenges, is to help prioritize actions that a country can take to address these constraints.

    Whilst we are learning from experience in the piloting phase, the Jobs Group welcomes
    feedback on the draft guidelines.

    OUTLINE

    Why Conduct Multi-sector Jobs Diagnostics?
          Jobs are central to achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity
          Recognize need to take more comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach

    Use of a Jobs Diagnostic
          Covers the whole spectrum of `employment’ – eg agriculture, own account, self-employment,
          wage; formal & informal enterprises and workers; but excludes care of family & housework
          Standalone ESW to inform policy and operations
          Complement the SCD where expanding job opportunities is a key priority

    Objective: determine key challenges to “expanding job opportunities”:
          More jobs – for un & underemployed; to absorb new labor market entrants; creating more
          jobs that enable transformations (structural, spatial, formalization)
          Better jobs – higher productivity jobs, higher returns, better working conditions
          Inclusive jobs – for poor and bottom 40%, women, youth, disadvantaged groups, those
          previously not participating in labor force

     Elements of a Jobs Diagnostic:
     1.    Establish country context and key jobs needs (to guide diagnostic steps 2 & 3)
     2.    Interpreting the interplay of results: Identify challenges, constraints, synergies, causes
2    3.    Defining priorities and identifying possible solutions (lay out opportunities, trade-offs)
WHY CONDUCT JOBS DIAGNOSTICS?


    Jobs are the number one priority consistently expressed by the
    citizenry and by the policy makers of our client countries, independent
    of region or income levels

    Jobs are at the center of development, World Development Report
    2013 Jobs
       Labor is the most important asset of the poor
       Jobs are the most important pathway out of poverty
       Development happens through jobs
       How / whether job opportunities expand is a key determinant of
       how widely the benefits of growth are shared
    Expanding jobs is central to meeting the twin goals.
    Challenges are inherently multi-sectoral and complex

    WHY A MULTI-SECTOR JOBS DIAGNOSTIC?

    “Jobs” is about more than a specific
    factor of production, labor.
    Jobs challenges are inherently
    multi-sectoral and complex:
       Requires access to markets, inputs,
       capital, technology, skills, matching
       supply and demand
       Shaped by regulatory framework (not
       only labor regulations), macroeconomic
       conditions, rule of law, governance
       Potential for spillovers, “good jobs for
       development”, highlight different
       opportunities based on country context

    Most approaches to date have been sector-specific – But they
    have not had the needed impact.
4
       Wide consensus that we need to take a more comprehensive approach.
WHY A NEW JOBS DIAGNOSTIC?


    Most of our tools and diagnostics to date are sector specific and/or focused
    on growth or investment, not on jobs
       Investment Climate Assessments consider constraints to formal firms’ investments and
       productivity growth
       Growth Diagnostics (Hausmann, Rodrik, Velasco) are built around the entrepreneur’s
       decision to invest
       Skills Assessments consider the supply of skills across people
                  STEP surveys look at demand for skills too, but have limited links to firm
                  performance
       ADePT Labor provides tables that profile workers from households (supply side)
       Diagnostic Trade Integration Surveys mostly consider barriers to trade integration in
       products (and more recently services) and more recently exporters (firms)
    Existing tools each tell an important piece; we need to bring them together

    Benefits of a more comprehensive and multi-sector approach:
       Identify synergies and interactions across dimensions
       Build a framework to link analytic results to core challenges
5      Enables a more systematic approach to find possible solutions to jobs challenges
    USE OF A JOBS DIAGNOSTIC


    Examine links between jobs, growth and the twin goals.
    Examine opportunities for expanding job outcomes – looking at composition of jobs,
    determinants of mobility across employment categories and ways to raise
    productivity within categories
        Not just about expanding wage work or formal sector -- raising productivity of self-employment,
        agriculture and informal enterprises are important in many client countries
    Jobs Diagnostic can be:
        Standalone ESW or complement the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
          Particularly for countries where expanding jobs opportunities is identified as a priority, having a full
          jobs diagnostic would expand on the analysis included in the SCD
          Note: Separate guidance for more streamlined approach to incorporating jobs into SCDs is also
          available on the SCD and Jobs websites
    Identify priorities, binding constraints and possible solutions
        Intended to inform policy priorities and provide practical ways forward
        Offers tailored solutions to clients’ jobs problems, fitted to their contexts and jobs needs
    Bring together GPs to work collectively across sectors to identify synergies and
    trade-offs in addressing a client country’s key jobs challenges
    Share learning of multi-sectoral approaches to common jobs challenges
6
USE OF A JOBS DIAGNOSTIC: WHAT IT DOESN’T DO

    The jobs diagnostic does not cover the following related topics:
         A full growth diagnostic: there are elements common to both diagnostics, such as returns
         to education as a supply side test, and enterprise dynamics for labor demand, but where
         growth is insufficient to create enough jobs, a growth diagnostic is justified.
         Cyclicality in aggregate demand, jobs and growth; the diagnostic deals with longer term
         structural issues around demand for workers
         All links with poverty and growth – income sources beyond employment such as cash
         transfers.
         Social protection policies and benefits for those not in work such as social insurance and
         pensions transfers will not be covered, except under incentives to work
         Indicators of labor market institutions and core labor standards are provided, but will
         not necessarily be assessed in-depth unless raised as key constraints
         There is no assessment of implementation capacity or political economy of reform
         beyond team’s assessment in Step 3; more detailed work would need to be done
         separately or draw on the SCD/CPF.
         Solutions: the point of the jobs diagnostic is to help identify and prioritize key constraints to
         creating more, better and inclusive jobs to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity.

    The CCSA is capturing and curating global knowledge on jobs solutions for specific problems /
    constraints in the form of a catalogue of `jobs solutions’. This will be informed by past work of GPs,
    academic research and evaluations, as well as by the jobs diagnostics.
    The diagnostic is based on quantitative assessments of outcomes – it does not make normative
    judgments of policies, and although growth paths and opportunities are taken into account in
    identifying priorities, the diagnostic does not simulate nor model future jobs outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: DETERMINE KEY CHALLENGES TO “EXPANDING
JOB OPPORTUNITIES”

    1. More people join the labor force & find work (including self-employment) as firms start up,
    enter markets, and expand
            Firm dynamics (self-employment start-ups, firm entry and firm
            growth) leads to job creation                                                MORE
            Increased labor participation and increased employment rates                  JOBS
    2. Labor moves across from less to more productive jobs:
           Structural change reallocates across sectors
           Selection reallocates across businesses (and creates net more jobs)
           Migration reallocates across geography
           Formalization reallocates across businesses                                   BETTER
                                                                                           JOBS
    3. People get better at doing their existing job:
           Returns to labor assets improve (incl thru’ farming, self-employment)
           Labor productivity rises within occupations;
    4. Workers benefit from higher productivity through higher earnings and
         demand more goods and services.
    5. Externalities from good jobs support development
                                                                                        INCLUSIVE
    6. Remove barriers to accessing good jobs; opportunities are                            JOBS
         Open to the poor and bottom 40%, women, youth, disadvantaged
     3 goals are not mutually exclusive – e.g. want ‘more’ jobs created to be ‘better’ ones –
8    and can involve trade-offs – e.g. raising productivity may reduce the number of net jobs
ELEMENTS OF A JOBS DIAGNOSTIC

  Step 1: Basic Analysis: Establish country’s jobs needs (guides the focus of diagnostic steps 2&3):
         A. Set context: Identify the country type, the country conditions and challenges (including
              demographic trends, sector composition, fragile state etc), and establish comparators
         B. Identify relative importance of creating more, better and inclusive jobs
                     Present the changing profile of jobs, workers and employers
  Step 2: Interpret Results: Use structured inquiry to define the key jobs challenges and identify the
  underlying causes / constraints on all three dimensions:
         A. More jobs: Is the economy creating sufficient jobs relative to the working age population?
                     Growth – is growth sufficient? Is elasticity of employment to growth too low? Are jobs being
                     created in areas that encourage transformations (structural; spatial; formalization)?
                     Demand constraints to job creation – fundamentals, business environment, governance
                     Supply constraints – insufficient labor force participation, skills
         B. Better jobs: Is productivity rising? Is the proportion of working poor declining in the labor force?
                      Are new and existing jobs more productive?
                      Are people raising productivity of current jobs or reallocating time to more productive jobs?
                      Are earnings rising? Are worker vulnerabilities addressed?
         C. Inclusive jobs: Who has access to jobs?
                     Are job dynamics contributing to poverty reduction and promoting shared prosperity?
                     Are women, youth, minorities able to access job opportunities?
  Step 3: Define priorities and find possible solutions
              Look for synergies in solutions that can address multiple dimensions of jobs challenges more
9             efficiently and effectively; recognize where trade-offs need to be made, and why
THE JOBS DIAGNOSTIC’S LINKS TO THE TWIN GOALS


Step 1: Helps identify the jobs profile and jobs needs for the bottom 40%.
     Identifies where workers from poor households and the bottom 40% work; who is
     creating their jobs, and how income from labor contributes to their welfare.
     Trends in poverty, and patterns of work and remuneration for poor people over time
     Characteristics of the working poor (age, sector, gender, human capital, urban/rural)
Step 2: Examines links between jobs outcomes, growth and twin goals
     More jobs: Are the poor and bottom 40% able to expand their labor force
     participation and/or reduce under-employment? Do these jobs expand with growth?
     Better jobs: Are the jobs of the poor and the bottom 40% increasing in productivity
     and earnings over time? What is the contribution of `better jobs’ to poverty
     reduction?
     Inclusive jobs: Are the poor and bottom 40% able to access more and better jobs?
     Are the poor and bottom 40% included in the job opportunities associated with key
     economic transformations (structural change, urbanization, formalization)?
Step 3: When prioritizing opportunities and constraints to expanding job
   opportunities, use their impact on the poor and their contribution to promoting shared
   prosperity as key considerations.

 DISTRIBUTION BY AGE AND SIZE OF FIRMS IN MENA

These examples show that in common with Tunisia, Egypt has a “missing middle”, lacking in small and
    medium enterprises which could exert competitive pressure on larger and older incumbents
This was a symptom of a privilege-driven system, whereby older larger firms got political protection.

Unlike the world
population which is aging
(left side), Nigeria’s
population has stayed
young between 1990 and
2010 (right side)

This and a high fertility
rate mean Nigeria will face
a youth bulge in the labor
market for many years to
come.

This makes youth
employment and the
transition from school to
work an important jobs

     STEP 2: DIAGNOSIS: DEFINE [STRUCTURAL] JOBS CHALLENGES
     AND LOOK FOR THEIR [BINDING] CONSTRAINTS

Guided inquiry (all 3 parts should be examined):
     Step 2a: Is aggregate (and sector) growth sufficient to create more jobs?
     Does growth translate into job creation?
     Step 2b: Are new jobs better jobs? Are returns to work improving?
     Step 2c: Are expanding job opportunities inclusive?

The diagnostic provides:
   A series of questions to investigate and identify key challenges (with forthcoming guidance
  and training on data availability and tools to conduct the analysis)
  A series of potential underlying causes and constraints associated with the different jobs
  challenges: at the heart of these is the dynamic between productivity and employment.
  Teams should be selective: identifying the most important issue given step 1 findings
  The Jobs CCSA is developing with GPs, a common clustering of jobs challenges or
  ‘syndromes’ that will help guide teams to effective approaches to address jobs challenges

(This diagnostic is not designed to cover macro cycles, nor short-term policy impacts on cyclical
growth and unemployment, although lasting employment effects eg of privatization/liberalization
on labor markets may justify safety nets and employment schemes, and should be discussed).

     STEP 3: PRIORITIZE BETWEEN CONSTRAINTS TO FIND
     SOLUTIONS (REFORMS AND INVESTMENTS)

When identifying reform and investment priorities practitioners should reflect on other studies (eg SCD,
poverty, growth, ICA, FSAP, sector diagnostics), and reflect on:
    Data: the availability of data to support an evidence-based approach to solutions
    The appropriate balance of jobs needs (more, better, inclusive jobs) based on the existing profile of jobs,
    workers and employers, the priorities associated with the country typology and country conditions, and the
    demographic trends
    The political economy of reforms and private investments, the Government’s own jobs and growth
    strategies, and the politics which may be driving these, driving reforms, and the jobs constraints
    The challenges and associated constraints identified from the Jobs Diagnostic for action
            Whether appropriate to focus on SME, demand-side, supply-side, matching
            Whether structural transformation and reallocation is needed to improve productivity
            Whether barriers restrict access to better job opportunities for parts of the population
  Specificity: Whether it is right to focus solutions on a specific narrow topic or issue: eg a segment of the labor              Look for
  market, a segment of the population, a sector, or a policy trade-off or transformative investment                               synergies across
  Complementarities, synergies and trade-offs between problems and solutions: eg support reforms aimed at                         solutions that
  improving competition with transformative public and private investments (IFC).
  Future prognoses: growth paths, opportunities and the investment and skills requirements of these.                              address multiple
                                                                                                                                  jobs challenges
          Prioritization of constraints (and opportunities) for shared prosperity through jobs (which create labor incomes)

   STEP 3: EX #1 OF CROSS-CUTTING SOLUTION AREAS
   (TAKING ACCOUNT OF COUNTRY TYPOLOGY)

 EXAMPLE1: Possible jobs solutions for a low income, mineral rich mostly rural
 economy, with youth bulge, and high degree of informality: where needs are to
 raise productivity in the informal sector and expand formal job creation.
 1. Increase labor productivity for the self-employed:
              In agriculture, improve access to higher quality inputs and financial services
  Better      In informal non-farm enterprises:
  Inclusive        Emphasis on training for youth entrepreneurship
                   Regulatory approaches to enable productivity growth, expand access to
                   assets and market places, especially in secondary cities and towns

  2. Encourage diversification:
              Encourage SME start-ups, higher value products, lower barriers to entry
  More        Offset `Dutch disease effects’ through productivity gains in non-traded
  Better      sectors (including transport, energy, ICT)
  Inclusive   Deepen the labor market through skills and better matching; balance labor
              market flexibility with sufficient protections

  3. Facilitate urbanization:
  More        In secondary towns for rural services, facilitate migration to boom towns
  Better      Ensure connectivity of urban informal firms with the rest of the city
24            Promote labor market flexibility and matching
  STEP 3: EX #2 OF CROSS-CUTTING SOLUTION AREAS
  (TAKING ACCOUNT OF COUNTRY TYPOLOGY)

EXAMPLE 2: Possible short-term jobs solutions for a low income, agricultural post-
conflict country: where the priority need is to avoid slipping back into conflict.
1. Resettlement & productivity in rural areas:
             Ensure land rights, title and tenure system restores ownership equitably
Inclusive    Support irrigation eg through community managed water schemes
             Ensure inputs and planting for the new season are adequately resourced
             Remove any administrative and procedural barriers to restoring crop markets
             and decent market prices for crops (eg licenses, trade/export bans, regulatory
             constraints to trade)
  2. Create job opportunities for ex-combatants and youth:
              Promote labor intensive public works for young people in reconstruction
More
Inclusive
              Use small infrastructure projects to give youth a stake in reconstruction
              Accelerate relevant skills training for ex-combatants, including in self-
              employment in trading and transportation activities.
  3. Reconstruction and connectivity between towns and rural areas:
                 Rebuild regional markets to expand opportunities for self-employment and
 More            MSMEs (labor demand)
 Better          Re-build regional telecom and power capacity
 Inclusive
                 Re-open trade and transport corridors internally and to export markets
                 Establish open market price information through SMS services
25 • Use Jobs to strengthen social cohesion & provide a short-term peace dividend. Ensure
        coherence between short-term and sustainability
