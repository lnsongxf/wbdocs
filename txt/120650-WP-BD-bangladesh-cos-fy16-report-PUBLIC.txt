I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding
of how stakeholders in Bangladesh perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
     General Issues Facing Bangladesh
     Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
     World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
     The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
     Working with the World Bank Group
     The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Bangladesh
     Communication and Information Sharing
     Background Information


II. Methodology
From April to July 2016, 700 stakeholders of the WBG in Bangladesh were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey.
Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a Minister,
office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects or
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, local government office
or staff, bilateral/multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, private foundations, the
financial sector/private banks, NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), the media,
independent government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups,
academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the judiciary branch.

A total of 332 stakeholders participated in the survey (47% response rate). Respondents either
received the questionnaire via post or courier and returned it accordingly, received an invitation
via email and completed the questionnaire online, or completed the questionnaire with a
representative from the fielding agency.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions
are identified throughout the survey report.

The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY ’13 (response rate was 52%, N = 366). The data were weighted to reach similar
stakeholder compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable
comparisons. Note, there were insufficient numbers of respondents from bilateral/multilateral
agencies or local government in either year to be included in these analyses. Also, stakeholders
who identified themselves as “Other” in the stakeholder category options were not included in
these comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of
respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY
’13 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in this report. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (see page 86).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For all further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the
       President/Prime Minister were combined with those from the office of a Minister, the
       small number of respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with
       those from the private sector, and the few respondents from bilateral/multilateral
       agencies, private foundations, trade unions, and faith-based groups were grouped together
       into an “Other Civil Society” category. The few respondents from the office of a
       Parliamentarian and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated statistically
         similar levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY ’13
         Country Survey (weighted mean in FY ’16 = 7.1; weighted mean in FY ’13 = 7.0)1.
        Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean rating = 7.7) than respondents who do not
         collaborate with the WBG (mean rating = 6.7).
        Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were
         moderately, significantly correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
         in Bangladesh, the extent to which the WBG’s work helps to achieve development results
         and the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Bangladesh.

         levels of agreement that “Overall the World Bank Group currently plays a relevant role
         in development in Bangladesh” (weighted mean rating = 6.0) compared to respondents
         from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean rating = 5.9), but significantly higher
         levels of agreement that “The WBG’s work is aligned with what I consider the
         development priorities for Bangladesh” (FY ’16 weighted mean rating = 6.0) compared
         to respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean rating = 5.6)5.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
   Stakeholders: Respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects had the
    highest levels of agreement that “The World Bank Group disburses funds promptly” and that
    “The World Bank Group takes decisions quickly in Bangladesh” whereas respondents from the
    private sector/financial sector/private banks had significantly lower levels of agreement for the
    former and respondents from independent government intuitions had significantly lower levels
    of agreement for the latter (refer to Appendix B, page 58, for a complete breakdown).
   Location: Respondents from Dhaka Division had significantly higher levels of agreement
    that “The World Bank Group takes decisions quickly in Bangladesh” (mean rating = 5.7)
    compared to respondents from Other Areas (mean rating = 5.0).
   Collaboration: Respondents who are collaborating with the WBG had significantly higher
    levels of agreement that “The World Bank Group disburses funds promptly” (mean rating =
    5.9) and that “The World Bank Group’s conditions on its lending are reasonable” (mean
    rating = 6.0) compared to respondents who are not collaborating (mean rating = 4.4 and 5.3,
    respectively).

The WBG as an Effective Development Partner
   Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across four of these
    aspects of how the WBG operates in Bangladesh (see Appendix B, page 58). For the most
    part, respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects tended to have the
    highest ratings whereas respondents from local government and the media tended to have
    significantly lower ratings.

Appendix E: Responses to Select Questions by Year15
Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. To reduce the influence of the former, the samples
from both FY13 and FY16 were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Bangladesh or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Bangladesh, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop
more effective strategies that support development in Bangladesh.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, I FC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion.
If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank. If you feel that you do not have an
adequate amount of information on a subject, please check “Don’t know”.


PLEASE NOTE: IN SOME CASES THE SURVEY WILL ASK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF
RESPONSES. PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE ANY MORE THAN REQUESTED. IF MORE
RESPONSES ARE CHOSEN, DATA CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS.

 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Bangladesh? (Choose no more
 than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable and well targeted social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
