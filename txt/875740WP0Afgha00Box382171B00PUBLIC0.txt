                                            Summary
Economic growth slowed considerably in 2013 despite robust agricultural production as heightened
uncertainty surrounding the political and security transition led to a slump in investor and consumer
confidence. Agricultural output reached record levels for a second consecutive year in 2013 due to
favorable weather conditions, with cereals production increasing 2.7 percent over the bumper crop of
2012. On the other hand, uncertainty surrounding the political and security transition led to a slump in
investor and consumer confidence, thus resulting in a sharp slowdown in private investment and growth
in the non-agricultural sectors. Economic growth in 2013 is estimated at 3.6 percent, down sharply
from strong growth of 14.4 percent in 2012. Uncertainty remains over the security outlook after most
international forces withdraw in 2014 and over whether a cohesive and broadly accepted government
will take hold within a reasonable period of time following the April 2014 elections. Growth is projected
to remain weak in 2014. A smooth political and security transition would help restore confidence in the
economy and enable a pickup in growth in 2015.

Revenue collection weakened in 2013, while Afghanistan’s large security expenditure obligations and
high aid dependence pose the risk of crowding out important civilian operating and development
spending. After a decade of strong revenue growth, domestic revenues declined to 9.5 percent of GDP
in 2013 from 10.3 percent in 2012 and the peak of 11.6 percent in 2011. In nominal terms, revenues
amounted to Afs 109 billion in 2013, almost level with the pro-rated figure for 2012. The decline in
revenue collections is a result of the economic slowdown as well as weaknesses in enforcement in both
tax and customs administration. In order to preserve fiscal sustainability, a concerted effort will be
required going forward to improve revenue mobilization by strengthening tax and customs enforcement
and by expediting introduction and implementation of the planned value-added tax. At the same time,
given Afghanistan’s extraordinary security expenditure obligations, safeguarding important civilian
operating and development expenditures is a priority. As security expenditures have continued to grow,
austerity measures in 2013 disproportionately affected civilian expenditures and the 2014 budget
projects a considerable further increase in recurrent security expenditures.

In spite of the transition-related uncertainty and underperformance, Afghanistan will need to stay
focused on its medium term structural reform goals. These include: (i) Ensuring fiscal sustainability by
mobilizing revenue, securing grant assistance, and safeguarding non-security expenditures; (ii)
supporting inclusive and job-creating private-sector led growth by unlocking the potential of the
agriculture, services, and natural resource sectors and by tapping the potential of regional integration;
(iii) improving upon the still low levels of human capital and skills; and (iv) continuing to strengthen
institutions and governance. Reforms in these areas will be critical to reducing poverty and promoting
shared prosperity through sustainable development while helping Afghanistan become more self-reliant
in the long term.

                        Recent Economic Developments
Economic growth slowed considerably in 2013 due to increased uncertainty, despite robust
agricultural output.

After rapid growth in 2012, economic growth slowed considerably in 2013 with heightened
uncertainty leading to a sharp slowdown in the non-agriculture sectors. Real (non-opium) GDP growth
is estimated to have slowed sharply from 14.4 percent in 2012 to 3.6 percent in 2013. Growth in 2012
benefited from an exceptional agricultural harvest and rapid growth in the services sector. While
agricultural output in 2013

previous year and the highest level achieved over the past decade. Wheat production increased by 2.4
percent to 5.2 million metric tonnes, with both irrigated and rainfed production increasing further from
the surge in 2012 (see Table 1). Other cereals such as rice, maize and barley also had higher yield
compared to previous year. Given favorable precipitation particularly for the second harvest season in
the year, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) also estimates very favorable
horticulture – particularly fruits – and livestock output in 2013. While the record agriculture output in
2013 helped to counterbalance the overall confidence shock to the economy, it was up only modestly
over the bumper harvest of 2012 and was thus not sufficient to fully circumvent the overall slowdown in
GDP growth (see Figure 2).

Private investment and growth in construction, manufacturing, and services slowed considerably in
2013 due to increased uncertainty. Heightened uncertainty about the political and security transition
affected investor decisions to commit resources in Afghanistan in 2013. The number of new firm
registrations fell sharply in 2013 to its lowest level in five years, with a reduction in both local and
foreign new fixed investments
(Figure 3). The Afghanistan                  Figure 3: New firm registrations since 2003, by

price, the export value of
opiates (including drugs) increased from 11 percent of GDP in 2012 to 15 percent of GDP – or $3.1 billion
– in 2013. The UNODC estimates that the net value of the domestic market for opiates is far smaller,
worth approximately 1 percent of GDP or $200 million, compared to the net export value of opiates
which is around $2.9 billion. Despite substantial financial flows from opium production, analysis suggests
that the contribution of opium to economic growth in the past ten years has been minimal, although it is
likely to be an important source of livelihood for a segment of the rural population.

Box 1: New Poverty Estimates for Afghanistan

On February 2, 2014, the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) released the results from the latest
National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) household survey conducted in 2011-12. The results
show that the national poverty rate in Afghanistan was around 36 percent in 2011-12, the same level
measured in 2007-08 using the previous survey round (Figure 8). Furthermore, the results showed that
inequality edged up. In particular, the Gini coefficient increased to 31.6 in 2011-12 from 29.7 in 2007-
08, while the growth rate of per capita expenditure of the richest 20 percent of the population was
three times as high as that of the
poorest 20 percent as shown in                  Figure 8: Trend in poverty headcount, by

agriculture accounts for more than half of employment. It is worth noting that 2010 and 2011, the two
years preceding the 2011-12 survey, both featured negative growth in the agricultural sector. Second,
pervasive underemployment likely affects the poverty impact of growth. Afghanistan faces a daunting
demographic challenge, with around 400,000 new entrants into the labor force expected in the next few
years.

especially in the agriculture sector, and improving economic participation of women remain the key
constraints to poverty reduction and crucial milestones in promoting a more sustainable and inclusive
economic growth.

After a decade of strong revenue growth, domestic revenue collection weakened in 2012 and further
in 2013. Domestic revenues declined to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2013 down from 10.3 percent in 2012
and 11.6 percent in 2011 (Figure 9). In nominal terms, domestic revenues amounted to Afs 109 billion

analysis of the figures suggests that part of the decline in customs revenues can be attributed to lower
imports of fuel, vehicles, and other high-tariff items.

The Ministry of Finance introduced a number of measures in 2013 to stabilize revenues, reduce
leakages, and improve administration. These measures included the implementation of a computerized
risk management module, improving procedures for random post-verification of examination,
introducing post-clearance audits, salary incentives for detection of non-compliance, and an increase in
fuel valuation at customs. While the immediate effects of these measures have been modest to date,
they have likely prevented an accelerated decline. Furthermore, the authorities have submitted a Tax
Administration Law to parliament to enhance and strengthen procedures in tax offices for small,
medium and large tax payers. The law details all requirements and procedures in regard to tax
payments, documentation, dispute resolution, and tax penalties.

Public expenditures increased only very modestly in 2013 to 24.2 percent of GDP, with austerity

austerity measures put in

measures have particularly affected civilian recurrent and discretionary development spending. Civilian
recurrent spending declined to 6.6 percent of GDP in 2013 from 6.8 percent in 2012, whereas recurrent
security spending increased to 10.7 percent of GDP in 2013 from 10.3 percent in 2012. Discretionary
development spending declined by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013, while non-discretionary development
spending increased by 0.5 percent of GDP.

  The gradual move of off-budget spending into the budget is part of a medium term policy framework where
Afghanistan’s public expenditure obligations are being consolidated within the budget. The World Bank’s analysis
also indicates that on-budgeting of expenditures enhances their effectiveness and impact on economic growth and
thus helps balance the medium term drawdown in aid.

Afghanistan’s large security expenditure obligations pose the risk of crowding out important civilian
operating and development spending. With more security spending moving on budget, on-budget
security expenditures increased to 11.5 percent of GDP in 2013 from 10.4 percent in 2012. Civilian
expenditures, on the other hand, declined to 12.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from 13.4 percent in 2012, as
the government tightened public spending following the mid-year review of the budget. Spending on
sectors such as education, health, and agriculture & rural development increased modestly or held
steady, while lower spending on infrastructure and economic governance accounted for most of the
decline in civilian expenditures in 2013 (see Figure 12).

Box 2: Budgeting in a period of transition: The 2014 (1393) budget

Afghanistan’s budget for 2014 (1393) has features that traditionally have been a part of the budget, as
well as features that are unique to the current circumstances.

First, the annual budget has traditionally featured allocations for development expenditures that are far
in excess of likely spending. For example, in 2013, total budgeted development expenditure was about
$3 billion, while actual development spending turned out to be $1.45 billion. Similarly, budgeted
development expenditure for 2014 of $2.6 billion is far in excess of likely actual spending. Low
development budget execution has traditionally been a part of Afghanistan’s annual budget and
spending.

On the other hand, actual recurrent spending has traditionally been much closer to budgeted recurrent
spending. In 2013, actual recurrent spending was about 5 percent lower than budgeted because of the
austerity measures, as already discussed. In 2014, recurrent spending is budgeted to increase by 40
percent (or about $1.4 billion) compared to actual 2013 recurrent spending. Most of this increase ($1.1
billion) comes from higher recurrent security expenditures, whereas only $0.3 billion comes from higher
recurrent civilian spending. The budget assumes that domestic revenues in 2014 will be $0.5 billion
higher than in 2013. If such an increase in revenues does not materialize in 2014 (not unlikely given
heightened uncertainty) and the large budgeted increase in recurrent security spending is not
accompanied by a similar increase in grants, Afghanistan may once again find itself in a situation where

mixture of domestic
revenues and foreign grants. As more off-budget security spending moves on-budget, if the pace at
which security obligations move on-budget exceeds the pace at which civilian obligations move on-
budget, the competition from security obligations for domestic revenue and discretionary financing will
increase, with the associated risk of crowding out important civilian operating and development
spending.

The trade deficit remained large but declined slightly in 2013 as slower economic growth and demand
led to a moderation of imports. Total estimated imports – including both official and smuggling –
declined by an estimated 4 percent,
reducing the trade deficit from -42.4              Figure 14: Current account balance for

affected by slower policy implementation during the transition.

Foreign exchange reserves closed the year at nearly the same level as at end 2012. While fluctuating
throughout the year, gross foreign exchange reserves were recorded at US7.4 billion in December 2013
compared to US7.2 billion twelve months earlier. Increased fluctuations in monthly reserves – as shown
in Figure 18 – and plateauing of end-year reserves are not unexpected in light of the political and
security transition. Foreign exchange reserves could be affected by a slowdown in capital inflows and
foreign grants during the
transition period, as well as               Figure 18: Gross international reserves (billion

Monetary and banking performance indicators have still not recovered from the Kabul Bank
crisis.

Money growth picked up towards the end of the year but still remains lower than the pre-2010 levels.
Reserve money growth – which is currency-in-circulation plus required reserves of the Central Bank –
increased to 8.5 percent in November 2013, up from 2.3 percent in December 2012. Though the money
supply increased in 2013, it is still significantly lower than what it was prior to the Kabul Bank crisis in
2010, as shown in Figure 19. The Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) uses reserve money as the nominal anchor
for its open market operations. It uses foreign exchange auctions to control money supply, while
preserving a floating exchange rate regime. The Central Bank auctions, on average, around $30 million
per week to control excessive liquidity in the market. On the other hand, broad money (M2) – which is
currency in circulation plus deposits in commercial banks (including transferable/demand, savings and

The banking sector has still not fully recovered from the Kabul Bank crisis. Deposits of the banking
sector marginally increased to Afs 198 billion ($3.4 billion) in November 2013, up from Afs 187 billion
($3.6 billion) in December 2012. In percent of GDP, total deposits of the banking sector have in fact
declined from 16.1 percent in 2012 to 15.5 percent in 2013. Lending to the private sector, on the other
hand, has remained steady at around 4 percent of GDP or $820 million. Both total loans and loan-to-
deposit ratio remain sharply lower than the pre-crisis levels, as indicated in Figure 21. Lower lending is
also impacted, to a certain degree, by increased perceptions of uncertainty by businesses and lower
non-agricultural growth that lead to reduced demand for credit.

The privatization of the New Kabul Bank is on-going. In early 2013, the Ministry of Finance rejected the
only bid received from a local bidder due to the disqualification of the technical proposal. The
privatization of the bank was relaunched later in the year, with a UAE-based and a US firm qualifying as
approved bidders. The Ministry of Finance announced in December 2013 that Kru Capital won the bid
for New Kabul Bank with a US$28.5 million offer (including US$20 million for capital injection). This bid
now needs to be approved by the Cabinet, with the approval still pending.

            Economic Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
Economic growth is projected to remain weak at 3.2 percent in 2014 due to heightened uncertainty
and lower agriculture output. Uncertainty surrounding the political and security transition is expected
to persist through most of 2014, resulting in continued weakness in private investment and growth in
the non-agricultural sectors. A smooth political and security transition would help restore confidence in
the economy. At the same time, lower agriculture output is anticipated in 2014 as the winter
precipitation has been assessed as less favorable. Taking into account the bumper harvest in 2013,
agriculture output in 2014 is expected to be lower than in 2013, thus placing a further drag on growth
prospects for 2014. Under these assumptions, real GDP growth is projected at 3.2 percent in 2014. In
this context, public investment expenditures on essential infrastructure can provide an important prop
for economic activity during this period of heightened uncertainty and also contribute to Afghanistan’s
medium term growth prospects.

In the medium term, post-transition growth is projected at about 5 percent per year during 2015-16.
This is less than the average growth of 9.4 percent per year during 2003-12 that was fueled by the surge
in international aid and security spending. The post-transition growth outlook is contingent upon a
relatively stable security environment, with agriculture and extractive industries likely to be among the
significant sectors driving growth. Agriculture accounts for about a quarter of GDP and is also linked
closely to other parts of the economy, such as food and beverages (which account for almost all of
manufacturing), and parts of transport and retail. Afghanistan has the potential to build on this

other higher value-added products. This will require investments in irrigation and extension services to
improve capacity, as well as efforts to build and improve downstream agro-processing activities. On the
other hand, the extractive industries sector currently accounts for a very small share of GDP, but has
significant potential in light of Afghanistan’s deposits of copper, iron ore, and hydrocarbons. Unlocking
this potential will require progress on the legislative framework as well as securing financing for the
necessary infrastructure.

The medium term growth outlook is subject to serious risks which will need to be carefully managed.
Significant uncertainty surrounds the outcomes of the political and security transition in 2014. The
fragile security environment has been a considerable constraint to private investment and growth.
Continued violence, economic crime and systemic corruption also have often undermined progress in
Afghanistan’s governance and state-building agenda. Much will depend, therefore, on Afghanistan’s
success in achieving peace, stability and reconciliation. Without this, the growth prospects discussed
above are unlikely to materialize.

Given the recent weakness in fiscal revenue performance, a concerted effort will be required from the
authorities to improve revenue mobilization. The medium term fiscal framework calls for an increase
in revenues from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 11.1 percent in 2015 and 13.8 percent in 2018 (or just
under one percentage point of GDP per year). In light of recent weaknesses in collections, the increase
in revenues will require a concerted effort on the part of the Afghan authorities to (i) reduce leakages
and strengthen customs administration; and (ii) expedite the introduction and implementation of the
planned value-added tax (VAT). The natural resources sector also has the potential to contribute to
revenues in the medium term, but the timeline for this has become more uncertain in light of recent
developments in the sector.

Budget expenditures are expected to continue to rise from about 24 percent of GDP in 2013 to about
30 percent of GDP by 2016. The increase in budget expenditures is largely a result of more spending
moving on budget from previously being undertaken directly by donors. Afghanistan has considerable
public expenditure needs in the areas of security, service delivery, building essential infrastructure, and
operations and maintenance (O&M). Although more detailed analysis of public expenditures in needed,
there appears to be limited space to adjust expenditures without adversely affecting growth prospects
and social outcomes. The resulting financing needs of the budget are, therefore, likely to remain
substantial for the foreseeable future. Moreover, channeling a greater share of development assistance
through on-budget expenditures is expected to enhance the medium term economic impact.

Donors have committed to cover the budget financing gap, although these funds will be contingent on
satisfactory progress on the TMAF, of which an important indicator is increasing domestic revenue.
The July 2012 donor meeting in Tokyo pledged $16 billion in development aid for Afghanistan over
2012-16. Together with earlier pledges on the security side, this means annual aid of about $8 billion—
roughly equally divided between civil and security aid. This would cover the projected budget financing
gap and allow the authorities to progress towards development and infrastructure targets. However,
these funds will only be made fully available if the Government makes satisfactory progress on the
TMAF. An important indicator in the TMAF is the increase in domestic revenue; to this end the

                                                                                              19 | P a g e
Government committed to increasing revenues over the medium term. The necessary improvements in
revenue collection can only be achieved in Afghanistan by developing the mining sector, fostering
private sector development, broadening the tax base and strengthening enforcement to reduce
leakages. The current weakness in revenues therefore poses not only risks to long-term fiscal
sustainability but also to the achievement of TMAF targets. As such, a concerted effort on the part of
the Afghan authorities to regaining momentum in revenue generation and improve the current revenue
outlook is of critical importance.

Structural Policies for the Medium Term
As Afghanistan moves forward with the unprecedented security, political and economic transition, its
overall strategic goals are to achieve sustainable and equitable development while becoming more
self-reliant by 2025. These strategic goals are articulated in the Government’s document Strategic
Vision for the Transformation Decade presented at the Tokyo Conference in 2012. A key part of
addressing these goals would be to create jobs to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. In order
to achieve its strategic goals, Afghanistan will need to address challenges in four key areas: (i)
safeguarding sustainability by mobilizing revenue and securing grant assistance; (ii) supporting inclusive
and job-creating post-transition growth by unlocking the potential of the agriculture and natural
resource sectors and by tapping the potential of regional integration; (iii) improving upon the low levels
of human capital and skills; and (iv) continuing to strengthen institutions and governance.

Maintaining macroeconomic sustainability in Afghanistan’ highly aid dependent environment will
require improving revenue mobilization while also securing grant assistance to meet its considerable
financing needs. Afghanistan will continue to require substantial grant assistance for the foreseeable
future. The projected total financing gap, while declining from more than 40 percent of GDP in 2012,
will remain above 20 percent of GDP through 2025. In addition to securing the necessary grant
financing, Afghanistan will also need to improve its revenue outlook. This will require a concerted effort
to implementing its reform program supported by the IMF, ARTF, and IDA, which includes: (i) measures
to reduce leakages and strengthen customs and tax administration; (ii) introduction and subsequent
widening of the planned VAT; and (iii) progress on the legislative and regulatory framework for the
extractive industries sector.

Supporting inclusive growth to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in the post-transition
period will require ensuring that steady growth is accompanied by greater job creation. Poverty levels
remain high in Afghanistan. A number of factors could affect the impact of growth on poverty reduction
and the prospects for raising incomes of the bottom two quintiles of the population. First, the volatility
of agricultural growth could considerably affect prospects for poverty reduction since agriculture
accounts for more than half of employment. Second, limited overall employment generation and
pervasive underemployment could limit the poverty impact of growth. Going forward, reducing poverty
and boosting shared prosperity will require ensuring that growth is steady and that it is accompanied by
greater job creation. With Afghanistan facing a demographic shift where about 400,000 new workers



                                                                                             20 | P a g e
are entering the labor force each year, generating jobs will be critical to improving incomes of the
bottom quintiles of the population and reducing poverty and vulnerability of the population.

Agriculture is highly relevant to poverty reduction and job creation and improved irrigation should
reduce volatility in the sector. Agriculture generates more than 50 percent of employment and 84
percent of the poor live in rural areas. However, poor irrigation means that agricultural production is
also highly volatile. Furthermore, employment in agriculture is characterized by small family businesses,
often producing merely for subsistence and seldom providing enough resources to sustain families
throughout the year. Leveraging the potential of agriculture to create better jobs and reduce poverty
will require investments in irrigation, extension services to improve the capacity of farmers, and
progressively tapping opportunities to move into higher value-added products. Afghanistan has already
achieved some success in introducing smart agricultural techniques in grain production—for example,
the pilots on the System of Rice Intensification—which are likely to yield jobs, higher outputs, and
require lower water and other inputs at the same time as delivering several environmental benefits.

The mining sector has significant potential for growth with modest employment impact, although
there is a chance to enhance the impact of the sector through the resource corridor approach.
Progress in establishing a favorable legal and regulatory environment in the mining sector should lead to
significant growth of the sector if financing for related infrastructure investments can also be identified.
Even so, the direct impact of mining on employment is likely to be modest, with the best-case scenario
generating about 100,000 to 125,000 jobs over the next ten years. The resource corridor approach,
however, provides an opportunity to enhance the impact of the sector. This approach rests on the idea
of using mining development as an anchor for the infrastructure development that underpins the
viability of the other sustainable activities. It combines necessary investment in mining infrastructure
with the enhancement of objectives in local livelihood, social and environmental ideals and governance.
This involves strategic planning and investment in supply chains which produce spillovers to other
economic activities and synergies with private-sector investment.

Tapping the potential of regional integration could also become an important contributor to growth.
Afghanistan lies at the crossroads of rapidly growing and resource rich economies in Central, South, and
West Asia. A number of regional energy transit initiatives will require the direct participation of
Afghanistan. These include the CASA-1000 project intended to carry Central Asian power to Pakistan
and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline intended to carry Central Asian gas to
Pakistan and India. In addition, Afghanistan can tap the potential of growing transit trade in the region.
Taking advantage of regional integration will require investments in infrastructure, improving customs
facilities, and strengthening trade agreements.

Streamlining the business environment is an important priority for Afghanistan. Afghanistan ranks
164th (out of 189 countries) in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2014 report. While the 2014 report
recognizes a number of investment climate reforms (including reducing the time and cost of starting a
business and implementing a unified collateral registry within the Central Bank), recent steps taken by
AISA and the Ministry of Commerce (MoCI) point toward risks of reform reversals in other areas. In
particular, MoCI has recently taken steps to reverse the merger of the licensing and central business

                                                                                               21 | P a g e
registry departments, which would reverse an important reform to unify and streamline the process of
issuing trade licenses. Second, in August 2013, AISA revised its fee structure to increase licensing fees
for several sub-categories of investment (consulting and construction). Immediately addressing these
risks of reform reversals is an important priority within the overall goal of streamlining the business
environment.

Improving literacy, skills and education in Afghanistan, especially in rural areas, is a key priority to
meeting its development objectives. The stock of skills available to the domestic labor market in
Afghanistan is extremely low in spite of significant improvements in school enrollment rates and
education achievement over the past decade. The recent gains have only attempted to keep pace with
lost opportunities during decades of conflict. Only one out of four Afghans aged 16 or above is able to
read and write or has completed some formal level of schooling. Low human capital reduces the rate of
return on physical capital, diminishes the profitability of investments, the adoption of new technologies
as well as the structural transformation of the economy. It is therefore paramount that investments in
education at all levels remain a priority in Afghanistan’s development strategy.

Finally, meeting Afghanistan’s development objectives will require continued strengthening of
institutions and governance. Given Afghanistan’s governance environment, there is greater risk of a
natural resource curse. A failure to credibly address transparency, accountability, and political economy
risks—especially the balance of revenue flows between the central level and provinces and communities
in which the mines are located—could result in a further deterioration of the governance and security
situation. But beyond mining-related considerations, the challenges to establishing good governance
are vast and progress is frequently undermined by the fragile security situation. The government’s
decisiveness to strengthen the rule of law, public financial management systems, fight pervasive
corruption, improve regulatory oversight and enhance the capacity for public service delivery will be
critical in achieving Afghanistan’s development objectives.

IDA and the ARTF:

1. The International Development Association (IDA) and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
   (ARTF) are the main sources of World Bank financing of country priorities in Afghanistan. The ARTF is
   nearly five-fold larger than IDA and has been managed by the Bank since its creation in 2002; it is a
   key vehicle for providing Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing. The
   ARTF also plays a critical role as a forum for policy dialogue between Government and donors. A
   2012 external review of the ARTF concluded that the ARTF is “fit for purpose” and stands as a best-
   practice trust fund.

2. The World Bank is respected by Government and donors for its analytical and research products
   through economic sector work and technical assistance. In an environment where policy advice and
   assistance is essential, work in this area provides support for Government and donor decision
   making. It is expected that the World Bank will continue to play a leading role in terms of policy
   advice to Government through targeted, often cross-sectoral, analytic work. The Bank’s work on
   Transition Economics and Resource Corridors, together with its poverty analysis, has been
   instrumental in informing decisions of the Government and the donor community in this challenging
   transition period.

3. Since 2002, IDA has committed a total of $2.7 billion in grants (83 percent) and credits (17 percent)
   in Afghanistan. Thirty-six development and emergency-reconstruction projects and four budget-
   support operations have been committed as of end-February 2014. In addition, the ARTF has
   generated $6.94 billion from 33 donors, and committed $3.06 billion for the government’s recurrent
   costs and $3.07 billion for government investments programs. At end-February 2014 the active IDA
   portfolio was worth $7.30 billion and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth $1.83 billion.

4. ARTF and IDA projects are managed with the same attention. All projects are eligible for processing
   under the Bank’s Special Considerations for fragile states and emergencies (incorporated into OP
   10.00). In practice this has proved most useful to improve flexibility post-approval as all projects are
   processed under regular review procedures in order to ensure quality at entry. All Bank (IDA and
   ARTF) funds are channeled through the government’s budget and project accounting and reporting
   occurs at the central level.

5. In fiscal year 2014, the World Bank Board approved two new IDA-financed projects totaling $100
   million, plus additional financing for an existing project. The new projects included $50 million for
   the Development Policy Grant and $50 million for Access to Finance; the Financial Sector Rapid
   Response project received $6.7 million in additional financing. A regional project – CASA-1000 – was
   approved in March 2014 by the World Bank Group’s Board of Executive Directors for total grant and
   credit financing of $526.5 million. Of the total project financing for CASA-1000, Afghanistan receives
   $316.5 million in the form of an IDA grant. The IDA commitments of $220 million in FY14 ensure
   that IDA-16 is fully utilized.

6. In addition, in fiscal 2014 (through March 31), the ARTF approved $74.8 million in recurrent cost
   financing (of which $30 million was for recurrent cost baseline financing and $44.8 million for the
   Incentive Program) and $380 million for Investment Window financing, including the Second

                                                                                              23 | P a g e
    Education Quality Improvement Program ($125 million), the Third Emergency National Solidarity
    Project ($200 million), the CASA Community Support Project ($40 million) and the Non-formal
    Approach to Training, Education and Jobs in Afghanistan ($15 million).


IFC and MIGA operations in Afghanistan:

7. IFC is following an integrated advisory and investment strategy focused on improving the
   investment climate, building capacity, and supporting selective investments in sectors with high
   development impact and job creation. IFC’s investment portfolio in Afghanistan has more than
   doubled since FY08 - from around $58 million to about $131 million to date. Currently, IFC’s
   portfolio includes two investments in the telecommunication sector (MTN - a joint project with
   MIGA-$60 million and Roshan-$65 million), one investment in the hotel sector (TPS-$3 million), and
   two operations in financial markets (First Microfinance Bank-$2 million equity, Afghanistan
   International Bank - trade facility). These investments have had a strong impact (in terms of access
   to finance and outreach), particularly in the microfinance and telecommunication sectors. Through
   the project with the First Microfinance Bank (FMFB)--the first licensed private sector microfinance
   bank in Afghanistan, IFC was able to reach over 64,000 borrowers (more than 25 % of the current
   market penetration) – 16 % of whom were women. Similarly, IFC has had significant impact in the
   telecommunication sector by improving mobile phone access and services to the poor through the
   investment in Mobile Telephone Networks (MTN) and more recently in Roshan Telecom. Going
   forward, IFC is looking to expand its investment program in Afghanistan in the areas of
   infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, and services.

8. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group has $155 million of
   gross exposure in Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business projects. MIGA recently
   launched the “Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility” that will provide a first loss cover in
   fragile and conflict states, including Afghanistan. This will allow MIGA to greatly expand its work in
   these countries, while still meeting prudential limits. MIGA is currently supporting three projects in
   Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with the IFC in the telecoms sector (MTN) and the other
   two are MIGA-only (cashmere exporter, Traitex Industry and Mido Dairy).
