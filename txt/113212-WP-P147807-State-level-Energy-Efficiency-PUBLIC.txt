Executive Summary
India is currently one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. Sustaining a high growth rate is
believed to be critical for India to alleviate poverty in the country, since it feeds more than a billion people.
Energy, being a key enabler of a country’s economic growth and development , has witnessed a significant rise in
its consumption in India. In 2013 about 528.34 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) were consumed, making
India the third largest consumer of energy in the world —more than 70% of which is supplied by fossil sources.
Increasing energy demand naturally strains the country’s resources and impacts the environment. This
warrants decoupling the country’s economic growth and energy demand. This is also echoed through India’s
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution submitted in the run-up to the Paris Climate Conference, where
the government has highlighted energy conservation as a key mitigation strategy. It seeks to achieve total
avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW and fuel savings of around 23 million tons per year through the
National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE). However, this requires concerted effort at the
central and state levels, especially considering the existing federal governance architecture where many
subjects, including electricity, fall under the jurisdictions of both the center and the state.

Rationale and Objectives
In the current structure of India’s energy efficiency and electricity governance framework, states have an
important role to play to achieve the desired developmental goals. This is clearly spelled in the Energy
Conservation Act (EC) 2001, where the states are required to develop and enforce critical energy efficiency
standards and regulations, build institutional capacity, formulate policies, plan and implement projects, extend
financial support, and create self-sustaining markets for energy efficiency. The distribution vertical of the
electricity value chain, where the majority of energy efficiency potential (both supply and demand side) exists,
lies entirely with the states according to the Electricity Act (EA) 2003. Moreover, since the business of
electricity generation, transmission, and distribution is regulated, the state electricity regulatory commissions
are poised to play a crucial role in guiding and regulating the electrical energy efficiency activities in the states.
With the energy efficiency agenda gaining traction and momentum in India, there is a need to continuously
evaluate institutional capacity, policies, programs, and markets at the state level to identify best practices and
promote cross learning. Comparative benchmarking is a proven methodology to evaluate states and give
recommendations for improving their governance performance. This study aims to develop a framework and
methodology for the evaluation of state’s readiness for energy efficiency implementation. The study adopts an
index-based evaluation of individual states to benchmark their readiness. The benchmarking across the states
will serve as a comparative reference point for the states to measure, monitor, and evaluate the chosen
indicators that best depict the energy efficiency implementation readiness.
To benchmark Indian states, this study has considered 28 states (excluding the newly formed state of
Telangana) and the National Capital Territory: Delhi.

Methodology
The framework for establishing the “energy efficiency implementation readiness index” consists of 11 readiness
factors under three broad categories: (a) policy and incentives (b) market maturity, and (c) institutional
capacity. These 11 factors are further evaluated by a suite of evidence indicators that are both qualitative and
quantitative. The qualitative evidence indicators capture whether a specific policy, mandate, incentive,
institution, financing mechanism, and other characteristics exist under each of the readiness factors. The
quantitative evidence indicators aim to assess the energy efficiency potential already unlocked and also reflect
the current progress towards implementing important energy efficiency measures or programs. Recognizing
states’ performance in project implementation has significance since the states having prior implementation
experience are expected to be better prepared to scale up intervention in the future.
The 11 readiness factors chosen for evaluation, as presented in Table 1, reflect the various aspects of the state’s

Like any index-based benchmarking exercise, this evaluation also depends heavily on data or information. Most
of the information or data used for the assessment of states against evidence indicators has been sourced from
publicly available sources. None of the information collected or compiled for the purposes of this report has
been vetted by state government officials. For maintaining consistency while assessing the states’ readiness, the
exercise has considered states’ actions recorded until December 2015, unless otherwise mentioned in the
report.

Readiness Assessment
The following sections present the benchmark of the performance of the states under each of the three
readiness categories: policy and incentives, market maturity, and institutional capacity. Here, the readiness of
individual states is expressed in percentage of the total index-based score in each category.

Policy and Incentives
This readiness category comprising of six readiness factors broadly captures the state of play in the states
concerning the existence of specific policies, mandates or incentive mechanisms.

Key Findings
This section highlights the main outcomes of the state level energy efficiency readiness assessment under each
of the six readiness factors of the category “policy and incentives.”

State Plan for Energy Efficiency
About 14 states have officially adopted a sector-specific energy efficiency action plan. Most of these states have
included the energy efficiency action plan as part of the State’s Action Plan on Climate Ch ange (SAPCC).
Andhra Pradesh has developed an energy efficiency action plan as part of the Power for All program recently
launched by the Government of India. None of the states have enacted legislation backing the energy efficiency
action plan. Kerala and Karnataka are the only states that have identified energy savings targets. However,
these targets are yet to be officially adopted. Some other states have mentioned energy-saving potential without
setting any target to achieve them.

Mandates for Utilities
Regarding energy efficiency intervention in power transmission and distribution (T&D), SERCs in all states
have given targets or issued directives to utilities to reduce T&D losses in power distribution. The regulators
have also extended incentives for utilities to achieve the targets.
Demand-side management (DSM), a promising frontier to improve energy efficiency in the power sector, has
attracted certain initiatives at the state level. As of April 2016, 19 states have issued DSM regulations, which
provide a framework for undertaking DSM measures. Andhra Pradesh deserves special mention in this regard.
In spite of the absence of any announced DSM regulation, the state has witnessed several utility-driven DSM
measures thanks to the initiatives taken by the state regulator and DISCOMs (distribution companies). Up to
now, none of the state DSM regulations specifies any energy saving targets through utility-driven DSM or offers
any incentive to DISCOMs to take DSM measures. The regulations only allow provisions DISCOMs to recover
the DSM-related costs by accounting them in the annual revenue requirement (ARR) estimates.
As far as introducing guidelines on evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and M&V of utility-driven DSM
measures is concerned, Maharashtra and Punjab are the only states in the country that have acted upon it.
International experience suggests that mandating utilities to adopt integrated energy resource planning (IRP) is
one of the important enabling factors for promoting utility-driven DSM programs in a country. However, none
of the existing national policies, acts, or regulations in India (read EC Act 2001; EA 2003; National Electricity
Policy 2005) has promoted mandating utilities to adopt IRP in their investment plans.

Mandates for Public Institutions
As far as public procurement of energy efficient end-use applications are concerned, the index-based evaluation
finds that in 15 states, the governments have issued circulars on the procurement of star-rated appliances: split
ACs, frost-free refrigerators, ceiling fans, and water heaters for use in public buildings. States where such
circulars have not been traced have failed to score under the relevant sub-indicator. Few states have made it
mandatory for municipalities to incorporate energy efficiency measures in their services. For instance, the
government of Himachal Pradesh has directed all urban local bodies (ULBs) in the state to install energy-
efficient streetlighting. The study also found that none of the states has made it mandatory for state road
transport corporations to improve fuel economy in public vehicles.

Incentives to MSMEs
The assessment reveals that initiatives to encourage energy efficiency among MSMEs are limited. These
initiatives may include giving fiscal incentives for investing in energy efficiency, recognizing selected MSMEs
for their energy-saving efforts, and offering assistance to identify energy efficiency opportunities.

                                                                                                               12
The state of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu reportedly
have energy efficiency investment promotion schemes for MSMEs. One of the initiatives is conducting
walkthrough energy audits and preparing feasibility studies for certain MSME clusters to identify energy
efficiency opportunities. Some states also provide monetary assistance (such as a subsidy for energy audits) to
MSMEs to undertake energy audit exercises and/or prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs).

Incentives for Large-Scale Energy Users
In India, one can see center-driven energy efficiency initiatives targeted at large-scale energy users, namely, the
Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme. However, although section 18 of the EC Act includes provisions
allowing states to devise any energy efficiency regulation for large-scale energy consumers, hardly any state
government has utilized them. Only Kerala and Maharashtra have offered some kind of financial incentives to
these consumers for taking up energy efficiency activities.

Implementation of Energy Conservation Building Codes
The readiness index result gives a fair impression of state-wise status of energy conservation policy thrust in the
buildings sector. While the EC Act directs the states to amend the Energy Conservation Building Codes (ECBCs)
and issue notification for enforcement, only six states —Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan,
and Uttarakhand—have notified the ECBC, whereas 13 states have amended it, but are yet to notify it.1 In some
cases, the ECBC directives include disclosure of building energy usage annually. However, currently no ECBC-
compliant building is reported in any of these states, and it is difficult to confirm the actual procedure followed
to enforce the building code. Moreover, none of the states has made it mandatory to submit a disclosure of the
property’s energy usage at the time of sale or leasing of building.
Some states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Sikkim) have adopted an energy
labeling or rating system (GRIHA or BEE star labeling) for building certification. 2 Some of these states
reportedly offer incentives in the form of tax concessions or additional free-of-cost floor area ratio (FAR) to
GRIHA-compliant buildings3. Few cities or ULBs (such as Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh; Pune, Pimpri, and
Mumbai in Maharashtra; Jaipur in Rajasthan; Noida in Uttar Pradesh; and Kolkata in West Bengal) also give
incentives to GRIHA-compliant buildings.
It is found that in states where SERCs give energy efficiency targets to utilities with respect to power generation
and T&D, those targets are usually associated with some kind of penalty mechanism in the case of
noncompliance. For instance, SERC considers the target level of T&D loss in estimating ARR for the DISCOM,
even though the latter could not achieve the target. This implies that a part of the power purchase cost for the
volume of electricity lost in T&D is not accounted for in the ARR, which is therefore a loss of revenue to the
DISCOM. Similar penalization mechanism is followed if the utility is given a target at the generation side.
However, such penalty mechanism is not universally applicable across all states.
As far as introducing guidelines on evaluation of cost-effectiveness and measurement and verification (M&V) of
utility-driven DSM measures is concerned, Maharashtra and Punjab are the only states in the country that have
acted upon it.
A review of the retail tariff orders indicates that in almost all states, the tariff structures include an off-peak
time rebate or time of day (ToD) tariff as an instrument to reduce peak load. However, currently, such a tariff
rebate is applicable only for industrial consumers.
International experience suggests that mandating utilities to adopt IRP is one of the key enabling factors for
driving utility-driven DSM programs in a country. However, none of the existing national policies, acts, or
regulations in India (that is, EC Act 2001; EA 2003; or National Electricity Policy 2005) has promoted
mandating utilities to adopt IRP in their investment plans.

Market Maturity
This readiness category comprising three readiness factors reflects the status of enabling factors, such as
financing mechanisms or consumer tools available in the states, and the energy efficiency potential currently
harnessed, which can be scaled up in the near future.

Key Findings
This section highlights the key takeaways of the state-level energy efficiency readiness assessment under each of
the three readiness factors of the category “market maturity.”

Information or Tools Available to Consumers
All the states are typically guided by the electricity supply codes that specify the standards and norms for
providing electricity usage information to consumers. Currently, none of the states inform the consumers about
the electricity usage levels of peer groups or make any such comparison to benchmark usage levels. Also, there
is no regulation that requires utilities to furnish such information by defining what constitutes peer groups and
what indicators are to be adopted.
With regard to empowering consumers through smart features in power distribution, other than in Delhi, the
facility for real-time feedback to customers about their energy usage or managing consumption remotely is yet
to be implemented beyond pilot project scale in the country. 4,5

Energy Efficiency Potential and Implementation Experience
India has made significant headway in implementing DSM programs, largely driven by Energy Efficiency
Services Limited (EESL), a Government of India undertaking. The most significant initiative is EESL’s DSM -
based DELP (UJALA Distribution scheme), which involves large-scale replacement of incandescent bulbs with
self-ballasted LED lamps in the residential sector. As of May 6, 2016, 16 states have undertaken the DELP with
varying degree of LED lamp penetration among consumers. The Agricultural DSM Program (AgDSM) and
Energy Efficient Street Lighting Program are two other major DSM programs currently pursued throughout
India. While performing the evaluation of the states, this study has taken into consideration those initiatives
that have been undertaken since 2010 through utility-driven DSM programs whereby old inefficient agricultural
pumpsets are replaced by BEE star-rated pumps. As of February 2016, these states include Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. With respect to energy-efficient streetlighting programs, states that
have started implementing them include Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala,
Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh.
Recently EESL has launched the energy-efficient domestic fan program, which, until May 6, 2016, was limited
to two states: Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
The state nodal agencies in nine states, with support from the Government of India, have started implementing
the solar irrigation pump program. They are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.

Financing Mechanisms for Energy Efficiency Activities
The evaluation outcome reflects that many states are yet to adequately consider energy efficiency in making
fiscal policies. One can see limited number of financial instruments applied in implementing energy efficiency
measures. Financing energy efficiency measures through energy service contracts (ESCO model) is one of them,
which has been getting traction in recent years. Cost recovery through tariffs on utilities is also one of the
preferred financing options. Here, expenditures incurred for adopting energy efficiency measures by the
utilities are accounted for in the latter’s ARR as stated in their retail tariff orders.
The states of Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Punjab have capital subsidy
schemes for energy efficiency projects. On-bill financing, a new breed of financing model for energy efficiency
projects, has been tried in such states as Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and
Punjab for funding DSM-based DELP among households. Here, the costs of the LED lamps distributed to
households are included in the monthly electricity bills of the consumers.

Institutional Capacity
This readiness category, comprising two readiness factors, intends to capture the existing institutional
framework and oversight systems in the states.

Key Findings
This section highlights the key findings of the state-level energy efficiency readiness assessment under each of
the two readiness factors of the category “institutional capacity .”

Institutional Framework and Capacity
In the current framework of energy efficiency governance, SDAs have been vested with the responsibility of
formulating energy efficiency strategies or policies at the state level, according to the provisions of the EC Act
(2001). It is interesting to note that the profiles of the SDAs vary greatly among the states. Out of the 34 SDAs,
14 are renewable energy development agencies, 9 are power departments of state governments, 6 are electrical
inspectorate offices, 3 are electricity DISCOMs, and 2 are societies registered under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860. Clearly, most SDAs have been given the mandate of energy efficiency governance as an additional
mission or portfolio. This creates a sense of competition between the energy efficiency and other mainstream
functions of the SDAs for internal resources.

Only the SDA of Andhra Pradesh’s (State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM)) has been constitut ed with the
sole mandate of promoting energy efficiency in the state.6 The Energy Management Centre (EMC), Kerala’s
SDA, is also unique in this regard. Constituted in 1996 as an autonomous body under the Department of Power,
Government of Kerala, its primary mandate includes promotion of energy conservation in the state. 7
It is interesting to note, however, that Section 18 of the EC Act empowers a state to direct the regulation of the
energy consumption standards for equipment and appliances . However, Kerala is the only state that has
exercised this power; it has issued the Energy Conservation (Energy Consumption Standards for Equipment
and Appliances) Directions, 2015. Otherwise, currently this function is carried out by the BEE at the central
level.
Alternatively, while the EC Act (2001) directs the states to amend the ECBC and issue notification for
enforcement, only six states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand) have
notified the ECBC.

Monitoring and Evaluation System
In case SERC sets energy efficiency targets to utilities in power generation and T&D, the energy savings or
related indicators, such as SHR and T&D losses, are measured and reported to SERC at the time of annual
performance reviews.
Load research studies holds strategic importance as they help characterize the end-use electricity consumption,
identify strategic demand side measures, and develop action plans to formulate and design possible DSM
interventions. Load research studies were reportedly being carried out by one or more utilities in 23 states as of
April 2016.
Empanelling energy consultants or auditors is one of the important steps SDAs should take to create an
ecosystem for scaling up energy conservation efforts in a state. This state-wise assessment on energy efficiency
implementation readiness has identified 12 states that have adopted mechanisms for the empanelment of
energy auditors. Other states do not have a publicized system for empanelling these players.
The ECBCs notified by the states should clearly state the compliance or M&V protocol for proper enforcement.
However, there are cases where ECBC directives lack clear-cut guidelines on compliance–roles and
responsibilities of the authorities involved are not clearly mentioned, leaving enough ambiguity. Moreover,
compliance requirement involving verification by independent third parties is not included in the ECBC
directives in all the six states where ECBC is notified.
Figure 3 showcases the benchmark of the performance of the states in percentage scores, under the readiness
category “institutional capacity.”

Recommended Action Points
From the assessment, one could identify key intervention areas where most states are found lagging and that
warrant further action. Based on this, the study has put forward a set of key recommendations or action points
(refer to Table 3) for the states to improve their readiness for scaling up energy efficiency activities. Because of
the varied energy efficiency scenarios and economic profiles among the states, proposing a separate set of
recommendations for each state is beyond the scope of this exercise. It is also to be underlined that prioritizing
these actions depends on the states’ development objectives and need. In the cases where interventions at
national level are deemed important, the following recommendations also highlight those action-points.

1. Economic and Energy Use
Paradigms of Indian States: Need for
Local Approach towards Energy
Efficiency
India is currently one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. Sustaining a high growth rate is
believed to be critical for India to alleviate poverty in the country, since it feeds more than a billion people.
Energy, being a key enabler of a country’s economic growth and development, has witnessed a significant rise in
its consumption in India. In 2013 about 528.34 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) were consumed, making
India the third largest consumer of energy in the world—more than 70% of which is supplied by fossil sources.8
Increasing energy demand naturally strains the country’s resources and impacts the environment. This
warrants decoupling the country’s economic growth and energy demand. This is also echoed through India’s
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, which was submitted in the run-up to the Paris Climate
Conference, where the government highlighted energy conservation as an important mitigation strategy. It
seeks to achieve a total avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW and fuel savings of around 23 million tons per
year through the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE). However, this requires concerted
effort at the central and state levels, especially considering the existing federal governance architecture where
many subjects, such as electricity, economic and social planning, and industrial development, fall under the
jurisdictions of both the center and the state.
India consists of 29 states, including the recently formed Telangana, the National Capital Territory of Delhi and
six union territories (UTs). It exemplifies a myriad of variations in demography, geographic and climatic
patterns, and economic profiles across the length and breadth of the country. It is therefore impractical to take
a “one-size-fits-all” approach in solving the problems of the country. It is imperative to consider policies,
programs, or activities tailor-made for local situations. Otherwise, the possibility of failure in achieving the
targeted objectives will be high. To gain a necessary understanding of India’s energy efficiency scenario, it is
therefore not sufficient to limit the understanding to the central level; one has to endeavor to have knowledge of
the situation at the state level.
This chapter intends to give a snapshot of the state-level variations in economic and energy use profiles by
highlighting some important parameters: highest sectoral shares in electricity use and gross state domestic
product (GSDP), per capita electricity consumption, and energy intensity related to electricity consumption or
GSDP (refer to Figures 4–7).

2. India’s Energy Efficiency
Governance Framework and the
States’ Roles
In India, both supply and demand sides are important to ensure the energy efficiency is advanced in a
comprehensive manner. Supply-side energy efficiency (SSEE) ensures that the extraction, mining, production,
and transmission and distribution (T&D) of energy commodities are conducted efficiently. Demand-side energy
efficiency ensures that the end-use of energy (for example, energy consumption by appliances, buildings,
industries, and vehicles) is efficient as a result of technological performance and effective energy management
through operational or behavioral changes.
The supply side of energy is governed by both central and state agencies,9 whereas the demand side is
predominantly governed by the states.

Energy Conservation Act, 2001
Without discriminating between any form or source of energy, the Energy Conservation (EC) Act, 2001, defines
the governing framework for efficient use of energy and its conservation in India. Under the EC Act, the central
and state governments are provided with multiple functions and statutory powers to facilitate, coordinate,
regulate, and enforce efficient use of energy and its conservation. The EC Act provides a statutory basis for
regulating energy consumption and enforcing energy efficiency standards among any energy users notified as
designated consumers (DCs), buildings or building complexes, and energy-consuming equipment or appliances.
The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has been set up under the EC Act as a central nodal agency with specific
powers and functions to implement provisions at the national level. The EC Act also required the state
governments to designate an agency for the implementation of the functions assigned to the states. In this
regard, the state designated agencies (SDAs) for energy efficiency have been notified in the 28 states and 6
union territories. The box highlights the key roles of the state governments as delineated by the EC Act (2001).
Box: Role of the State Governments under the EC Act, 2001

 Coordinate, regulate, and enforce provisions of the EC Act, 2001, within the state.
 Regulate norms for process and energy consumption standards in any industry or building or
  building complex.
 Regulate energy consumption standards for equipment and appliances.
 Take all measures necessary to create awareness and disseminate information for efficient
  use of energy and its conservation.
 Arrange and organize training of personnel and specialists in the techniques for efficient use
  of energy and its conservation.
 Take steps to encourage preferential treatment for the use of energy efficient equipment or
  appliances.
 Constitute a fund to be called the State Energy Conservation Fund (SECF) to promote efficient
  use of energy and its conservation within the state.
 Enforcement of Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme compliance within the state.

9 Coal, oil, and other petroleum products, as well as gas and nuclear energy sources, are predominantly governed by national
agencies. Electricity and renewable energy sources of energy are governed by both central and state agencies, but with the
state playing a major role.

The Electricity Act, 2003
The Electricity Act (EA), 2003, was enacted to restructure and reform the ailing power sector. The EA has
created a consolidated governance framework for generation, transmission, distribution, trading, and
consumption of electricity adhering to market-based mechanisms. The EA aims to promote efficient and
environmentally benign policies across the value chain of electricity.
The EA has empowered the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs), under section 61 (c) and (e), to
regulate tariffs by considering the factors that will encourage competition, efficiency, economical use of
resources, good performance, optimal investments, and principles rewarding efficiency in performance. Section
42 (1) of the EA stipulates that developing and maintaining an efficient, coordinated, and economical
distribution system is one of the principal duties of the distribution licensees in the country. This signifies the
important role played by the states in advancing energy efficiency across the value chain of electricity in India.

National Action Plan on Climate Change
Recognizing the need to maintain a high economic growth rate for realizing developmental objectives while also
reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, the Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change
(PMCCC) initiated the National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008. The plan outlined eight national
missions running through 2017.

     National Solar Mission.
     National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE).
     National Mission on Sustainable Habitat.
     National Water Mission.
     National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem.
     National Mission for a Green India.
     National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA).
     National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC).

With the ultimate goal of advancing market-based approaches to unlock energy efficiency opportunities in
India, the NMEEE was administered under four major initiatives:
Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT): PAT is a market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness
of improvements in energy efficiency in large energy-intensive industries and facilities, through certification of
energy savings that can be traded. The EC Act (2001) provides the legal framework to establish and prescribe
energy consumption norms for any energy user notified as a DC. Under the PAT scheme, introduced in 2010,
the Government of India notified energy efficiency improvement targets in 2012 for 478 individual obligated
entities in eight energy-intensive sectors, namely, thermal power plants, aluminum, cement, chlor-alkali,
fertilizer, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and textiles. These sectors represent 65% of India’s total industrial
energy consumption. The targets were stipulated in the form of specific energy consumption (SEC)
improvement over a three-year cycle (2012–15).

To drive compliance under the PAT scheme, DCs achieving SEC levels that are lower than their targets can
receive energy savings certificates for their excess savings. These certificates can be traded on the power
exchanges and bought by other DCs, notified under the PAT scheme, to meet their compliance requirements.
DCs that are unable to meet the targets, either through their own actions or through purchase of certificates, are
liable for financial penalty under the EC Act.

The SDAs are entrusted with a crucial role of enforcement of compliance under the PAT scheme.
Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE): The objective of this initiative is to accelerate
the shift to energy-efficient appliances in designated sectors through innovative measures to make the products
more affordable. Under the MTEE, the BEE has launched the Super Efficient Equipment Program (SEEP). This
aims to enhance the penetration of the best available energy efficient technology in the market. SEEP is
structured to offer upstream incentives to the manufacturers that meet the technical specifications set out by

the BEE that are beyond the current product specifications prevalent in India. The BEE has also developed a
robust M&V framework involving quantity and quality checks of samples at the manufacturer and retailer
premises to verify compliance with technical standards, production, and sales data. A third-party measurement
and verification (M&V) agency will be appointed by the BEE for validation of sales and quality standards. In
times to come, the SDAs may play a crucial coordination role in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of
this scheme within the states.

Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP): This initiative aims to create mechanisms that will help
finance energy efficiency investments in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. Partial Risk Guarantee
Fund and Venture Capital Fund are conceptualized to be administered at the national level to support energy
efficiency investments. Another key objective of this platform is to stimulate financing from energy service
companies (ESCOs) by adopting energy performance contracting models. Some of the potential markets for
scaling up ESCO financing are municipal lighting, commercial buildings, industry (including micro, small, and
medium enterprises (MSMEs)), and utility demand-side management (DSM) (including residential appliances
and agriculture pumping). The states have a major role to play in demonstrating the benefits of
innovative financing mechanisms through pilot-scale energy efficiency projects and also
facilitating a conducive policy environment to replicate successful models.

Framework for Energy-Efficient Economic Development (FEEED): This component intends to
provide appropriate fiscal instruments that may supplement the efforts of the government for the creation of an
energy efficiency market. The central government (income tax department) has allowed accelerated
depreciation of 80%10 (percentage of written-down value) for 43 energy-saving devices. The Government of
India has exempted special additional duty (SAD) on all imported components for their use in the manufacture
of light-emitting diode (LED) drivers and metal-clad printed circuit board for LED lights and fixtures and LED
lamps. In addition, the basic customs duty is being exempted on lithium-ion automotive batteries for
manufacture of lithium ion battery packs for supply to the manufacturers of hybrid and electric vehicles. The
Government of India has also launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles
scheme, known as FAME India, offering demand incentives to buyers of hybrid and electric vehicles at the point
of purchase.

In times to come, the states will have a crucial role to further drive the uptake of energy-efficient technologies
and services through state-administered fiscal instruments.

Other National Energy Efficiency Programs
Apart from NMEEE initiatives, BEE has been administering several other programs, which include the
following:

Standards and Labeling (S&L): S&L is one of the flagship initiatives of BEE that aims to enable consumers
make informed decisions regarding the purchase of energy-consuming equipment or appliances based on the
latter’s energy consumption labels. The EC Act, 2001, has provided the necessary legal framework to specify
energy performance standards and direct display of labels for appliances and equipment consuming energy.
Currently, 14 categories of appliances and equipment have been covered under the program with four
categories (frost-free refrigerator, tubular fluorescent lamp, room AC, and distribution transformer) in the
mandatory comparative labeling regime and 10 others in the voluntary comparative labeling regime. During
2007–11, BEE’s S&L program delivered about 11.6 billion units of energy savings and 5 ,100 MW of avoided
generation capacity. Six more categories of appliances and equipment are expected to be covered in the near
future. As per the EC Act, SDAs have a crucial role in appointing inspecting officers for ensuring compliance of
S&L within the state.
Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC): The BEE developed and issued the ECBC in 2007, which
applies to commercial buildings with a connected load of 100 kW or 120 kVA. However, currently only seven
states have notified it. Another nine states have amended the ECBC to suit their local and regional climatic

condition. Another seven states are in the process of making such amendments.11 The National Building Code,
2005, formulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards, is the comprehensive building code providing guidelines
for regulating all types of building construction activities across the country. It serves as a model code for
adoption by all states and agencies in all jurisdictions. Apart from this, there are other systems, such as the
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment
(GRIHA) that consider environmental norms for rating of buildings and labeling them as green buildings.
The state governments have an important role to play by incorporating the ECBC into the building bylaws and
enforced by municipalities. The BEE has developed ECBC compliance check tools to build the capacity of local
municipalities for the enforcement of ECBC.
Capacity building of electricity distribution utilities: The BEE, in partnership with the Energy
Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), has recently initiated a nationwide capacity building program to
mainstream DSM into utility operations. As part of the capacity building initiatives, The EESL is currently
supporting 33 selected utilities across the country in doing the following:

          Conducting load research study to characterize end-use electricity consumption and identify strategic
           demand-side measures.
          Developing concrete action plans to formulate and design programmatic DSM interventions.
          Strengthening the capacity of DSM cells with technical and financial advisory support for DSM program
           implementation and coordination.
          The states have an important role to effectively coordinate with central agencies, plan, and realize
           demand-side resources in a cost-effective manner within the purview of relevant regulations.

3. Assessment: Objectives and
Methodology
Rationale
Given that the energy sector, specifically the power sector, is in the concurrent list of the Indian constitution
and that economic and industrial development is also a state subject, the promotion and implementation of
energy efficiency policies and programs are a shared responsibility of the center and states. It is, therefore,
important that national institutions like the BEE, responsible for the formulation of energy conservation
programs, engage with the states to pursue energy efficiency goals in the country. In other words, the
effectiveness of central policies towards a resource efficient economy lies in pursuing a state focused agenda.
On the other hand, the concerned state agencies must complement the central efforts, guided by the states’
priorities and local conditions, to facilitate market-driven approaches and create self-sustaining energy
efficiency markets.
With the energy efficiency agenda gaining traction and momentum in India, there is a need to continuously
evaluate the policies and programs at the state level. Comparative benchmarking is a proven methodology to
evaluate states on their policy and program efforts, identify best practices, and give recommendations for
improving their governance performance.

Objectives
One of the key objectives of this study is to develop a framework and methodology for the evaluation of a state’s
strategic energy efficiency policies, market maturity for its energy efficiency services, and institutional strength
to plan, implement, and deliver energy efficiency programs, projects, or activities. This report presents an
index-based evaluation of individual states to benchmark their readiness for energy efficiency implementation.
The benchmarking across the states will serve as a comparative reference point for the states to measure,
monitor, and evaluate the chosen indicators that best depict the energy efficiency implementation readiness.
This report is expected to raise the profile of energy efficiency in the state government’s decision-making
process, strengthen ongoing activities, and enable state-level institutions to perform and target better results.
Moreover, the indexing of the states will act as a benchmarking tool, which in turn will create a sense of
competitiveness, leading the states to push for more aggressive reforms and programs towards energy
efficiency. The report will also highlight unique and successful best practices adopted across the states, which
have the potential to be scaled up or replicated throughout the country.
To benchmark Indian states, this study has considered 28 states (excluding the newly formed state of
Telangana) and the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

Literature Review
The idea of comparative benchmarking of territorial energy efficiency performance has been in existence for
more than a decade now. Earlier research has scored and ranked states and countries in a particular region on a
number of energy efficiency policies. Recent efforts have considered a wider range of indicators going beyond
policies. Some of the world-recognized efforts in this regard are described below.

     The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) has published nine editions of the State
      Energy Efficiency Scorecard and two editions each of the city and international energy
      efficiency scorecards. These scorecards have measured the progress of policies and programs that save
      energy while also benefiting the environment and promoting economic growth. The state scorecard ranks
      U.S. states on six broad categories of indicators—utility programs, transportation, building energy codes,
      combined heat and power, state initiatives, and appliance standards. The city scorecard ranked 51 large
      U.S. cities for their energy efficiency efforts across five policy areas: local government operations,
      community-wide initiatives, buildings, energy and water utilities, and transportation. The international

      indicators to evaluate how efficiently these economies use energy.

     Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy (RISE) involves a suite of indicators that
      assesses the legal and regulatory environment for investment in sustainable energy. It establishes a
      framework for depicting the national enabling environment better to attract investments into three pillars
      of sustainable energy—energy access, RE, and energy efficiency. With more than 25 specially designed
      indicators and detailed country-specific data from across the globe, RISE intends to provide a global
      reference point that will support decision making for governments and inform country-level interventions
      under SE4ALL (Sustainable Energy for All). The data collected through RISE will help countries evaluate
      their enabling environment in each of the three SE4ALL pillars and identify policies and other instruments
      they may need to move towards their sustainable energy vision. RISE ultimately will help stimulate policy
      dialogue, identify priority areas for change, and point to good practices across nations that can foster an
      enabling environment for sustainable energy. The RISE pilot report covered 17 developed and developing
      countries and was launched in November 2014.

     The Arab Future Energy Index (AFEX) is the first native Arab index dedicated to monitoring and
      analyzing sustainable energy competitiveness in the Arab region. AFEX offers both quantitative and
      qualitative analysis for key RE and energy efficiency market dimensions. Countries are ranked under 30
      indicators that illustrate key energy market aspects, including policies, institutional and technical
      capacities, strategies, socioeconomic data, and investments. AFEX is published annually and consists of two
      components: AFEX RE and AFEX Energy Efficiency. The latest edition (2013) of AFEX Energy Efficiency
      index ranked 17 Arab nations and provided tailored recommendations for countries to help improve their
      transition towards sustainable energy pathways.
In India's context, a study carried out by Prayas Energy Group had performed assessment of state-level
initiatives on DSM front. The study reviewed utility-driven DSM activities, DSM regulations or directives by
state commissions, and DSM-related planning in eight States: Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana,
Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Haryana, and West Bengal.

Methodology
Aligning with the objective of the study, which is to evaluate state-level energy efficiency implementation
readiness under three broad areas or categories—(a) policies and incentives, (b) market maturity, and (c)
institutional strength—this study adopts a set of 11 readiness factors that are assessed by applying a suite of
evidence indicators that are both qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative evidence indicators capture
whether a specific policy, mandate, incentive, institution, financing mechanism, or other characteristic exists
under each of the readiness factors. The quantitative evidence indicators aim to assess the energy efficiency
potential already unlocked and also reflect the current progress towards implementing key energy efficiency
measures or programs recognizing that the states having prior implementation experience would be better
prepared to scale the intervention. Appendix A provides an overview of the selection approach for the different
evidence indicators.
These 11 factors and corresponding evidence indicators are chosen so that the assessment becomes
comprehensive yet simple and analytical, and that it appropriately reflects the states’ readiness performances in
the context of their role in the existing energy efficiency governance framework, growing market-based
opportunities, and overall national policy environment. This approach will allow meaningful comparative
analysis and benchmarking among the states. The 11 factors considered for the evaluation are presented in
Table 5. These are further broken down into 77 evidence indicators for appropriate depiction of energy
efficiency implementation readiness at the state level (refer to Table 6).

As discussed earlier, both qualitative and quantitative evidence indicators are adopted to capture and evaluate
the current status and progress of the readiness factors. All the evidence indicators considered under “Energy
efficiency potential and implementation experience” are quantitative. All other remaining evidence indicators
across the 10 different readiness factors are qualitative. For the sake of maintaining simplicity and objectivity in
the evaluation, most of the evidence indicators are structured as questions with simple “Yes/No” alternatives.
Index-based assessment against each evidence indicator is done on a scale of 0 to 1. A state is awarded a score
of 1 against an evidence indicator when a qualifying activity is recorded in the state on that front, or else it gets a
0. In some cases, for example, when an energy efficiency regulation, policy, or action plan is found to be in the
process of development, in the draft stage or yet to be notified, the state is awarded a score of 0.5.
Evidence indicators that represent quantitative performance (such as the extent of distribution of LED lamps
among households) are normalized to compare states on a level playing field irrespective of their size, and
scaled between 0 and 1. The distance to frontier approach is adopted, where the frontier represents the best
performance by any state observed against that evidence indicator.
All evidence indicators are scored between 0 and 1 and aggregated with equal weights. While each factor can
have a different number of evidence indicators, the latter holds equal weight and the indicators are aggregated
to form the factor score. One may construe that the number of evidence indicators in each of the readiness
factor becomes an inherent weight for that factor in estimating the overall index for the state. In this regard, the
states with higher index values are deemed to be able to fare better than other states.
In addition, this exercise expresses factor-wise or category-wise scores of individual states in percentages,
which will reflect the progress of the states in specific areas as well as overall.

As with any index-based benchmarking exercise, this evaluation also heavily depends on data or information.
Most of the information or data used for the assessment of states against evidence indicators has been sourced
from publicly available sources. None of the information collected or compiled for the purpose of this report is
vetted by state government officials. Information related to state legislation, policies, regulations, directives or
schemes and programs has been checked on the websites of competent authorities, which include state-
designated agencies (nodal agency for energy efficiency in a state) and state electricity regulatory commissions.
Relevant data related to given energy efficiency programs are collected from reliable databases in public
domain. Data on sector parameters are sourced from flagship reports or central information repositories of the
Government of India. All these sources are so chosen that the furnished information or data are authentic.
For maintaining consistency while assessing the states’ readiness, the exercise has considered states’ actions
recorded until December 2015 unless otherwise mentioned in the report.

Caveats
Domestically, this is a significant and first-of-its-kind effort that aims to benchmark the readiness of all the
Indian states for advancing energy efficiency implementation. With no precedence of such evaluation, the study
has its own share of challenges and imperfections.
The readiness factors and corresponding evidence indicators chosen for benchmarking under this study may
not be comprehensive in all aspects to reflect the readiness of states for advancing energy efficiency
implementation. Moreover, the current structure of readiness index builds on the hypothesis that it is
important to accelerate energy efficiency implementation by way of enforcing regulatory compliance, building
institutional capacity, creating self-sustaining policy driven markets and attracting investments. While this may
be true, there are several other factors that may drive the implementation of energy efficiency measures and
actions within states and therefore that may be relevant for consideration in building a more comprehensive
readiness index. It is envisaged that this benchmarking exercise will be updated at least once every two years to
sustain the objectives and outcomes. The future editions of this report can gradually build the readiness index
into a more comprehensive one, considering all facets of energy efficiency implementation drivers within the
control of states.
Some of the readiness factors and indicators that can be considered for future index building are listed below:
      1.   The political environment.
      2. Coordination and cooperation with national and federal policies and institutions.
      3. Access to energy efficient technologies.
      4. Energy efficiency services market.
      5.   Cross-cutting factors relevant for attracting energy efficiency investments (such as energy price or tariff
           and level of subsidies).
      6. The budget allocated for energy efficiency promotion (as % of total State budget).
      7.   The budget allocated for energy efficiency awareness and training programs (as a percentage of the
           total energy efficiency budget).
      8. The energy-saving potential unlocked through successful pilots by utilities and other state authorities
         (such as state road transport corporations and municipalities).
      9. The energy-saving potential unlocked from energy audits.
      10. The human resource capacity available with the state authorities for energy efficiency governance and
          implementation.
Furthermore, 90% of the readiness factors and the corresponding evidence indicators considered for
comparative benchmarking of states are qualitative in nature and reflect the current status of policy,
institutions, and market maturity. Only 10% of the readiness factors are quantitative in nature. They reflect the
potential for energy efficiency and also the performance towards implementation of energy efficiency actions in
the states. At this early and nascent stage of energy efficiency evolution among most of the Indian states, the
current mix of readiness, potential, and results-oriented indicators may be acceptable; this mix best reflects the

state’s energy efficiency readiness. However, as the scenario evolves, it is important that the future iterations of
this benchmarking exercise increases the share of performance-driven factors in order to reflect the readiness of
Indian states in the best way possible.
It is also important to note that the states with higher readiness index than others may not always achieve
greater progress towards implementation. This is simply because there are multiple factors that affect private
and public investment decisions, many of them outside the immediate control of authorities, private sector, and
other stakeholders.
Another key challenge is the availability of updated and latest information to periodically update the readiness
index and make it more comprehensive. Most of the information used for the assessment of evidence indicators
in this report has been sourced from publicly accessible sources, including laws, regulations, public documents,
and existing databases. None of the information collected and compiled for the purpose of this report has been
vetted by state government officials.

4. Readiness Assessment of States
This chapter examines the state-level energy efficiency readiness under 11 readiness factors with the help of
index-based evaluation framework. The index-based scores of the states against each evidence indicator and
their resulting factor scores are presented in Appendix B.

Sector-Specific Action                                    Plan   for     Scaling            Up      Energy
Efficiency Efforts
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Planning represents the visions of governments translated into time-bound targets, actions, and milestones.
Clearly articulated sector-specific actions and targets are important ingredients of an enabling ecosystem for
energy efficiency implementation. Planning helps in setting a direction for all stakeholders to align their
decision making. Action plans backed by legislation show the commitment of the government towards
achieving energy efficiency goals.
Targets help in motivating implementing agencies to be more proactive and to measure the progress of the
energy efficiency initiatives. Targets also provide a basis for long-term energy efficiency programs and provide
justification for obtaining funding. For targets to be useful in measuring progress, they should be supported by
a strong analytical base, high-quality data, and a transparent measurement procedure. Targets can be expressed
in different ways while keeping in mind the SMART principles: specific, measurable, ambitious, realistic, and
time-bound. Sector and subsector level targets are the most effective, since they are more focused. Targets must
be quantified, and they should reflect the intended change from the baseline situation. In this regard, a core
task of indicative target-setting for energy efficiency is a precise calculation of the baseline consumption.
Following are the key elements of a successful energy efficiency action plan :

     Baseline assessment: Energy consumption disaggregated among various economic sectors and energy
      sources and fuels.
     Assessment of energy efficiency and conservation potential: Disaggregated among sectors and energy
      sources and fuels.
     Assessment of short- and long-term targets, goals, and performance indicators: Disaggregated among
      sectors.
     Sector-specific action plan to achieve desired goals.
     Resource (human and financial) assessment to meet desired goals.
     Monitoring and evaluation framework.

Indian states pursuing energy efficiency on a mission mode are expected to progress faster and more effectively.
This is also advocated in the national legislative framework for energy efficiency (EC Act 2001).
A state that has formulated sector-specific policy or an action plan, along with quantified energy savings targets,
is expected to score full marks. States that have not taken any of the measures will obviously score nil.
Answers to the following questions yield the evidence indicators evaluated under this factor:

     Is there legislation, policy, or a sector-specific action plan that aims to improve
      energy efficiency?

     Is there a quantified energy efficiency goal or target (such as kWh/toe saving)?

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
About 14 states have officially adopted sector-specific energy efficiency action plans. Most of these states have
included the energy efficiency action plan as part of the State’s Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC).
Andhra Pradesh has developed an energy efficiency action plan as part of the Power for All program recently
launched by the Government of India. None of the states have enacted legislation backing the energy efficiency
action plan.
Karnataka and Kerala are the only states that have identified energy savings targets. However, these targets are
yet to be officially adopted. Some other states have mentioned energy-saving potential without setting any
target to achieve it.

Mandates for Utilities to Invest in Energy Efficiency
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Electricity utilities are at the center of energy efficiency delivery systems in India. The collective potential of
utilities to improve energy efficiency both at supply and demand sides is enormous. The quintessential
approach to capture this potential is by regulating the energy efficiency activities of utilities with clear and
unambiguous mandates.
Worldwide experience shows that several countries (for example, Australia: New South Wales; Canada:
Ontario; China; Italy; Poland; the United Kingdom; and the United States: California) have mandated some
form of quantified energy efficiency improvement targets for energy utilities, enforced by laws and regulations
with the threat of financial penalties. In the United States, compliance with such mandates is poised to be the
primary driver for the increase in utility spending for energy efficiency programs through 2025.12
Similarly for Indian states, utility mandates for energy efficiency will significantly enhance the readiness for
large-scale implementation.
Evidence indicators considered for evaluation of the readiness index in the above context are mentioned in
Table 7.

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
The findings of the assessment have been presented under each evidence indicator applied.

Stipulating State Utilities to Carry Out Energy Efficiency Activities in
Generation, T&D, or Demand Side
The EA, 2003, allows SERCs to bring necessary regulations in power generation, transmission, distribution,
and trading. The EA also empowers SERCs to advise the state governments on matters related to promotion of
efficiency in activities of the electricity industry . This index-based assessment intends to find out whether state
utilities are carrying out energy efficiency activities in their operations. As far as energy efficiency in power
generation is concerned, in few states, SERCs are found to direct thermal power generators to improve
efficiency in the form of reducing station heat rates (SHRs). The electricity regulatory commissions in Delhi,
Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are the notable ones that have set targets through generation
tariff orders to the state utilities to achieve certain SHRs.

Regarding energy efficiency intervention in power T&D, SERCs in all states have given targets or issued
directives to utilities to reduce T&D losses in power distribution. The regulators have also extended incentives
for utilities to achieve the targets. For example, Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has included
incentives in the form of additional return on investment (ROI) in the retail tariff orders if the distribution
companies (DISCOMs) surpass the T&D loss targets.

DSM, a promising frontier to improve energy efficiency in the power sector, has attracted certain initiatives at
the state level. As of April 2016, 19 states have notified DSM regulations, which establish a framework for
undertaking DSM measures. However, this does not necessarily imply that the DISCOMs in these states are
obligated to implement DSM measures. There should be directives from SERCs to the DISCOMs to implement
DSM measures. Alternatively, in the absence of a DSM regulation, SERCs can require a DISCOM to take
necessary action against the DSM, which may include ToD tariff as a demand-side response. Andhra Pradesh
deserves special mention in this regard. In spite of the absence of any notified DSM regulation, the state has
witnessed several utility-driven DSM measures, thanks to the initiatives taken by the state regulator and
DISCOMs. Up to now, none of the state DSM regulations specify any energy savings targets through utility-
driven DSMs or offer any incentive to DISCOMs to take DSM measures. The regulations only allow provisions
for DISCOMs to recover the DSM-related costs in their accounting by including them in the ARR estimates.

In this scoring exercise, states that have directives to implement DSM measures, including ToD, are considered
for scoring.

Awarding Penalties for Noncompliance with Energy Efficiency Requirements

It is found that in states where SERCs give energy efficiency targets to utilities with respect to power generation
and T&D, those targets are usually associated with some kind of penalty mechanism in the case of
noncompliance. For instance, SERC considers the target level of T&D loss in estimating the ARR for the
DISCOM, even though the latter could not achieve the target. This implies that a part of the power purchase
cost for the volume of electricity lost in T&D is not accounted for in the ARR, which is therefore a loss of
revenue to the DISCOM. A similar penalization mechanism is followed if the utility is given a target at the
generation side. However, such a penalty mechanism is not universally applicable across all states.

Alternatively, since DISCOMs do not have a DSM-based energy savings target, the question of penalty for
noncompliance does not arise.

Notification of DSM Regulations in States

DSM initiatives have gained traction in the states in recent years. As of April 2016, 19 states have announced
DSM regulations that establish a framework for undertaking DSM measures. Few other states have published
draft regulations. Figure 8 depicts the states where the DSM regulations have become effective.

Figure 8: Status of DSM Regulations in the States, as of April 2016
Guidelines on the Evaluation of Cost-Effectiveness and M&V of Utility-Driven DSM Measures

DSM is at a nascent stage of development in the country. Currently, Maharashtra and Punjab are the only states
in the country that have guidelines on the evaluation of cost-effectiveness or the M&V of DSM measures.
Maharashtra is the first state to so implement them.

Directive to Establish In-House DSM Cells

The Government of India launched a scheme for capacity building of distribution licensees in an effort to
mainstream DSM activities in their operation. In this regard, 30 DISCOMs across 21 states were selected under
this program. Under this program, the DISCOMs were required to establish in-house DSM cells. The current
assessment has awarded score against this evidence indicator to those states. Moreover, DSM regulations in
certain states have also stipulated that DISCOMs to set up DSM cells.

Providing Customer Incentives for Demand Responses

A review of the retail tariff orders indicates that in almost all states, the tariff structures include off-peak time
rebates or ToD tariffs as an instrument to reduce peak load. However, currently, such a tariff rebate is
applicable only for industrial consumers.

Some special-category states, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and
Sikkim, do not have such provisions in their retail tariffs.

Directive to Submit an IRP to the Regulators

IRP is a long-term utility plan for meeting forecast annual and peak energy demand, plus some established
reserve margin, through a combination of supply-side and demand-side resources over a specified future

period. International experience suggests that mandating utilities to adopt IRP is one of the important enabling
factors for driving utility-driven DSM programs in a country. IRP has been practiced in the United States for
more than 25 years through state legislation and regulatory oversight.

However, none of the existing national policies, acts, or regulations in India (read EC Act 2001; EA 2003; or
National Electricity Policy 2005) has given thrust on mandating utilities to adopt IRP in their investment plans.
Recently, the National Renewable Energy Act (2015), which is currently in draft form, has put emphasis on the
need to move towards IRP. It also provides the following definition for the same.

Section 3 of the draft RE Act—Definitions: IRP is a strategic plan for securing reliable and cost-effective
energy resources. The plan is an exhaustive, research-based examination of potential risks and opportunities in
procuring future energy supplies. Such a planning exercise does the following:

         Examines all available energy resource options, including supply-side, as well as demand-side, options.
         Makes a thorough, objective assessment of the benefits, co-benefits, direct and indirect costs, cost of
          externalities, and risks associated with each energy option.
         Evaluates all resources to maximize energy, as well as environmental and economic security.

Section 14 of the draft RE Act proposes the development of long-term vision for IRP as one of the functions of
the National Renewable Energy Advisory Group, proposed to be established to advise the central government
on the effective implementation of this act. However, there is no explicit consideration of demand-side
resources in the main body of the proposed act. In the absence of a policy, legislative or regulatory push, or
adoption of IRP by utilities in India is yet to be formalized. State-level initiatives in the form of directives to
utilities to submit IRP is not seen either.

Mandates for Public Institutions to Invest in Energy
Efficiency
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Adoption of new alternatives with high upfront costs by the public, although far better in performance, is a
challenge. However, when a government takes a stake in the use of these options, it often sends a positive signal
to the public for adopting them. In the case of promoting energy efficiency, the government at the center has
adopted a similar approach. To set a precedence, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, has issued a
notification directing all central government departments, ministries, and attached and subordinate offices to
ensure that all the procurement of the specified product categories (shown in Table 8) must carry the threshold
BEE star rating indicated against them, or higher.13 However, such mandates should not be limited to central
public institutions only. The state governments should follow suit by notifying the public institutions under
their jurisdiction to procure energy-efficient appliances or equipment for their use (such as efficient lights and
star-rated appliances).
Table 8: Specified Threshold Star Ratings for Select Appliances for Public Procurement

Appliance                                   Threshold star rating
                                            Five star (under normal conditions where annual usages are
                                            expected to be more than 1,000 hours)
Split ACs
                                            Three star (where the usage of air conditioning is limited, such as
                                            in conference rooms)
Frost-free refrigerators                    Four star
Ceiling fans                                Five star
Water heaters                               Five star


Apart from this, plenty of other opportunities exist for the state governments to promote energy efficiency, such
as advocating fuel economy in public vehicles and instituting energy conservation awards. This scorecard
matrix evaluates the states against these metrics as well. Table 9 highlights the evidence indicators employed
here.

in Energy Efficiency”
Are there binding obligations for procurement of energy efficiency applications for
the following?
-      Public buildings
-      Municipalities (includes water supply, waste water services, and streetlighting)
-      State road transport corporation
Is the Energy Conservation Award given at the state level?

Obligations for Procurement of Energy-Efficient Applications for Public Buildings and
Municipality and State Road Transport Corporation Services

The index-based evaluation finds that in 15 states, the governments have issued circulars regarding the
procurement of star-rated appliances—split ACs, frost-free refrigerators, ceiling fans, and water heaters—for
use in public buildings. States where such circulars have not been traced have failed to score under relevant
sub-indicator. Few states have made it mandatory for municipalities to take energy efficiency measures in their
services. For instance, the Government of Himachal Pradesh has directed all ULBs in the state to install energy-
efficient streetlighting. The study also found that none of the states have made it mandatory for state road
transport corporations to improve fuel economy in public vehicles.

Instituting the Energy Conservation Award

Instituting an award for energy conservation efforts is an effective way to promote energy efficiency. Although
the annual National Energy Conservation Awards instituted by the BEE have been presented since 1999, similar
initiatives are found only in eight states, which include Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala,
Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand. They have constituted the state energy conservation
awards.

Incentives for MSMEs to Invest in Energy Efficiency
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
MSMEs play a pivotal role in the economic and social development of the country, often acting as a nursery of
entrepreneurship. The MSME sector contributes significantly to the country’s manufacturing output,
employment, and exports. At present, MSMEs account for about 45% of India’s manufacturing output and 40%
of India’s total exports, and MSMEs have the highest employment growth rate. Despite this, MSMEs lack
modernization, which is reflected in the efficiency of energy use. Considering the potential of the sector, the
Government of India has set its focus on the upgrading technology in this sector. BEE has taken certain
initiatives in this regard, which include conducting situation analysis of 35 pre-selected MSME clusters, energy
audit, and technology gap assessment in 25 clusters, and preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) on
adoption of energy-efficient technologies.14 These apart, the Small Industries Development Bank of India
(SIDBI) has obtained a line of credit from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for financing
energy efficiency projects in MSMEs. The financial assistance is channelled through SIDBI, as well as through
refinance to banks or state finance corporations (SFCs) and nonbanking financial institutions. However, to
expand the reach of such initiatives, support at the state level is necessary.
Recognizing this fact, the evaluation framework employs the following evidence indicators to assess the states’
readiness for scaling up energy efficiency drives in the MSME sector:

      Are there energy efficiency incentives for MSMEs?

      Is there a program offering assistance to MSMEs to identify energy savings
       investment opportunities?

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
The assessment reveals that initiatives to encourage energy efficiency among MSMEs are very limited. These
initiatives may include giving fiscal incentives for investing in energy efficiency, recognizing selected MSMEs
for their energy-saving efforts, and offering assistance to identify energy efficiency opportunities. For instance,
Kerala has launched the Kerala State Energy Conservation Fund Credit Guarantee Scheme for energy efficiency
projects under which MSMEs can make use of collateral security-free loans for investing in energy efficiency.
However, it could not be ascertained whether the scheme is still in effect. Another key promotional initiative
taken by these states is to publicly recognize MSMEs for their energy savings through the state energy
conservation awards. They also publicize the energy savings realized by the awardees. However, this initiative

has not been considered in the scoring framework to avoid duplicity, since there is already an evidence
indicator to account the states’ action on energy conservation award.

Few states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu,
reportedly have energy efficiency investment promotion schemes for MSMEs. One of the initiatives is
conducting walkthrough energy audits and preparing feasibility studies for certain MSME clusters for
identifying energy efficiency opportunities. Few states also provide monetary assistance (subsidy for energy
audit) to MSMEs to undertake energy audit exercises and/or prepare DPRs.

Incentives for Large-Scale Users to Invest in Energy
Efficiency
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Industries represent about 38% of India’s final energy use ,15 and they consume around 45% of electricity
generated in the country. It is quite evident that this sector offers significant opportunity to reduce energy
consumption through energy efficiency interventions. Although the Government of India has introduced the
PAT mechanism where large industrial and commercial energy consumers (DCs) are given energy intensity
targets (toe/ton of production), quite a few industries or commercial entities are not included in the current
PAT scheme (only 478 DCs have been considered). Empowered by the EC Act (section 18), the states are free to
bring regulations on energy consumption standards in industries or the commercial sector. This can also act as
a precursor for any future mandatory targets to these consumers under a national scheme.
Taking due consideration of the states’ possible role to encourage energy conservation investments among large
energy consumers, this index-based framework applies certain evidence indicators for the assessment as
mentioned below.

         Are there energy efficiency incentives for large-scale energy consumers?

         Is there a program offering assistance to large-scale energy consumers to identify energy savings
          investment opportunities?

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
In India, one can see center-driven energy efficiency initiatives targeted at large-scale energy users, namely the
PAT scheme. However, although section 18 of the EC Act includes provisions allowing states to devise any
energy efficiency regulation for large-scale energy consumers, hardly any state governments have utilized them.
Only Kerala and Maharashtra have offered some kind of financial incentives to these consumers for taking up
energy efficiency activities. For instance, Kerala has launched an interest buy-down scheme for industrial and
commercial entities, wherein the latter can avail loans for investing in energy efficiency projects at lower than
standard commercial lending rates from financial institutions, with whom the state government has entered
into an agreement to implement this scheme. However, it could not be ascertained whether the scheme is still
being continued.

As far as recognizing energy conservation efforts of large energy consumers is concerned, the states that have
instituted the state energy conservation awards have used the platform to publicly recognize the energy-saving
efforts of these consumers. However, this initiative has not been considered in the scoring framework to avoid
duplicity, since there is already an evidence indicator to account for the states’ action on energy conservation
award.

Implementation of ECBCs
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Residential and commercial buildings sectors, which together contribute 29% of India’s total electricity
consumption,16 have witnessed a considerable rise in electricity consumption in recent years. The load from
these sectors is expected to increase further, considering the Government of India’s policy announcements, for
example, “Housing for All” by 2022. Recognizing the need to improve energy efficiency in the buildings sector,
following the provisions of the EC Act, the Government of India announced in 2007 the ECBCs for new
commercial buildings17 with a connected load of 100 kW or 120 kVA. However, this must be complemented by
the individual states through amendment and notification of ECBC at the state level to suit local or regional
conditions and needs.
Moreover, the state-notified ECBC should make it mandatory for the buildings to achieve a minimum energy
performance standard under a rating and labeling program, such as BEE star labeling. This apart, energy
efficiency certification systems, such as LEED and GRIHA, consider environmental norms, including energy
performance, for rating and labeling of buildings. Since these labeling programs are currently voluntary, the
states should incentivize builders to apply for energy labeling.
Considering the energy efficiency potential in the buildings sector, this index-based evaluation considers a set
of evidence indicators for assessing the states’ energy efficiency implementation readiness, as presented in
Table 10.
Table 10: Evidence Indicators for Assessing the Readiness Factor, “Implementation of ECBCs”
Status of adoption of ECBC
-     Notification issued
-     Amended
Are there energy efficiency codes for the following building types?
-     New residential buildings
-     New commercial buildings

Are building renovations required to meet a building energy efficiency code?
-     Residential
-     Commercial
Is there a standardized labeling scheme or rating system for qualifying the energy performance of
buildings (such as LEED/GRIHA/BEE star labeling)?
Are commercial and residential buildings required to disclose property energy usage at the point of sale
or when leased?
Are commercial and residential buildings required to disclose annual property energy usage?

Are there incentives for individual buildings to meet high-quality energy efficiency certifications?

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
The readiness index result gives a fair impression of state-wise status of energy conservation policy thrust in the
buildings sector. While the EC Act directs the states to amend the ECBCs and issue notification for
enforcement, only six states18—Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand—have
notified the ECBC, whereas 13 states have amended it, but are yet to announce it. In some cases, the ECBC
directives include disclosure of building energy usage annually. However, currently no ECBC compliant
building is reported in any of these states, and it is difficult to confirm the actual procedure followed to enforce
the building code.
Moreover, none of the states have made it mandatory to submit a disclosure of the property’s energy usage at
the time of sale or leasing of building.
Some states (such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Sikkim)19 have adopted an
energy labeling or rating system (GRIHA or BEE star labeling) for building certification. Some states reportedly
offer incentives in the form of tax concessions or additional free-of-cost floor area ratio (FAR) to GRIHA
compliant buildings.20 Few cities or ULBs (for example, Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh; Pune, Pimpri, and
Mumbai in Maharashtra; Jaipur in Rajasthan; Noida in Uttar Pradesh; and Kolkata in West Bengal) also give
incentives to GRIHA-compliant buildings.

Electricity Usage
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Insights into electricity usage go a long way in delivering end-use efficiency by way of operational and
behavioral changes of consumers. Information depicting how much, when, and at what cost energy is consumed
can help consumers make informed decisions to respond to price signals or other utility incentives, thereby
increasing the overall capacity for DSM. Information pertaining to past and peer usage enables utilities and
consumers to monitor, measure, and evaluate energy efficiency impacts in a transparent and reliable manner. It
is not just the knowledge of electricity usage; control is also an important function to leverage vital information
for acting timely upon demand-side measures.
This index-based evaluation exercise recognizes the usefulness of such practices and hence captures certain key
industry best practices that can strengthen the readiness of states for scaling up energy efficiency measures.
Table 11 presents the evidence indicators used in evaluating this readiness factor.

-     Ability to manage energy usage levels remotely (through apps or other
      technology mediums that can track real-time energy usage)



Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
After reviewing the supply codes of the respective SERCs, 21 states are currently found to furnish electricity
consumption details of previous months to the select consumer classes (domestic, commercial, and industrial).
Such information is typically provided in the electricity bills or, in some states, this facility is made available
online with restricted access to customers who can view past consumption in their accounts.

However, currently, none of the states inform the consumers about the electricity usage levels of peer groups or
make any such comparison to benchmark usage levels. Also, there is no regulation that stipulates that utilities
furnish such information by defining what constitutes peer groups and what indicators are to be adopted.

All the states are typically guided by the electricity supply codes that specify the standards and norms for
providing electricity usage information to consumers. Only in few states do utilities provide additional
information over what is stipulated in the supply codes to follow industry best practices and gain competitive
advantages. However, in a majority of cases, the largest utilities in individual states have been considered for
the assessment.

With regard to empowering consumers through smart features in power distribution, other than in Delhi,21 the
facility for real-time feedback to customers about their energy usage or managing consumption remotely is yet
to be implemented beyond pilot project scale in the country.22 Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. has
implemented automated demand response, which allows the DISCOM and the consumers to manage demand
or consumption based on real-time feedback.



Energy Efficiency Potential and Implementation
Experience
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
DSM is a promising frontier to improve energy efficiency in the power sector, especially in India’s current
scenario where imbalances in the power supply and demand have been a plaguing issue and traditionally been
dealt with ad hoc measures like involuntary load-shedding. The resulting depleted grid voltage or frequency
also puts at risk the stability of the grid system. This causes enormous problems and costs for both supply and
the demand-side players, while also creating social unrest. This state of play of the Indian power sector makes
the challenge of managing shortfalls in electricity supply indispensable for Indian utilities.
Demand-side measures effectively complement supply-side measures to mitigate such electricity crises by
focusing on measures that deliver end-use energy savings. International experience suggests that utility-driven

DSM can be delivered within short gestation periods unlike the conventional sources (coal, gas, and hydro-
based electricity generation systems). Also, the DISCOMs, serving end users, are uniquely positioned to deliver
demand-side measures by virtue of their relationship with the end consumers. Because of these advantages,
DISCOMs in India should adopt DSM measures to reduce load.
The current level of T&D loss (%), peak power deficit (%), and energy deficit (%) are the KPIs for tracking the
operational performance of DISCOMs in power supply and distribution. In India, since power is a concurrent
subject and most power DISCOMs are state-owned, the state governments play a major role in the decision-
making of these DISCOMs. Hence, the aforesaid KPIs can be effectively employed as evidence indicators to
evaluate the states on this front. While assessing the states, “distance to frontier” approach has been applied in
such a manner that the states having high T&D losses or power deficits will score less than the states who have
achieved lower losses or deficits.
One of the key institutions set up to tap the DSM potential across the country is EESL. Established in December
2009 under the aegis of the Ministry of Power, as a joint venture of four central public sector undertakings
(PSUs)—that is, the National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC), Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd
(PGCIL), Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC), and Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (RECL)—EESL aims
at unlocking energy efficiency and the DSM market, and implementing large-scale demand-side energy
efficiency projects, particularly in the public sphere, such as in municipalities, buildings, and agriculture. In
most cases, EESL has entered into agreements with state DISCOMs or municipalities to implement large-scale
DSM programs that include the Domestic Efficient Lighting Program (DELP)23, Energy-Efficient Street
Lighting Program, and Agricultural DSM Program (AgDSM). Recently, EESL launched the energy-efficient
domestic fan program wherein BEE 5 star–rated fans are provided to households to replace old inefficient fans.
Implementation of solar-powered irrigation pumps is one of the key thrust areas of the Government of India to
reduce agricultural load and improve network efficiency of DISCOMs. The Government of India has targeted
the installation of 1 million of solar pumps primarily for irrigation 24 through state nodal agencies and the
National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD). The central government provides a 30%
capital subsidy to farmers for the installation of solar pumps through state nodal agencies, and state
governments may also provide additional subsidy from their own funds.
Across all these initiatives, the active participation of the state governments is essential. Considering this fact,
the scorecard intends to capture the progress of the states by employing evidence indicators related to the
above-mentioned DSM programs. Table 12 showcases the evidence indicators applied in the present evaluation.

Distribution of LED Lamps among Households

The most significant achievement in scaling up demand-side energy efficiency through DSM is EESL’s DSM -
based DELP (UJALA Distribution scheme) that involves large-scale replacement of incandescent bulbs with
self-ballasted LED lamps in the residential sector. As of May 6, 2016, 16 states have undertaken the DELP with
varying degree of LED lamp penetration among consumers (refer to Figure 9). For instance, Andhra Pradesh
has recorded distribution of nearly 19 million LED lamps which, when normalized with the state’s population,
will have achieved a penetration level estimated to be 0.22 LEDs per person, whereas Himachal Pradesh has
witnessed distribution of about 6 million LEDs with a penetration extent of 0.87. All 16 of these states have
been evaluated based on the distribution of LED lamps until May 6, 2016. It is worthwhile to mention that some
states have carried out LED lamp distribution program with support from EESL under a separate scheme
known as Institutional Distribution scheme, whereby institution-run public spaces (such as railway stations and
colonies) have largely benefited. In this scorecard-based evaluation, these states have not been considered.

Replacement of Agricultural Pumpsets with BEE Star–Rated Pumps through Utility-Driven
DSM Programs

While performing the evaluation of the states against this evidence indicator, this study has taken into
consideration those initiatives that have been undertaken post 2010 through utility-driven DSM programs
whereby old inefficient agricultural pumpsets are replaced by BEE star-rated pumps. These states include
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Andhra Pradesh has recorded replacement of 2,496
pumps as compared to 1,927 pumps in Karnataka, 3,530 pumps in Maharashtra and 1,966 in Rajasthan (as of
February 2016). Gujarat has launched a subsidy scheme to encourage farmers to replace existing inefficient
pumpsets with BEE star labeled ones.

Adoption of LED Streetlighting

Installation of LED streetlights is one of the prominent DSM measures for reducing the load from
municipalities or public services. States that have undertaken this program include Andhra Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh.
Some of these projects are undertaken with assistance from EESL. Table 13 gives a snapshot of the projects
conceived under EESL’s Energy-Efficient Street Lighting Program.

Uttar Pradesh                                                    17290


Other than the EESL-driven program, some states have also taken their own initiatives, including Kerala,
Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, and Odisha. Apart from these, certain cities are at different stages of
implementing energy-efficient streetlighting programs, but are mostly limited to pilot scale, which are not
considered for scoring purpose. Few other states have also in principle given approval of such energy-efficient
streetlighting projects, such as in Karnataka.

Distribution of 5-Star–Rated Domestic Fans among Households

Recently EESL launched the energy-efficient domestic fan program, currently limited to two states: Andhra
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Until May 6, 2016, the program could realize distribution of more than 5,000 fans
(BEE 5 star–rated) in Andhra Pradesh and about 1,000 fans in Uttar Pradesh.
Implementation of Solar Irrigation Pump Program by the State Nodal Agency
The state nodal agencies in nine states, with support from the Government of India, have started implementing
the program. They are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. Rajasthan has installed the maximum number of solar pumps, to the tune of
3,400 until January 31, 2016, out of 9,902 pumps sanctioned.

Status of T&D Losses and Power Deficits
Demand-side measures are one of the effective ways to improve operational performance of DISCOMs in power
supply and distribution. T&D loss, peak deficit and energy deficit are the KPIs for tracking the performance.
India’s T&D loss is one of the highest in the world, estimated to be around 20%, with a wide variation between
the states. Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Nagaland, and Odisha reportedly have the highest T&D
losses, more than 30%. On the other hand, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have achieved significantly
low T&D losses.
Apart from T&D loss, peak power deficit and energy deficit are the two other major concerns in India’s power
distribution. Nation-wide average peak power deficit is to the tune of 3.2%. Only 10 states have recorded peak
power deficits of zero in the last financial year.
It is worthwhile to mention that the Government of India and state governments have made progress in
reducing the energy deficit, which is reportedly about 2.1% (in 2015-16). Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Punjab, and Sikkim have realized a zero energy deficit in the last financial year.
To revive the power DISCOMs and improve their operational efficiencies, the Government of India has
launched the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme. UDAY is expected to utilize the best principles
of cooperative and competitive federalism in achieving its goals. UDAY is operationalized through a tri-partite
agreement among the Ministry of Power, Government of India, State Government, and the DISCOM. Adopting
UDAY is optional for states. Table 14 highlights the key features of the UDAY scheme.

It is yet to be seen how the states have fared in reducing the distribution losses and peak and energy deficits.
Scoring against the applied evidence indicators, the progress in implementation of energy efficiency projects
has been evaluated based on normalization to compare the states on a level playing field irrespective of their
size, and scaled between 0 and 1. The “distance to frontier” approach is adopted, where the frontier represents
the best performance by any state observed against that indicator.

Financing Mechanisms Available for Energy Efficiency
Investments
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
Investment potential in India’s energy efficiency market is pegged at about 150,525 crore .2526 However, in
current scenario, the market is largely starving of sufficient investments. High upfront costs and not-so-
attractive financial returns (for example, longer pay-back periods) are considered to be the major barriers for
investing in energy efficiency projects. In view of this challenge, the EC Act directs the states to constitute a
fund for the purpose of promoting energy conservation in the states.
In recent times, several energy efficiency financing options or models are taking shape and have been tried
worldwide. These include energy service performance contracting, on-bill financing, and partial risk
guarantees. Recognizing the critical role of these evolving financing options for scaling up energy conservation
efforts, this index-based readiness assessment includes a suite of evidence indicators to examine existing
financial support frameworks for energy efficiency in the states (refer to Table 15).
Table 15: Evidence Indicators for Examining the Readiness Factor, “Financing Mechanisms Available for
Energy Efficiency Investments”
Are the following financial mechanisms available for energy efficiency activities?
State Energy Conservation Fund (SECF)
Capital subsidy for energy efficiency programs
On-bill financing or prepayment

Credit lines with banks for energy efficiency activities

Energy services agreements (pay-for-performance contracts)

Partial risk guarantees

Cost recovery through ARR or tariffs

DSM funds created by levy or cess or any notification in this regard

Others



Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
The evaluation outcome reflects that many states are yet to adequately consider energy efficiency in making
fiscal policies. One can see a limited number of financial instruments applied in implementing energy efficiency
measures. Financing energy efficiency measures through energy service contracts (ESCO model) is one of them,
which is getting traction in recent years. Cost recovery through tariffs of utilities is also one of the preferred
financing options. Here, expenditures incurred for adopting energy efficiency measures by the utilities are
accounted in latter’s ARR, as stated in their retail tariff orders.

According to the EC Act, 2001 the states are required to constitute the SECF for the purpose of overcoming the
major financial barriers in implementing energy efficiency projects in the states. The SECF of each state must
be formed from equal contributions of INR 4 crore from the state government and the BEE (with the exception
of the north-east states). Most states have developed this fund for financing energy efficiency activities.

26   A crore is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to 10 million.

Few states (for example, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Punjab) have capital
subsidy schemes for energy efficiency projects. On-bill financing, a new breed of financing model for energy
efficiency projects, has been tried in states like Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and
Punjab for funding DSM-based DELP among households. Here, the costs of the LED lamps distributed to
households are included in the monthly electricity bills of the consumers.

It is worthwhile to mention that Kerala reportedly launched an interest buy-down scheme and a credit
guarantee program for energy efficiency project financing. Under the interest buy-down scheme, commercial
entities interested to invest in energy efficiency can take advantage of credit at lower rates from selected banks.
The credit guarantee program allows MSMEs to put to use collateral security free loans for investing in
improving energy efficiency. However, it could not be ascertained whether these schemes are being continued.



Institutional Framework and Capacity
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
This study identifies five primary functional areas where institutional support is required at the state level for
enhancing energy efficiency implementation readiness, in line with the provisions of EC Act, 2001. They include
setting energy efficiency strategy and policy, regulating energy efficiency at the supply side (including
distribution), as well as demand sides, setting equipment energy efficiency standards, and enforcing or
certifying compliance with building energy codes.
The SDA constitutes the heart of energy efficiency governance system within a state in India. The structure and
design of such an institution must be carefully considered and adapted to fit local needs. The choice of the SDA
should reflect a state’s priorities, and should align with energy efficiency objectives, policy implementation
requirements, and many other factors. Strong leadership, dedicated and sufficient resources, financial
independence, good external cooperation, and private sector involvement are the critical factors and core
competences that contribute to successful functioning of an energy efficiency nodal agency.
Based on this understanding of required institutional framework in the Indian states, the following evidence
indicators have been considered for evaluation under this factor (refer to Table 16).
Table 16: Evidence Indicators for Evaluating the Readiness Factor, “Institutional Framework and Capacity”
Are there entities for the following:

Setting up a state energy efficiency strategy or policy. Do they have the sole mandate of promoting
energy efficiency?
Regulating energy efficiency activities of energy suppliers
Regulating energy efficiency activities of energy consumers
Regulating equipment energy efficiency standards

Enforcing or certifying compliances with building energy efficiency standards


States that have dedicated institutions for energy efficiency policy formulation and regulation can be regarded
as frontrunners under this readiness factor.

Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
The findings of the assessment have been presented under each evidence indicator applied.

This evidence indicator captures whether the states have assigned entities for setting their strategies or policies
on energy efficiency and, if at all, whether they have the sole mandate of promoting energy efficiency. In the
current framework of energy efficiency governance, SDAs have been vested with the responsibility of
formulating energy efficiency strategies or policies at the state level, as per the provisions of EC Act, 2001. It is
interesting to note that the profiles of the SDAs vary greatly among the states. Out of the 34 SDAs, 14 are
renewable energy development agencies, 9 are power departments of state governments, 6 are electrical
inspectorate offices, 3 are electricity DISCOMs, and 2 are societies registered under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860. Clearly, most SDAs have been given the mandate of energy efficiency governance as an additional
mission/portfolio. This creates a sense of competition between the energy efficiency and other mainstream
functions of the SDAs for internal resources.

Only the SDA of Andhra Pradesh’s (State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM)) has been constituted27 with the
sole mandate of promoting energy efficiency in the state. The Energy Management Centre, Kerala’s SDA, is also
unique in this regard. Constituted28 in 1996 as an autonomous body under the department of Power,
Government of Kerala, its primary mandate includes promotion of energy conservation in the state.
Nevertheless, the Kerala SDA does not qualify as an SDA with the sole mandate of promoting energy efficiency,
considering its other activities like developing small hydropower. The sole mandate with the Andhra Pradesh
SDA is expected to garner adequate resources without any competition for internal funds for advancing energy
efficiency implementation in times to come.

Dedicated Entities for Regulating Energy Efficiency Activities of Power Suppliers

In the current framework of electricity governance (EA 2003), SERCs are vested with the authority to regulate
power suppliers in the states. SERCs usually promote energy efficiency activities of DISCOMs through setting
T&D loss reduction targets to or bringing DSM regulations for the DISCOMs.

Dedicated Entities for Regulating Energy Efficiency Activities of Energy Consumers

Having a broad mandate of promoting energy conservation in the states, SDAs are responsible for regulating
energy consumption in the states. Apart from SDAs, SERCs serve a major role to regulate energy consumption
by introducing DSM regulations or tariff-based incentives (ToD tariffs).

Dedicated Entities for Regulating Equipment Energy Efficiency Standards

As per section 18 of the EC Act, a state can exercise its power to direct the regulation of the energy
consumption standards for equipment and appliances . However, Kerala is the only state that has exercised this
power. It has issued the Energy Conservation (Energy Consumption Standards for Equipment and
Appliances) Directions, 2015. Otherwise, this function is currently carried out by the BEE at the central level.
For necessary country-wide regulation of the equipment energy efficiency standards, the active involvement of
the states in this regard is vital.

Dedicated Entities for Enforcing and Certifying Compliance with Building Energy Efficiency
Standards

While the EC Act, 2001, directs the states to amend the ECBC and issue notification for enforcement, only six
states (Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand) have notified the ECBC. Although a
system for enforcement should be an integral part of the notified ECBC, ECBC notification in Karnataka does
not clearly designate any specific party for enforcement of the building energy codes. On the other hand, owing
to unavailability of a gazette copy of the ECBC notification of Uttarakhand, it would not be possible to give them
a score against this metric. In other states, in the absence of an ECBC notification, enforcing building energy
efficiency standards does not arise. However, Kerala is the only state that has introduced energy efficiency
standards for buildings (residential, commercial, and public) in spite of a pending ECBC notification. The
announced Energy Conservation (Energy Consumption Standards for Equipment and Appliances) Directions,
2015, also spells out the compliance framework, including directing DISCOMs to act in the case of
noncompliance.

India’s State-Level Energy Efficiency Implementation Readiness                                              May 2016
PwC                                                                                                               53
Monitoring and Evaluation Systems
The following subsections provide details of the assessment and its outcome under this readiness factor.

Significance of the Readiness Factor
For successful enforcement of regulations, institutional framework alone may not be enough for ensuring
compliance. It should be backed by appropriate compliance or enforcement mechanisms. Loopholes in the
mechanisms often defeat the very objective of such regulations. For example, in spite of the stipulating energy
efficiency targets to utilities in their generation, T&D or other business activities, real energy savings may not be
achieved until and unless relevant indicators are measured and tracked. Similarly, enforcement of ECBCs
warrants instituting an unambiguous and robust system for compliance. In both the aforesaid cases, lack of
propriety and transparency in the functioning of the enforcing agencies can be damaging and can lead to
mistrust among the stakeholders. This calls for engaging independent third parties for ensuring compliance.

Similar to enforcement, realizing the full energy-saving potential from energy efficiency solutions and programs
warrants a holistic approach. The latter may entail a range of steps, from undertaking comprehensive studies to
creating a self-sustaining system for stimulating energy efficiency efforts.

Taking into account the importance of readiness for enforcement or implementation of energy efficiency efforts,
this evaluation study examines the states based on the following set of evidence indicators (refer to Table 17),
which are chosen maintaining relevance with preceding factors.

Table 17: Evidence Indicators for Assessing the Readiness Factor, “Monitoring and Evaluation Systems”
Are energy savings or other target indicators measured to track performance in
meeting energy efficiency requirements?
- Generation
- T&D
- Demand side
Are the requirements measured or validated by independent third parties?
- Generation
- T&D
- Demand side
Does the regulator track utilities’ compliance with directives for providing energy
usage information to customers?
Are load research studies conducted by the utilities to plan DSM programs?

Has the SDA developed an empanelment mechanism for energy consultants and
auditors?

Does the notified ECBC directive specify a system for compliance with the building
energy efficiency codes?
Is the ECBC compliance verified by independent third parties?



Outcome of the Index-Based Evaluation
The findings of the assessment have been presented under each evidence indicator applied.

Measuring Energy Savings or Related Indicators to Track Energy Efficiency Compliance of
Utilities




India’s State-Level Energy Efficiency Implementation Readiness                                              May 2016
PwC                                                                                                               54
In case SERC sets energy efficiency targets to utilities in power generation and T&D, the energy savings or
related indicators, such as SHR and T&D losses, are measured and reported to SERC at the time of annual
performance reviews.

With regard to energy savings from utility-driven DSM measures, the DISCOMs usually report deemed or
expected energy savings from the implemented DSM measures based on certain M&V protocol. This study
considers such reporting as evidence of energy savings measurement to track the usefulness of DSM measures.
States that have implemented DSM-based DELP, LED streetlighting projects, or agriculture-DSM are
considered for scoring against this metric.

Validation of Energy Efficiency Measurement by an Independent Third Party

Upon examining the tariff orders, it is found that an independent third party is not involved in validation of the
energy efficiency measurement in any of the states. Regarding energy efficiency in power generation and supply
by improving station heat rate and through the reduction of T&D losses respectively, DISCOMs are required to
report necessary audited data to the SERCs for computing the losses. In case of energy savings through DSM,
DISCOMs only inform the SERCs about the expected energy savings from implementation of a DSM measure.
However, in some cases, validation of energy savings through DSM is conducted through surveys without any
direct monitoring using energy meters.

Regulator Tracking Utility’s Compliance with Directives for Providing Energy Usage
Information to Customers

All the state utilities are typically guided by the electricity supply codes that specify the standards and norms for
providing electricity usage information to consumers. Regulators track utilities’ compliance according to the
supply codes.

Load Research Studies by Utilities to Plan DSM Programs

Load research studies holds strategic importance as they help characterize the end-use electricity consumption,
identify strategic demand side measures, and develop action plans to formulate and design possible DSM
interventions. Load research studies are reportedly being carried out by one or more utilities in 23 states as of
April 2016 (see Figure 10).

Empanelment of Energy Consultants or Auditors

Empanelling energy consultants or auditors is one of the important steps SDAs should take to create an
ecosystem for scaling up energy conservation efforts in a state. This state-level assessment on energy efficiency
implementation readiness has identified 12 states (Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) that have
adopted mechanisms for the empanelment of energy auditors. Other states do not have a publicized system for
empanelling these players.

ECBC Directive Specifying a System for Compliance with Building Energy Efficiency Codes

The ECBCs notified by the states should clearly state the compliance or M&V protocol for proper enforcement.
However, there are cases where ECBC directives lack clear-cut guidelines on compliance—the roles and
responsibilities of the authorities involved are not clearly mentioned, which leaves plenty of ambiguity.
Moreover, the compliance requirement that involves verification by independent third parties is not included in
the ECBC directives in all the six states where ECBC has been notified.

Overall Outcome of Index-Based Evaluation
This evaluation study examines the energy efficiency implementation readiness of 28 states and the National
Capital Territory of Delhi against a suite of evidence indicators under 11 different energy efficiency readiness
factors. The latter is grouped under three broad categories: (a) policy and incentives (bi) market maturity, and
(c) institutional capacity. This stratified approach leads to index-based scoring of individual states under 11
factors (taking into consideration how they fare against the evidence indicators), based on which the states are
assessed under the three broad categories.
Tables 18–20 present the factor-wise index-based scores of the states, followed by their status in each of the
three readiness categories.

The outcome of the index-based evaluation reflects the significant gap between the states’ current level of
readiness in energy efficiency implementation and best practices for the sector, thus pointing out that most
states in India have a lot to act on to improve their capacity to pursue energy efficiency objectives. It is
paramount that state actors seriously consider the agenda of energy conservation an essential part of delivering
governance. Moreover, the concerned authorities, both at central and state levels, should recognize the
significance of creating a self-sustaining ecosystem at regional or local levels for driving energy efficiency
initiatives across the country.

5. Snapshot and Insights
The following sections give a snapshot of the current status of energy efficiency implementation readiness of 28
states and the National Capital Territory of Delhi under 11 readiness factors based on the index-based
evaluation detailed above. Here, the readiness of the states under each factor has been expressed in a
percentage of their index-based scores, and is presented in pie charts (refer to Figures 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23,
25, 27, 29, and 31). A similar approach is followed to present the outcome of the evaluation for each readiness
category (see Figures 33–35) and the overall energy efficiency implementation readiness (refer to Figure 36).
This helps draw a quick comparative assessment of progress among the states at factor and category levels. The
assessment is also reflected with the pan India average score to give a sense of where individual states stand
with respect to the countrywide level.
In addition, progress against major energy efficiency readiness indicators (represented in this study as evidence
indicators) has been tracked by accounting the number of states registering qualifying action against each
indicator. This is presented in the ensuing bar diagrams (refer to Figures 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30,
and 32), which suitably highlight specific areas where most states are lagging, and therefore warrant further
action.
The causal impact of existing state policies, regulations or institutional capacity on current scale of project
implementation is considered to be an interesting piece of information. This study, therefore, endeavors to
examine possible correlation between states’ performance in implementing energy efficiency projects (as
captured under the implementation experience readiness factor) and their preparedness for pursuing energy
efficiency. To this end, regression analyses have been carried out where implementation activities (accounted by
quantitative evidence indicators) are considered dependent variables, and qualitative readiness evidence
indicators relevant to those implementation activities are treated as independent variables. The causal effect of
individual energy efficiency readiness evidence indicators on project implementation can be evaluated from the
regression analysis-derived coefficient values. Whether the dependent variables (endogenous) are sensitive to
the independent variables (exogenous) can be determined from the statistically derived R-square value. Closer
the value to 1, more sensitive the endogenous variables are on the independent variables. It is also to be seen
whether the result is statistically significant as reflected from the F-value.
While the pace of energy efficiency project implementation activities in the states is gradually picking up, the
full impact of the state policies, regulations, or institutional capacity could not be ascertained assertively from
the regression analysis. There could be several reasons. The outcome of this analysis indicates that apart from
the defined exogenous factors—that is, states’ policies, regulations, or institutional strength—there can be other
ingredients to this energy efficiency ecosystem, such as political environment, coordination, and cooperation
with national and federal policies and institutions, access to energy-efficient technologies, and cross-cutting
issues like energy price and tariff, and level of subsidies. These factors might mask the effect of the states’
initiatives. There is scope to improve this regression analysis once sufficient time-series data are available.

Clearly articulated sector-specific actions and targets are key ingredients of an enabling ecosystem for energy
efficiency implementation. Hence, to start with the states should ascertain the energy efficiency potential across
different sectors in the state, formulate their own energy efficiency action plans and adopt sector-wise and time-
bound targets to achieve. However, only 14 states have developed action plans or policies towards energy
efficiency, and only two states have identified energy savings targets, but are yet to be formally adopted (refer to
Figure 12).
None of the states have enacted legislation backing the energy efficiency action plan (refer to Figure 12).

Power utilities are the most critical agents for achieving energy efficiency in a country. The collective potential
of utilities to improve energy efficiency both at supply and demand sides is enormous. The quintessential
approach to capture this potential is by regulating the energy efficiency activities of utilities with clear and
unambiguous mandates.
The assessment shows that state electricity regulatory commissions across all 28 states and the National Capital
Territory of Delhi have issued some kind of directives to the DISCOMs to reduce T&D losses in their networks
(refer to Figure 14). Another intervention area that has gained traction is DSM. Nineteen states up to now have
notified DSM regulations. However, up to now, none of the state DSM regulations specify any energy savings
targets to the utilities. Moreover, detailed guidelines on cost-effectiveness and M&V of DSM measures, a key
component to scale up a DSM initiative, are missing in most states. With regard to demand response, most of
the state regulatory commissions have approved a ToD-based tariff; however, it is limited to industrial
consumers. It is worthwhile to mention that integrated resource planning (IRP), considered one of the key
factors for sustaining utility-driven DSM initiatives, is yet to be part of India’s energy efficiency ecosystem.

ensure that the procurement of the specified product categories —that is, split ACs, frost-free refrigerators,
ceiling fans, and water heaters—must carry the threshold BEE star rating indicated against them, or higher. The
state governments should follow suit by notifying the public institutions under their jurisdiction to procure
energy-efficient appliances and equipment for their uses (such as efficient lights and star-rated appliances).
However, only 15 states are found to act on this (refer to Figure 16). Alternatively, there is hardly any directive
to municipalities or state road transport corporations to undertake necessary measures to improve energy
efficiency. To promote energy efficiency, some states have instituted the State Energy Conservation Award.

Despite MSMEs accounting for about 45% of India’s manufacturing output and 40% of India’s total exports,
they lack modernization, which is reflected in the efficiency of energy use. Considering the potential of the
sector, the Government of India has emphasized upgrading technology in this sector and launched several
schemes. However, to expand the reach of such initiatives, support at the state level is necessary, which is found
to be lacking. Only six states have given some kind of financial incentives to MSMEs for adopting energy
efficiency measures (refer to Figure 18). Fewer states have provided them assistance to explore energy efficiency
opportunities.

The EC Act 2001 allows the states to amend the ECBCs to suit the regional and local climatic conditions and
subsequently notify the codes. However, only six states have issued notification of ECBC, and 13 more states
have amended ECBC, but have yet to notify (refer to Figure 22). With respect to building energy labeling or
rating, municipalities or ULBs in only nine states have adopted GRIHA or BEE star labeling, whereas seven of
these states have offered incentives to builders in the form of tax concessions or additional free-of-cost FAR for
obtaining the labeling or rating certification. Interestingly, some of these states have yet to notify ECBC.

Information pertaining to past and peer usage enables utilities and consumers to monitor, measure, and
evaluate energy efficiency impacts in a transparent and reliable manner. It is not just the knowledge of
electricity usage; control is also an important function to leverage vital information for acting in a timely
manner on demand-side measures. Although providing past electricity usage data through customers’
electricity bills is a common practice in most parts of the country, currently utilities in none of the states inform
the consumers about the electricity usage levels of peer groups or make any such comparison to benchmark
usage levels (refer to Figure 24). Introduction of smart features is also at its infancy.

The most significant progress in energy efficiency project implementation in the country came on the heels of
establishment of “Energy Efficiency Services Limited” (EESL), a public sector ESCO to lead the investment
related actions and create self-sustaining energy efficiency and DSM markets in the country. In most cases,
EESL has entered into agreements with state DISCOMs or municipalities to implement large-scale DSM
programs that include the DELP29, Energy-Efficient Street Lighting Program, and AgDSM. Fifteen states have
taken part in household LED program, whereas LED streetlighting initiatives are running in 11 states (refer to
Figure 26). AgDSM, however, has immense potential, but could make less progress. Recently, EESL has
launched the energy-efficient domestic fan program wherein BEE 5 star–rated fans are provided to households
to replace old inefficient fans.
With regard to the Government of India’s program targeting the installation of 1 million solar pumps primarily
for irrigation through state nodal agencies and NABARD, nine states have been found to make progress.

The index-based energy efficiency readiness evaluation outcome reflects that many states are yet to adequately
consider energy efficiency in making fiscal policies. Three classical financial mechanisms are found to be the
mainstay to fund energy efficiency projects in the states: the state energy conservation fund, energy service
agreements, and cost recovery through electricity tariffs. Other more intricate mechanisms have hardly at all
been tried (refer to Figure 28).

There are five primary functional areas where institutional support is required at the state-level for enhancing
energy efficiency implementation readiness, in line with the provisions of the EC Act, 2001: setting energy
efficiency strategy and policy, regulating energy efficiency at the supply (including distribution) and demand
sides, setting equipment energy efficiency standards, and enforcing or certifying compliance with building
energy codes. Although all 28 states and the National Capital Territory of Delhi have state-designated agencies
(SDAs) that are vested with the responsibility of formulating states’ energy efficiency strategies or policies (refer
to Figure 30), their profiles are varied. Out of the 29 SDAs, the State Energy Conservation Mission (SECM), the
SDA of Andhra Pradesh has the sole mandate for promoting energy efficiency. All other SDAs have been given
the mandate of energy efficiency governance as an additional mission or portfolio. This creates a sense of
competition between the energy efficiency and other mainstream functions of the SDAs for internal resources.
In comparison to other states, Andhra Pradesh’s success in driving the energy efficiency effort may be
attributed to this particular institutional difference.

With regard to developing monitoring and evaluation systems, the states have fared well where they already
have existing mechanisms to do so. For example, every state has state electricity regulatory commissions to
monitor and evaluate performance of utilities. However, in new frontiers, such as building energy codes or
empanelment of energy auditors and consultants, few states are seen to have taken necessary steps (refer to
Figure 32).

6. Recommendations for States to
Scale Up Energy Efficiency from the
Current Scenario
The index-based evaluation is not only able to benchmark the readiness of Indian states for energy efficiency
implementation, but it also reveals critical deficits or barriers in this respect. From the outcome, the study could
derive crucial set of recommendations or action-points for the states to improve their readiness for scaling up
energy efficiency activities. Because of the varied energy efficiency scenarios among the 28 states and the
National Capital Territory of Delhi, proposing a separate set of recommendations for each state is beyond the
scope of this exercise. The following sections highlight the key recommendations under each of the 11 readiness
factors, which the states should take cognizance of.

Sector-Specific Action Plan for Scaling Up Energy
Efficiency Efforts
Formulating an effective and robust action plan paves the way for actual realization of the energy efficiency
potential in a state. Table 22 presents the key recommendations to frame necessary energy efficiency action
plans in the states.

Efficiency Action Plans
Although the states have developed                 Undertake a detailed study to identify plausible energy efficiency

                                                   energy efficiency interventions and set a time frame to pursue these
                                                   targets.

Mandates for Utilities to Invest in Energy Efficiency
Electricity utilities are at the center of energy efficiency delivery systems in India. The quintessential approach
to capturing this potential is by regulating the energy efficiency activities of utilities with clear mandates. Some
key “to do’s” with respect to mandating utilities are given in Table 23.

Energy Efficiency

effective mandates for them at the state level is necessary. Table 24 puts forward some key recommendations in
this regard.

Incentives for Large-Scale Users to Invest in Energy
Efficiency
The EC Act (section 18) enables the states to regulate energy consumption in industries or the commercial
sector. However, hardly any state government has taken an initiative on this front. Table 26 lists some key
recommendations on promotion of energy efficiency among large-scale energy users in the states.

Implementation of ECBCs
The study tracks that little progress has been made at state level towards implementation of ECBCs. Against
this backdrop, it recommends some key action points for the states that would enable effective rolling-out of
ECBCs across the states, as described in Table 27.

Financing Mechanisms Available for Energy Efficiency
Investments
One of the major barriers in driving energy conservation effort is the inadequacy of effective financing at the
state level. This study identifies some key areas that require urgent action by the states, as described in Table

Institutional Framework and Capacity
Most of the states are disadvantaged by poor institutional structure, along with lack of capacity to steer energy
efficiency initiatives. Considering the institutional shortcomings, the investigation puts forward a set of
recommendations for the states to consider (refer to Table 31).
Table 31: Key Recommendations for the States to Improve Their Institutional Effectiveness
Although states have designated agencies             It is necessary for each state to have a dedicated agency with

Monitoring and Evaluation Systems
Taking cognizance of the challenges faced in enforcing energy efficiency regulations in the states, Table 32
presents some key action points that can potentially plug in the loopholes in the enforcement mechanisms.

Note: Scoring against the applied evidence indicators, the progress in implementation of energy efficiency projects has been evaluated based on normalization to
compare the states on a level playing field irrespective of their size, and scaled between 0 and 1. The “distance to frontier” approach is adopted, where the frontier
represents the best performance by any state observed against that indicator.
