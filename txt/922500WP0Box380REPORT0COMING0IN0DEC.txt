Air right sale. One of the development-based LVC instruments. Govern-
ments sell development rights extended beyond the limits specified in land
use regulations (e.g., FAR) or created by regulatory changes to raise funds
to finance public infrastructure and services.

Bus rapid transit (BRT). High-quality bus-based services that mimic many
of the features of high-capacity metrorail systems but at a fraction of the
cost. Buses most closely resemble metrorail services when they operate on
specially designated lanes or have physically separated lanes for their exclu-
sive use. Grade separation of busways at critical intersections and junctures
also expedites flows. BRT systems often include bus stations instead of stops
to provide weather protection and allow passengers to pay before boarding.

Central business district (CBD). Areas where cities’ major businesses (finan-
cial institutions, stores, major convention and sport facilities, hotels, etc.)
are concentrated. CBDs produce agglomeration economies.

Eminent domain. Regulatory power granted to governments or public
agencies, which allows them to take private property for public projects or
interests, subject to appropriate compensation.

Floor area ratio (FAR). Ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of
the land on which it is built. The higher the FAR, the higher the density. Also
referred to as floor space ratio (FSR) or floor space index (FSI).

Greenfield development. New development that takes place on lands that
were not previously developed as urban land including agricultural, rural,
and unused land.

                 Land readjustment scheme. Landowners pool their land together for recon-
                 figuration and contribute a portion of their land for sale to raise funds to
                 partially defray public infrastructure development costs. This can be used
                 as a development-based LVC instrument to finance transit and TOD-related
                 investments.

                 Land value capture (LVC). LVC is defined as a public financing method
                 by which governments (a) trigger an increase in land values via regulatory
                 decisions (e.g., change in land use or FAR) and/or infrastructure investments
                 (e.g., transit); (b) institute a process to share this land value increment by
                 capturing part or all of the change; and (c) use LVC proceeds to finance
                 infrastructure investments (e.g., investments in transit and TOD), any other
                 improvements required to offset impacts related to the changes (e.g., densifi-
                 cation), and/or implement public policies to promote equity (e.g., provision
                 of affordable housing to alleviate shortages and offset potential gentrifica-
                 tion). There are two main categories of LVC: development-based LVC and
                 tax- or fee-based LVC. Development-based LVC can be facilitated through
                 direct transaction of properties whose values have been increased by public
                 regulatory decisions or infrastructure investment. Tax- or fee-based LVC is
                 facilitated through indirect methods, such as extracting surplus from prop-
                 erty owners, through various tax or fee instruments (e.g., property taxes,
                 betterment charges, special assessments, etc.).

                 Market freehold system. Land holding system under which landowners
                 have absolute ownership of land. Its conditions are full right of transfer,
                 right to bequeath, right to mortgage, full use rights (unless restricted by
                 law), and unlimited duration.

                 Mixed use. Pattern of development characterized by a mixture of diver-
                 sified land uses, typically including housing, retail activities, and private
                 businesses, either within the same building space (e.g., vertical mixing) or in
                 close proximity (e.g., horizontal mixing).

                 Nonmotorized transport (NMT). Any type of transport mode that is not
                 motorized, such as walking or bicycling. NMT has gained popularity as
                 not only a clean, carbon-free form of mobility with a very small footprint
                 but also as a means to improve public health through increased physical
                 activity.

                 Public-private partnership (PPP). Formal partnership between a public sec-
                 tor entity and a private corporation often used to construct and operate
                 infrastructure facilities or develop certain urban areas.

Redevelopment/regeneration. Type of development that seeks to reinvest in
already developed areas, typically targeting parcels that are underutilized
(e.g., vacant or abandoned properties); often considered part of an eco-
nomic development scheme.

Sprawl. Pattern of development characterized by uniform low density, lack
of a distinctive core, poor accessibility, dependence on automobiles, and
uncontrolled and noncontiguous land expansion.

State leasehold system. Land holding system under which lands are owned
by the States and the lands are leased by the States to individuals or firms
for a fixed duration, with lease fees and other conditions. The rights enjoyed
by lessees can vary with specific lease conditions, but terms frequently allow
for the right to assign the lease to another or allocate the residual value
of the lease. Development and use rights are likely to be restricted by the
States.

Transfer of development rights (TDR). Ability to effectively buy and sell “air
rights” (i.e., rights to fully develop the maximum allotted vertical envelope—
or “air space”—of properties) within the limit of their FAR allotment or the
unused development rights that remain when a particular building does not
use up its FAR allotment; typically applies only to certain parcels, and the
rights often can only be transferred to specific “receiving” parcels.

Transit-adjacent development (TAD). Development that is similar to TOD
in that it is located within the vicinity of a transit node but is not actually
connected with transit in the absence of pedestrian-friendly development
organized around a transit station.

Transit-oriented development (TOD). Compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-
friendly development organized around a transit station. TOD embraces the
idea that locating amenities, employment, retail shops, and housing around
transit hubs promotes transit usage and nonmotorized travel.

Urban redevelopment scheme. Development-based LVC instrument mainly
used in Japan. Landowners together with a developer establish one coop-
erative entity to consolidate piecemeal land parcels into a single site that
they then develop (e.g., high-rise building and/or mixed-use building) with
new access roads and public open spaces. The local government modifies
zoning codes and increases maximum FARs in the targeted redevelopment
district (typically around rail transit stations).
      Message to City Leaders




      Rapid growth has made your city heavily dependent on cars for
      transportation and is causing big headaches. Investors stay away as they
      lose time and money due to congestion. Parents complain that their
      children are developing respiratory diseases. And the poor must spend
      hours getting to work, to school, and to the hospital.

      Your fleet of buses is slow, aging, and overcrowded, stuck in ever-
      worsening gridlock. A new metro system has been proposed, but the
      price tag is more than US$1 billion. The economy has grown, and
      revenues have increased, but so have your expenditures on the
      construction of schools, public housing, and wastewater plants.
      Decentralization and fiscal autonomy have given you greater expenditure
      responsibilities but without corresponding fiscal devolution from the
      national government.

      When you attempt to raise the bus tariff, you face protests by people
      dissatisfied with poor bus service. And in reality, raising tariffs or taxes
      would be politically risky in light of next year’s election.




      T    his is a story typical of many rapidly growing cities, underscoring the
           enormous challenge of urban transit that city leaders must tackle. There
      is no panacea to fix these problems overnight—but there is a solution. A
      few cities in the world have successfully mobilized funds to develop their
      transit systems by capturing incremental land values attributed to transit
      investment. These land value capture schemes were used not only to raise
      the funds to construct transit but also to develop more sustainable urban
      spaces by exploring the synergy between land value capture and transit-
      oriented development.
         The underlying principle of land value capture is to jointly create value
      from transit-oriented development and to share this with all stakeholders.
      Adapting a land value capture scheme requires considerable effort from
      governments, transit agencies, investors, and communities, but it also



xvi
provides a great opportunity. With robust economic growth and increas-
ing populations, the conditions are favorable for undertaking land value
capture in many rapidly growing cities in developing countries, particularly
middle-income countries.
   This book aims to support these cities in adapting land value capture
schemes to construct and operate a transit system that promotes sustainable
spatial development. It presents the key conditions and enabling factors—
such as vision, strategy, policies, financing methods, and institutional and
legal framework—and specific land value capture techniques based on the
experiences of Tokyo; Hong Kong SAR, China; and other cities worldwide
that have benefited from incorporating these schemes into their develop-
ment plans.
   Should you let cars dominate your cities and towns, preventing citizens
from reaping the benefits of urbanization? Or should you take the initia-
tive to reclaim them by unlocking the value of land? The choice is clear. We
believe that unsustainable development trajectories caused by rapid motor-
ization can be reversed—and we are committed to supporting your efforts
to pursue inclusive and sustainable urban development through transit-
oriented development.

Overview




C     ities in developing countries are experiencing unprecedented growth.
      But this is often accompanied by the negative impacts of car-dependent
urbanization such as congestion, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions,
inefficient use of energy and time, and social inequality of accessibility.
The World Bank’s Transforming Cities with Transit: Transit and Land-
Use Integration for Sustainable Urban Development (Suzuki, Cervero, and
Iuchi 2013) concluded that compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly devel-
opment organized around a transit station is one of the most effective stra-
tegic initiatives to address the negative effects of motorization.
    Despite increasing recognition of transit-oriented development as an effec-
tive strategic approach for sustainable urban development, most cities, partic-
ularly those in developing countries, do not have the practical know-how and
expertise to make transit-oriented development happen. Because these cities
are almost always under a severe fiscal constraint, they face great challenges
in financing capital-intensive mass transit systems to reverse car-dependent
urbanization. Development-based land value capture (LVC) in Hong Kong
SAR, China; Tokyo; New York; Washington, DC; and London allows these
cities not only to generate funds for transit investment and operation and
maintenance but also to promote sustainable urban development. If adapted
well to local contexts, such schemes have great potential to become an effec-
tive finance and planning apparatus for cities in developing countries.
    Many rapidly growing cities in developing countries, particularly those
in emerging middle-income countries, are endowed with macro conditions
for development-based LVC schemes. Strong economic growth, rising real
incomes, increasing motorization, and congestion all cause land values to
appreciate near transit stations or corridors. And some forward-looking
cities in middle-income countries such as Nanchang, Delhi, and Hyder-
abad are adapting development-based LVC for their metro systems. But the
majority of cities in developing countries have not yet fully explored these
                                                                                  1

                      favorable conditions to adapt locally-specific development-based LVC
                      schemes. Why? Because they lack a consistent vision, strategy, and policy.
                      They also lack legal and institutional frameworks. And they lack technical
                      expertise, capacity, and experience. This book can help them fill these gaps
                      and adapt their own development-based LVC scheme as a strategic appara-
                      tus for urban finance and planning.


                      Car-Dependent Urban Development in
                      the Developing World
                      The 21st is the century of cities. More than half the world’s people, or 54
                      percent of the world’s population (UN Department of Economic and Social
                      Affairs 2014), reside in urban areas, and 7 of every 10 people will live in
                      cities by 2050, with about 90 percent of the growth in developing coun-
                      tries (UN-Habitat 2013). Cities globally generate about 75 percent of gross
                      domestic product. But urbanization also bears social, economic, and envi-
                      ronmental costs. Cities consume about 67 percent of energy and produce
                      about 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. And the problems of car-
                      dependent urban development—congestion, air pollution, greenhouse gas
                      emissions, lengthy commutes, and social inequality in accessibility—have
                      been increasing in rapidly growing cities in developing countries. Enrique
                      Peñalosa, former mayor of Bogotá, said (in 2005), “Transport differs from
                      other problems developing societies face, because it gets worse rather than
                      better with economic development.” As wealth increases, people shift from
                      walking to bicycling, and then from bicycling to riding motorbikes and to
                      driving cars. By 2050, China is projected to have 900 million cars, or more
                      than the number in the world today (Fulton and Cazzola 2008).
                          Recognizing the problems of car-dependent urbanization, many cit-
                      ies in developing countries have started to invest in metrorail, light rail,
                      bus rapid transit, and commuter and heavy rail transit. But these systems
                      are extremely intensive in capital. Beyond the upfront construction costs,
                      operation and maintenance also require substantial cross-subsidies from
                      other revenue sources because fare revenues in most cities are insufficient
                      (Murakami 2012). Such operational deficits are due in large part to the
                      weak integration of transit infrastructure with urban development. And
                      suitable development schemes are often unavailable for transit and plan-
                      ning agencies in developing countries (Suzuki, Cervero, and Iuchi 2013).
                          These constraints have stimulated interest in development-based LVC for
                      transit financing and sustainable urban development. Indeed, Hong Kong
                      SAR, China; Tokyo; Osaka; and Singapore have been using it to finance
                      transit costs and promote sustainable urban development.


                      Development-Based Land Value Capture as a Strategic
                      Apparatus for Transit Financing and Urban Planning
                      The notion of land value capture is to “mobilize for the benefit of the com-
                      munity at large some or all of the land value increments (unearned income)
                                                                                      Overview        3



generated by actions other than the landowner’s such as public investments
in infrastructure or administrative changes in land use norms and regula-
tions” (Smolka 2013) (figure O.1).
   Unlike taxes and fees, development-based instruments capture land value
increments by selling or leasing land, development rights, and air rights.
Under such schemes, governments, transit agencies, developers, and land-
owners jointly increase land values by exploring development opportunities
of transit station areas and sharing increments in land values.
   Development-based LVC has the following advantages over taxes and
fees in financing transit and transit-oriented development related invest-
ments (table O.1):

  • It has greater potential to finance capital-intensive transit and transit-
    oriented development related investments without significant fiscal
    distortion or public opposition to additional taxes or fees.
  • It can generate not only direct revenues from incremental land value
    increases attributed to transit investments but also more sustainable
    long-term revenues from higher transit ridership and retail shops, lei-
    sure facilities, parking, and residential buildings in the precinct of sta-
    tion areas.

    •	 By changing land use regulations, such as allocating higher floor area
       ratios (FARs) and converting land from single to mixed use, govern-
       ments can increase densities in station areas for diverse uses while
       increasing revenues.
    •	 By using proceeds for investments in station areas (such as parks,
       street lights, bike lanes, and pedestrian sidewalks), governments,
       transit agencies, developers, and communities can jointly develop
       efficient, attractive, and safe public places, further increasing prop-
       erty values.
    •	 By providing bonus FARs or other regulatory incentives, governments
       can require developers to include social facilities and affordable hous-
       ing in exchange for the additional rights.
   This is not to deny the usefulness of tax- or fee-based schemes, which
have their own advantages. For instance, the revenues from property
taxes can be sustainable because their collection does not deplete finite
land resources. Nor does adopting one category of LVC preclude adopt-
ing another. Taking into account the different objectives, the regulatory
and administrative feasibility, and the political acceptability of public infra-
structure finance, these different instruments can be applied separately or
jointly in ways that suit the conditions of countries and cities.


Global Good Practices for Development-Based LVC
Two global cities in Asia—Hong Kong SAR, China, and Tokyo—pro-
vide cases of successful large-scale development-based LVC as a strategic
apparatus for sustainable urban finance and development. They have been
applying development-based LVC not only to recoup the costs of mass
transit construction, operation, and maintenance but also to support tran-
sit-oriented development for sustainable urban development.

Hong Kong SAR, China’s, R+P Program
Hong Kong SAR, China, is one of few global cities whose rail transit sus-
tains the world’s densest urban form productively. The 218-kilometer mass
transit railway (MTR) network consists of 10 railway lines with 84 stations
serving Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories, with more
than 4 million passenger trips a day. Due to the high ridership, MTR gener-
ated a net operating profit of HK$6.694 billion (US$869 million) from its
transit operation and achieved farebox recovery of 185.5 percent for 2012.
This financial success is thanks to the Rail Plus Property (R+P) program
implemented by the MTR Corporation (map O.1).
   Under the R+P program, the Hong Kong SAR, China, government gives
exclusive property development rights of government-owned land at a
“before-rail” market price. MTR then captures the land value increment
created by R+P, such as accessibility and agglomeration benefits thanks to
transit and transit-oriented development related investments, by partnering
with private developers in developing the land and selling the completed

                      development at an “after-rail” market price. It recoups the capital, oper-
                      ating, and maintenance costs of railway projects through sharing profits
                      (figure O.2). R+P also allows MTR to integrate different phases of rail and
                      property development projects, ensuring smooth project implementation
                      and reducing transaction costs.
                          From 2000 to 2012, property development produced 38 percent of
                      MTR’s corporate income, related businesses (such as commercial and prop-
                      erty lease and management business) 28  percent, and transit operations
                      34 percent. From 1980 to 2005, the government received US$18 billion
                      equivalent in net financial returns, with earned income from land premiums,
                      market capitalization, shareholder cash dividends, and initial public offer
                      proceeds of US$22.2 billion equivalent, minus the equity capital injected of
                      US$4.2 billion equivalent. Although MTR is entitled to capture land value
                      increments, its financial benefits are distributed to the government through
                      dividends and appreciation of the value of its shareholding. MTR also con-
                      tributes to sustainable urban development and economic development by
                      providing efficient transit services and high quality property development.

The following key principles ensure the program’s effectiveness:

• Master plans and policy documents consistently state the importance
  of an MTR network as a “backbone” of urban and regional develop-
  ment, particularly during a rapid growth period.
• A public leasehold system controls urban land supply, attracts private
  resources, and ensures public interests around new railway corridors.
• The Comprehensive Development Area zoning sets special FARs around
  key stations to attract private investment to strategic locations, while
  providing flexibility for private developers to negotiate and design.
• Property development rights are exclusively granted at a pre-rail mar-
  ket price for a business-oriented rail corporation to cover the capital
  and running costs of a rail project and to master multiple functions and
  phases of rail and property development at lower transaction costs.
• The granting of development rights starts with small parcels above
  stations or depots primarily to generate project revenue and later
  evolves into large-scale, high-quality new towns, iconic business cen-
  ters, and local community hubs.
• Private developers cover land premiums and bear project risks for
  higher financial returns, whereas the government and rail corporation
  (to some degree) are protected from market and development risks.
• The rules for sharing costs and profits among public agencies, the
  railway corporation, and private developers are clear and sound, eas-
  ing project uncertainties and public opposition.

SAR, China’s, state leasehold system, Tokyo’s schemes operate under a
market freehold system.
  Land readjustment is mainly used on urban fringes, and urban redevel-
opment schemes in built-up areas especially, where property rights are frag-
mented (boxes O.1 and O.2). Both instruments, however, require either


  Box O.1 Integrated land readjustment for Tsukuba Express

  Under the Housing-Railway Integration Law, municipal governments and housing agencies can des-
  ignate special land readjustment areas along future railway lines. In this scheme, several landowners
  within the designed areas give up and reserve percentages of their land for public uses, including the
  transit facilities or land sales to generate funds for public investments (figure BO.1.1). The economic
  rationale is that although the original landowners receive smaller land parcels, these parcels would
  have higher land values thanks to a new station and other local infrastructure and service provision.
  Railway companies can smoothly acquire the rights of way for their transit investment and promote
  transit-supportive housing developments through the land readjustment practices.

     Under the Urban Redevelopment Law, landholders, tenants, and developers can create development
     opportunities in built-up areas, typically where a transit station exists or has newly opened. To capture
     the potential accessibility benefits conferred by the transit station, the local government first converts
     zoning codes from single use to mixed use with higher floor area ratios (figure BO.2.1).

     Before the urban redevelopment project, the site consisted of several small parcels owned by indi-
     vidual landowners and occupied with different tenants. Most houses are one- or two-story structures
     because each parcel is too small to replace the old building with a taller building, and the landowners
     do not have the capital or expertise to do so. This urban redevelopment project consists of construc-
     tion of a taller, higher-quality building on land prepared by assembling small parcels; construction of
     an underground metro station; and provision of public infrastructure (such as wider roads, a station
     plaza, and amenities). The national government finances a third of site survey, land assembly, and
     open space foundation costs, using the national general budget, and half the public infrastructure
     costs using the roadway special fund. Through this process, the original landholders and building

    owners are entitled to keep the property rights of floor spaces in the new building that are valued

    rights from the original owners to accelerate the redevelopment). The “surplus” floor area permitted

   The world’s largest metropolis has adapted LVC to match the variety
of stakeholders, locations, time periods, and scales over the world’s most
expansive railway network. Tokyo’s rich transit-oriented experiences offer
the following lessons:

    •	 The national government’s master plan leads to polycentric regional
       development and railway extension strategies, even though multiple
       public, private, and semi-private entities use different development
       approaches and LVC techniques in the same metropolitan area. All
       stakeholders need to share a clear vision and take collective actions.
    •	 Both the land readjustment and urban redevelopment schemes require
       a consensus building that is often very thorough and time-consuming.
       And smooth implementation relies on traditional social ties and ade-
       quate economic incentives. The power of eminent domain can help
       practitioners speed land assembly, but careless application could gen-
       erate long-lasting social tensions and feelings of mistrust.
    •	 Entrepreneurial railway agencies should also acquire expertise not
       only for conventional system engineering but also for real estate

                            investment, town planning, and marketing to set appropriate develop-
                            ment parameters, analyze market profiles, offer multiple services, and
                            maximize value increments in their station properties and wider catch-
                            ment areas. Essentially, railway agencies need to be entitled to keep
                            the long-term ownership and stewardship of properties to generate
                            recurring revenues from both development and service activities
                            around stations.
                         •	 The rights of way for a new railway line can be assembled cost-effi-
                            ciently by railway agencies and local governments through land readjust-
                            ment projects, especially in areas where local residents are waiting for
                            new railway access. This approach can promote property development
                            along the new line to achieve targeted ridership and fare revenues.
                         •	 Major landholders or developers in a designated district can foster
                            land readjustment projects. With their real estate knowledge and
                            resources, they are more likely to invest in local infrastructure, take
                            strong initiatives in planning, and maximize the value of their land
                            around a new station.
                         •	 To create high-quality built environments around a station, substan-
                            tial density bonuses should be provided. Private transit agencies and
                            developers are encouraged to supply social infrastructure and ser-
                            vices, maximize synergies, and mitigate redistributive impacts through
                            inclusive urban redevelopment. They can provide human-scale built
                            environments within the superblocks already constructed in many
                            developing countries.
                         Tokyo’s multiple techniques provide lessons for the rapidly growing cit-
                      ies of developing countries.


                      Critical Factors for Success in Developing Countries
                      Case studies of cities that have creatively pursued development-based LVC
                      to finance transit and transit-oriented development in both developed and
                      developing countries highlight the unique contexts and challenges of cre-
                      ating and sharing land values for transit financing and transit-oriented
                      development. The insights from these experiences point to policy recom-
                      mendations and implementation measures that deserve careful consider-
                      ation at different levels of strategic decisions. They also highlight policy
                      decisions, planning exercises, and project development in applying devel-
                      opment-based LVC in developing countries.

                      Key Findings
                      Inclusive Value Creation
                      The rationale behind development-based LVC is creating and sharing incre-
                      mental value among the governments, transit agencies, developers, busi-
                      nesses, and residents in and around stations. This obviously differs from
                      tax- or fee-based capturing of “windfalls” from private property owners,
	                                                                                                Overview   13



as practiced in North America and other parts of the world. The Japanese
expression of development-based LVC (“開発利益還元”) literally means
“returning profit generated by development,” rather than having the gov-
ernment or transit company unilaterally capture the land value increments
from landowners or developers. Development-based LVC is designed and
implemented around the incentives of various stakeholders. This shared
interest facilitates various complex property development processes such as
acquiring land and authorizing land use change and zoning codes. Unlike
most tax- or fee-based LVC instruments, evaluating increment value in
development-based LVC is not a unilateral decision by municipalities. The
land price is agreed on by all parties up-front based on market trends, and
the distribution of profit is decided though negotiations, based on the con-
tribution of each stakeholder.

Public Land Ownership Is Important but not Absolutely Necessary
Development-based LVC is a value creation exercise rather than a simple
sale of public land or lease of land use rights. Even under a market free-
hold system, municipalities and transit agencies that do not own land can
acquire land through incentive-based techniques such as “land readjust-
ment” or “urban redevelopment,” as applied in Tokyo. These can generate
land values exceeding the land purchase costs by exploring undeveloped
economic opportunities through densification, transit, and other transit-
supportive investments. New York City and São Paulo are also exploring
vertical development opportunities by leveraging air rights of the lands
owned by private landowners in densely built-up districts (box O.3).


    Box O.3  Air rights sales in São Paulo

    Brazil is a pioneer in air rights sales, but these sales have rarely been adapted to finance transit or
    transit-oriented development related investments in São Paulo.
        In Brazil, a private landowner cannot freely develop air rights above a certain floor area ratio (usu-
    ally between 1.0 and 2.0 in São Paulo) without paying for the costs of the impact of the air rights use.
    The logic behind selling air rights is that owners should contribute to infrastructure construction costs
    in proportion to the volume of their air rights use, as higher densities require additional infrastructure
    investments. Certificates of Additional Construction Potential (CEPACs) are sold by auction as a trad-
    able financial security, and they are applicable only to designated urban districts, with the revenues
    to finance predetermined urban infrastructure. Through the issue of CEPACs, municipalities can raise
    infrastructure investment funds by selling the bearer additional building rights—such as a larger floor
    area ratio and possible land use changes—that would induce private investments to adjust to the
    transformations desired in urban development policy.
        São Paulo’s highly indebted financial position forced city authorities to generate funds for infra-
    structure without increasing debt. Unlike many cities in developing countries, São Paulo cannot raise
    revenue by selling land because it possesses little developable land. So, air rights sales are one of a few
    possible measures for São Paulo to raise funds for infrastructure investments. By auctioning CEPACs,
    the city can allocate limited air rights according to market needs at a price to be fixed by market demand.
                                                                                       (continued next page)
14    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values




   Box O.3  Air rights sales in São Paulo   (continued)
       Except for a few minor investments, CEPAC revenues have not been used for metro construction.
   Nor have allocations of CEPACs been linked to railway station areas. So, CEPACs have not always cap-
   tured the increments of land value attributable to metro construction. Further, the state government
   and the city government are not controlled by the same political party, making coordination between
   transit agencies and the urban planning department difficult. Even in the same transport sector, rail-
   way transit companies owned by the São Paulo State and bus companies owned by the municipality
   seem to compete rather than collaborate. Due to lack of coordination between transit agencies and
   city planning bureaus as well as agencies’ railway-centered engineering approaches, transit agen-
   cies often miss out on great opportunities to explore the use of air rights above stations to generate
   revenues. Given the tight budget situation and legal restrictions, metro company engineers tend to
   design metro stations according to minimum structural specifications requiring the least investment
   costs. But these developments cannot support the type of multipurpose use terminal building that
   could generate sizable lease revenues and increase transit ridership.
       Although São Paulo currently faces these planning and institutional challenges, there is great
   potential to adapt development-based LVC for transit investment and to shape urban form and
   develop articulated densities suitable for future transit-oriented development. This approach has
   already been adapted in the “Linha Verde” (Green Line) Urban Operation in Curitiba, where a major
   national highway was converted into an urban avenue with the extension of a bus rapid transit green
   line and higher density land uses. CEPAC revenues partially financed the investment costs of this
   transit-oriented development project (Smolka 2013). In São Paulo, the Metro has already started to
   study the possibility of using air rights sales to finance new metro construction in the Vila Sonia Urban
   Consortia (Fróes and Rebelo 2006).
       In addition, São Paulo’s city planners are now considering to reduce the overcrowded commuting
   movement between suburbs and city centers by developing subdevelopment centers to balance busi-
   ness and residential densities across the city area (Região da Jacu-Pêssego as a new commercial center
   and Região da Cupecê for both commercial and residential use), based on the transit-oriented develop-
   ment concept where developable lands are still available. As the demand for good quality housing at
   the mid-market segment is very high because of rapid household income increase in Brazil, land prices
   close to transit stations could increase due to good accessibility and connectivity. If the municipal gov-
   ernment and transit agencies collaborate and coordinate with investors and developers, as their coun-
   terparts in Hong Kong SAR, China, and Tokyo have been doing, they would be able to raise revenues to
   recoup a portion of the transit and other transit-oriented development related investment costs.


                         For cities with a state leasehold system, strategic public land use is imper-
                      ative for successful development-based LVC implementation. Public land is
                      a finite resource in cities—especially growing ones—and would be hastily
                      exhausted if municipalities sold it for short-term cash flow. Municipalities
                      as landholders must therefore strategically manage limited public land, tak-
                      ing into account long-term development benefits. The Hong Kong SAR,
                      China, MTR captures the land value increment created by R+P not by sell-
                      ing the development rights, but by partnering with private developers, sell-
                      ing the completed property units, and finally capturing the value through
                      the sharing of profits. In this sense, regardless of the differences between
                      the respective landholding systems, both the Hong Kong SAR, China, MTR
                      and the Japanese railway companies have been undertaking development-
                      based LVC, based on creating and sharing value.
	                                                                                             Overview   15



Sound Planning Principles
Revenue maximization is important because developable land is scarce in
rapidly growing cities, but development-based LVC should be based on
sound planning principles that increase the benefit of society as a whole.
If these schemes are co-opted by cities to simply raise money, and not to
try to plan cities sustainably, they may “distort the purposes of planning by
putting the focus on benefits extracted from developers rather than on the
actual needs of new residents and businesses” (Rahenkamp 2013). In this
context, policymakers and practitioners should design development-based
LVC so that the transaction generates land value increments that benefit soci-
ety to the greatest extent possible (box O.4). In a different context, the unin-
tended negative impact of São Paulo’s planning regulation on free FAR limit
(between 1.0 and 2.0), combined with its air rights sales on its spatial devel-
opment pattern (urban sprawl and shortage of affordable housing stocks in
the city center), should be carefully analyzed. So should the impact of Hong
Kong SAR, China’s, land lease policy on the affordability of local housing.

Enabling Factors
Macro Fundamentals
Demographic and economic fundamentals are paramount when applying
development-based LVC. Generally, it works well when rapid urban popu-
lation and strong economic growth create high demand for land and prop-
erty prices increase. But even under slow economic growth, municipalities
and transit agencies can adapt it to maximize accessibility and agglomera-
tion premiums around selected station areas where the economic potential
has not yet been fully realized due to inadequate land uses and outdated
zoning codes.
   The emergence of middle-income households—and high housing
demand—can justify large-scale investment in rail extensions to suburbs


    Box O.4  Development rights leases in Nanchang, China

    Chinese cities have long converted rural agricultural land to urban land equipped with infrastructure
    and then leased the development rights for a premium. And as in many other Chinese cities, revenues
    from development rights leases are the major public finance source of infrastructure investments in
    Nanchang. But Nanchang, one of several forward-looking Chinese cities, is using development-based
    LVC schemes to promote transit-oriented development by creating articulated densities around major
    metro station areas. The idea is to maximize development rights lease revenues to recoup new metro
    investment costs by promoting efficient land use around stations through zoning changes for mixed
    use with higher floor area ratios—and to promote sustainable urban development through transit-
    oriented development.
        Nanchang’s practice is more sustainable than the typical rural-urban land conversion, which runs
    the risk of unnecessarily expanding cities outward, leading to urban sprawl. As this scheme has not
    yet been fully implemented, it is still too early to know whether it will generate the desired financial
    and urban development outcomes. But if successful, Nanchang’s scheme could provide a good model
    for other Chinese cities.
16    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values



                      and generate up-front value increments along new corridors. The metro
                      corporations in Nanchang and Hyderabad are taking advantage of their
                      growth, as Japanese private railways exercised development-based LVC for
                      the initial infrastructure investments in the 1960s and Hong Kong SAR,
                      China’s, MTR Corporation in the 1980s.
                         Both Tokyo and Hong Kong SAR, China, could generate steady recur-
                      ring revenues, even during periods of slow economic growth, since their
                      instruments were well positioned for long-term development benefits rather
                      than short-term financial gain. Tokyo’s development-based LVCs are still
                      being undertaken, thanks to market demand to consolidate land parcels for
                      redevelopment and regenerate property values in selected strategic built-up
                      areas with high economic potential.
                         Economic restructuring from low-cost manufacturing to knowledge-
                      and service-based industries, as in Nanchang and Hyderabad, also provides
                      greater opportunities to capture accessibility and agglomeration benefits
                      around stations, where firms and workers can explore value-added busi-
                      ness opportunities through agglomeration. Indeed, the competitive advan-
                      tage of international and regional businesses in Tokyo, New York, and
                      London has shifted toward central locations thanks to recent urban regen-
                      eration programs, taking advantage of strong infrastructure reinvestments,
                      land use deregulation, and tax incentives.

                      Visionary Master Plans
                      A master plan needs to provide a long-term vision of development shared
                      among all members of a city. Policymakers must emphasize transit infra-
                      structure as the spine of spatial development strategies in their visionary
                      plans, helping guide planning, funding, construction, and operations in a
                      way that supports transit. This long-term development vision should be
                      consistently reflected in other planning instruments such as diverse sector
                      plans and local master plans.
                         Master plans from the past decades of global good practice cities clearly
                      identified rail transit systems as the backbone of urban development. Hong

                      Tokyo’s latest national capital region master plan also stresses the forma-

                         To formulate and revise master plans in a pragmatic way, national gov-

                      share key information and address mutual interests. The National Capital

Region Plan of Tokyo has long coordinated potential development areas
and authorized specific transit projects among multiple local governments
and railway corporations. By contrast, the master plan of Delhi as the
national capital region has been unable to resolve many conflicting bureau-
cratic interests and unfavorable land use regulations, which significantly
blocks development-based LVC practices for the new metro system.
   Master plans should not be too prescriptive. Development parameters
depend on diverse site conditions and changing market demands, though
transit-oriented development in general has a certain set of design prin-
ciples. The overly standard and impractical criteria stipulated in the master
plans of Delhi (maximum FAR of 1.0 at metro stations) have reduced or
completely negated the opportunities for developers to coordinate better
layout plans and maximize accessibility to their real estate.
   In addition to the metropolitan master plans, there are various sector or
local master plans across government departments and agencies. Such sub-
plans must be consistent vertically among national, metropolitan, and local
governments—and horizontally among departments of urban planning,
land administration, transport, economic development, and housing—all
under one consistent vision. For example, new transit investments cannot
create enough ridership and associated land value if subplans encourage
public spending on massive roadway systems and automobile-dependent
housing development. In Hong Kong SAR, China, and Tokyo, transit-sup-
portive policies and investment have been endorsed throughout a subset of
sector plans or local master plans.

Flexible Zoning
Development-based LVC facilitates negotiations among planning authori-
ties, transit companies, developers, landowners, and local stakeholders
for mutual interests and benefits. So zoning codes and site design param-
eters around stations should be flexible enough to meet changing market
demands and diverse local needs.
   Zoning systems can provide flexible and negotiable codes with minimum
standards to target station areas, allowing transit companies and devel-
opers to adjust site-design parameters. In Hong Kong SAR, China, Com-
prehensive Development Areas have been designated around key stations
as set out in the MTR Corporation’s Master Layout Plan to coordinate
more complex, integrated mixed-use development packages and to flex-
ibly exercise the financially viable R+P program. Tokyo’s urban regenera-
tion districts were designated to attract private real estate investments with
generously relaxed development codes around the former rail yard sites
(maximum FAR over 10.0, height deregulation, and expedited approvals).
   In many developing countries, outdated land use plans or inconsistent
regulations enforced by planning and statutory authorities deter transit
agencies and real estate companies from exploring development opportuni-
ties in and around stations. For example, the Delhi Development Authority
has strictly fixed maximum building coverage at 25 percent, with a FAR of
18    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values



                      1.0 for any development activities at metro station areas. But under the new
                      draft master plan (MPD-2021), it is proposing to allocate a higher FAR in
                      the metro influence zones outside metro station sites. One official justifica-
                      tion for the strict development regulations in Delhi is that increasing the
                      maximum FAR around stations generates additional trips and exacerbates
                      traffic congestion. But newly attracted travelers are more likely to choose
                      transit and nonmotorized travel modes in origins and destinations near sta-
                      tions. Indeed, the most typical issue preventing flexible land use is the con-
                      flict of development interests inside and outside station areas.
                          Relaxing development regulations around stations alone does not ensure
                      transit-supportive land use. To achieve this, municipalities and transit agen-
                      cies need to coordinate the physical integration of rail station facilities with
                      private property development and surrounding neighborhoods. Such inte-
                      gration can enhance a transit’s accessibility and produce greater revenues
                      from both transit farebox collections and development-based LVC schemes.
                      In Delhi, nevertheless, a residential condominium project undertaken by a
                      private developer along the metro depot is filled predominately with lux-
                      ury 3–5 bedroom units having about four parking spaces per household.
                      This can be regarded as transit-adjacent development rather than transit-
                      oriented development (box O.5).



   Box O.5  Government-led development-based land value capture for India’s first metro
   system in Delhi
   The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is India’s first metro system, extending over 190 kilome-
   ters with 144 stations. It has enjoyed very strong political and financial support from the national
   government, which leased land owned by various ministries and public agencies to DMRC for metro
   construction over a 99-year period at an intergovernmental transfer rate lower than the market rate.
   The government provided the land for property development to finance 11 percent of the construc-
   tion costs of the first two phases. The government also provided the remaining financing, including
   budgetary support, together with the Delhi government, and secured yen loans from the Japan Inter-
   national Cooperation Agency by providing a sovereign guarantee. DMRC reports only to the Ministry
   of Urban Development, which coordinates with other relevant ministries and agencies, while DMRC
   holds all the decision-making power for metro construction and operation.
       But Delhi’s complex governance and regulatory framework is a direct result of multiple layers of
   government stakeholders—the national government, Delhi government with three municipalities, and
   the Delhi Development Authority (DDA; a state enterprise in charge of land management and poli-
   cies, under the Ministry of Urban Development)—which has adversely affected the implementation of
   development-based LVC. While the national cabinet mandated DMRC to carry out property develop-
   ment projects to finance its construction cost, DMRC had difficulty obtaining development approval
   from different authorities such as DDA and the municipal government for the floor area ratio modifi-
   cation, the land use change for property development, and the construction permits. Effectively, the
   decision of the national government is being blocked by lower governments and planning and land
   management agencies that have statutory approval powers over the change of land use or construc-
   tion permit. While DDA approved the land use for the right of way, it often rejected DMRC’s applica-
   tions for the land use change for property development.

Multiple Funding Sources
Development-based LVC should not be regarded as a single funding source
to fill any funding gaps. In theory, the primary funding source for transit
systems must be the fare revenue that can be increased by adopting transit-
oriented development principles around stations. But few transit agencies in
the world can cover even their operation and maintenance costs with fare
revenues alone. The capital intensity of transit investment further increases
the financing challenges for municipalities and transit agencies. Given the
broader economic, environmental, and social roles of transit systems, includ-
ing a range of externalities and social benefits, governments should help tran-
sit agencies close their financial gaps by mobilizing diverse funding sources.
    Development-based LVC accounts for a substantial portion of transit
finance in Hong Kong SAR, China, and Tokyo. But it should not be consid-
ered as a single financing source to cover expensive transit costs. As trans-
port economists have long argued, the primary funding source for transit
systems should be fare revenue, which should ideally increase with effec-
tive transit-oriented development. Railway finance models in Hong Kong
SAR, China; Tokyo; Nanchang; Delhi; and Hyderabad assume that fare
revenues will fully cover operation and maintenance costs and partially
cover construction costs, primarily thanks to adequate passenger demand
driven from their high-density passenger catchment areas. But even in such
an exceptionally high-density area as Hong Kong SAR, China, the MTR
Corporation sometimes relies on government cash grants when the R+P
scheme cannot fill a funding gap, especially because of the scarcity of devel-
opable land parcels along new lines.
    Land prices by their nature are volatile in response to changing economic
and political climates, which are beyond the control of local governments
or transit agencies. So a variety of alternative funding sources should be
available to mitigate the risks of volatile land prices, through diversification
of funding sources, and to prepare contingent financing sources in case of
lower revenues from development-based LVC. Diversified funding arrange-
ments can ensure the provision of transit infrastructure and services for the
long term.
    Any special funds run the risk of being captured by special interests—
sometimes for economically unjustifiable investment, as with economically
nonviable highway construction funded by a road fund. But if designed well,
special funds could support governments’ planning objectives and address
externalities. For example, governments could apply a gasoline tax or auto-
mobile charge as strategic funding arrangements to supplement transit and
transit-oriented development related investments and discourage automo-
bile use. Tokyo’s Roadway Special Fund—comprising earmarked gasoline
charges and vehicle registration fees—financed one-third of transit-related
bridge and underpass construction to reduce traffic congestion and upgrade
station facilities to improve local feeder access, pedestrian circulation, and
street amenities, along with the land readjustment and urban redevelop-
ment schemes.
20    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values



                         Among several funding sources, property taxes are particularly impor-
                      tant for municipal governments, transit agencies, developers, landholders,
                      and commercial entities around stations. Such taxes not only support the
                      provision of infrastructure and services but also determine the distribution
                      of development benefits in and around station facilities. Indeed, the special
                      exemption of property tax for railway development and railway-associated
                      businesses have been debated in Tokyo and Delhi, since railway corpora-
                      tions take advantage of the exemption without considering the redistribu-
                      tive effects of railway and property development in and around stations.

                      Intergovernmental Collaboration
                      Development-based LVC requires multiple government entities to work
                      together to deliver innovative transit-related projects and programs, and
                      that is one of the biggest challenges in many cities of developing coun-
                      tries. One recommended approach would be for a single local government
                      body—which includes transit agencies—to coordinate planning, design,
                      land acquisition, construction, operation, and asset management to sustain
                      collaborative relationships and actions.
                          The culture of transit agencies is traditionally engineering-oriented, with
                      a focus on narrowly defined performance criteria, even though develop-
                      ment-based LVC needs expertise and intergovernmental collaboration
                      beyond transit facilities. It is crucial for transport officials to recognize the
                      financial potential and social importance of dealing with land and property
                      around their transit stations. In both Delhi and São Paulo, the national or
                      state transport bureaus have been less involved in adapting development-
                      based LVC due in part to their technical focus, the multiple layers of gov-
                      ernments (sometimes controlled by different political parties, as in São
                      Paulo), and the complicated land and development right transfers from one
                      agency to another.
                          Development-based LVC usually involves a wide range of government
                      agencies to create greater development opportunities, generating conflicts of
                      intergovernmental interests in lands and properties around stations. In many
                      capital cities, such as Delhi and São Paulo, multiple layers of governments
                      have long adopted their own legislative policies and design parameters. Delhi
                      planning authorities and statutory bodies have used their regulatory instru-
                      ments to block property development projects mandated by their national
                      government around metro stations and to prevent the full exploration of
                      development opportunities the new metro investment could bring.
                          Trusted political leaders may be able to remove such intergovernmental
                      barriers and regulatory constraints by bringing all stakeholders together.
                      But such a top-down approach might not always work well in democratic
                      cities. In addition to political support, it is important that one government
                      body acts as a coordinator to deal with land-related legislative tasks across
                      agencies. In Hyderabad, a transit agency is a liaison to ensure that a pri-
                      vate partner can smoothly obtain land for metro construction and prop-
                      erty development by coordinating with several municipalities, traffic and

police departments, and utility agencies for multiple statutory clearances
(box O.6).

Entrepreneurship
Transit agencies need to become entrepreneurial as they manage development-
based LVC’s evolving process from a simple tool of short-term corporate or
project finance to a strategic model of long-term urban finance and develop-
ment—mainstreaming property development and asset management around
stations as a part of their businesses. To ensure the sustainability of these
property-related businesses, transit companies have to develop a consensus
with other stakeholders on the ownership of and responsibilities for land
and property management in and around stations.
   Development-based LVC was originally an entrepreneurial undertak-
ing in the mid-19th century in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Around the turn of the 20th century, a few entrepreneurs in Japanese cities
began adapting the classic private railway and land development business
model. Since then, more railway corporations have evolved development-
based LVC from a simple tool of short-term project finance to a strategic


    Box O.6  World’s largest public-private metro project in Hyderabad

    Hyderabad, the largest historical city of southern India, home of 7 million citizens and prosperous
    information technology industries, is implementing the world’s largest public-private partnership
    (PPP) for a metro project, extending 77 kilometers and with 66 stations. The PPP project is being
    implemented in the form of design-build-finance-operate-and-transfer under a 35-year concessionary
    agreement between Hyderabad Metro Rail Ltd. (HMR) and Larsen and Toubro Limited (L&T; one of
    the largest contractors and developers in India). HMR is a Special Project Vehicle set up by the state
    government of Andhra Pradesh to coordinate and manage the project. Through HMR, the state gov-
    ernment and the municipality provided L&T with the right-of-way for metro construction and land for
    property development (109 hectares) close to the metro stations.
        L&T will finance most of the metro construction costs ($2.7 billion) and expects to recover them
    over a 35-year concession, extendable for 25 years. Revenue sources include fare revenues (50 per-
    cent of the total), property development (45 percent of total revenues from 109 hectares of leased
    land), and a viability gap fund (VGF), which receives subsidies from the national government to fill
    the financial gap of the PPP project and others. The criterion for selecting the concessioner was the
    amount of VGF requested by the bidders. L&T, which requested the smallest VGF ($320 million), won
    the award. The Hyderabad Metro Project is a unique example of a PPP using development-based LVC
    as its financing scheme.
        Hyderabad’s institutional and regulatory framework is less complicated than Delhi’s and more
    straightforward. On the government’s side, stakeholders such as the heads of various departments of
    the government of Andhra Pradesh—including the Chief Secretary, the Commissioner representing
    Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, and the Managing Director of HMR—sit on the board of
    HMR. HMR is assuming the role of a one-stop-shop representing the governments vis-à-vis L&T, the
    PPP concessionaire. This well-coordinated institutional framework ensures that a consistent vision,
    strategy, and policy facilitates various steps of the project, such as provision of state land, acquisition
    of land, and permission for land use changes. And the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh provides
    strong leadership and political support.

                      model of long-term urban finance and development across the Tokyo Met-
                      ropolitan Area.
                         Transit agencies are typically established as public sector entities in cit-
                      ies of both developed and developing countries since urban transit on its
                      own is seldom profitable enough. This is due in part to high land acquisi-
                      tion costs and competition with other transport modes, particularly auto-
                      mobiles. Even so, encouraging private entrepreneurship through different
                      degrees of privatization in the provision of transit infrastructure and ser-
                      vices could support such a public sector undertaking. In Hong Kong SAR,
                      China, the MTR Corporation is highly entrepreneurial in exercising its R+P
                      program, though the government as a beneficial owner keeps 76.7 percent
                      of the MTR shares issued under the control of the Financial Secretary to
                      ensure broader public interests. The privatization of the Japanese National
                      Railways in 1987 brought a more business-oriented corporate culture and
                      entrepreneurial business model, exemplified by large-scale private redevel-
                      opment of rail yard sites near strategic terminal stations.
                         In the portfolios of entrepreneurial transit agencies or private railway
                      companies, real estate and other related business practices have accounted
                      for more than one-third of their recurring profits over the last decade—
                      38 percent between 2000 and 2012 for Hong Kong SAR, China’s, MTR
                      Corporation and 34 percent between 2003 and 2013 for Tokyo’s Tokyu
                      Corporation. The diversification of corporate portfolios also reveals that
                      railway companies can be passenger service providers, real estate develop-
                      ers, and town planners through the implementation of development-based
                      LVC in broader urban contexts. Indeed, high-profile railway agencies in
                      progressive cities such as Hong Kong SAR, China; Tokyo; Washington,
                      DC; Nanchang; and Hyderabad have accumulated knowledge by recruiting
                      not only transport engineers, but also real estate experts and urban planners
                      and designers.
                         The MTR Corporation is an example of an entrepreneurial transit
                      agency with sufficient expertise to propose site-level layout plans in and
                      around stations and control development parameters/design standards that
                      maximize the accessibility benefits conferred by stations on a case-by-case
                      basis. To assure the public interest in the private provision of infrastruc-
                      ture and services, the innovative public-private partnerships (PPPs) in cit-
                      ies of developing countries should clearly specify the obligations of private
                      partners in each of the project phases. In Hong Kong SAR, China, and
                      Tokyo, public requirements are also set up along with market incentives for
                      entrepreneurial private entities to meet local community needs through the
                      exercise of development-based LVC.

                      Clear, Fair, and Transparent Rules
                      The underlying principle of development-based LVC as practiced by Hong
                      Kong SAR, China, and Tokyo is the joint creation and sharing of land value
                      increment. Creating development opportunities among voluntary public-
                      private contributors in a collaborative effort can generate additional values
	                                                                                Overview   23



and greater synergies. Thus, it is essential to establish clear and fair rules
for sharing costs, benefits, and risks among stakeholders to ensure the long-
term commitment of public agencies and private entities to deliver transit
projects, promote transit-supportive activities, and maximize benefits in
and around stations.
   The rationale behind development-based LVC is incremental value cre-
ation and sharing among governments, transit agencies, developers, busi-
nesses, and residents in and around stations. This obviously differs from
tax- or fee-based LVC capturing “windfalls” from private property owners,
as practiced in North America and other parts of the world. Tokyo illus-
trates the need for some voluntary contributions to create greater develop-
ment opportunities for both the public and private sectors. So, in adapting
development-based LVC for local contexts of the developing world, the
rules for sharing costs, benefits, and risks must support the collaborative
actions of multiple stakeholders.
   The rules should be clear. In Hong Kong SAR, China, for example, the
MTR Corporation’s R+P model offers three options for benefit sharing
to private developers: profits in agreed proportions from the sale or lease
of properties, assets in kind, and up-front payments from developers. The
case-by-case arrangements are made according to development locations
and market conditions, but rules of thumb make it easier for developers to
work with the MTR Corporation on more complex and higher risk mixed-
use development projects for greater returns on investment around stations.
The government has also reaped substantial rewards through the transfers
of development rights to the MTR Corporation, which can be shared with
multiple departments and agencies for other social welfare programs.
   The rules must be fair and transparent. As in Delhi, the land granted
exclusively to a transit agency for development-based LVC is likely to pro-
duce intergovernmental conflicts of interest in capital cities with complex
multilayered governance structures, unless other agencies can also obtain
some development benefits in proportion to their resource contribution. To
establish a win-win relationship among stakeholders, the innovative PPP
scheme in Hyderabad attempts to ensure that the rules for sharing costs,
benefits, and risks are adhered to by clearly specifying the obligations of
government agencies and a private partner in the concession agreement.

Key Instruments
Policymakers and practitioners need to understand the basic features of
various instruments and adopt appropriate combinations of development-
based LVC techniques for the landholdings, stakeholders, periods, scales,
and localities in their cities. Among the various instruments, land readjust-
ment and urban redevelopment financing schemes—through the inclusive
process of land resource allocation and urban planning—are particularly
important for cities with a market freehold system.
24    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values



                         Cities under a state leasehold system can generally use development
                      rights sales with public requirements, as well as development incentives,
                      to achieve their planning objectives. Cities in developing countries—such
                      as China—have limited experience in property development in conjunction
                      with transit investment. As a consequence, disproportionately large-scale
                      layout plans have sometimes been adopted in station catchment areas. To
                      set up realistic site parameters and attain intended spatial outcomes around
                      stations, the MTR Corporation in Hong Kong SAR, China, maintains staff
                      expertise in property development and town planning and has updated the
                      property market profiles since the 1980s. These capacity building efforts
                      can be seen as steps for adopting development-based LVC techniques in the
                      developing world.
                         Cities under a market freehold system may be able to auction off public
                      land with development conditions for public interests as well as develop-
                      ment incentives for developers. In so doing, government agencies can raise
                      up-front capital for infrastructure development, but they do not generate
                      recurring revenues for operation and maintenance activities. Rail yard
                      redevelopment in Tokyo and London shows that either local development
                      agencies or private railway corporations should remain as stakeholders
                      to directly control the public domain and sustain property management
                      incomes in and around station facilities.
                         Land readjustment can efficiently assemble the rights of way for guided
                      transit extension projects and simultaneously promote transit-supportive
                      property development around new stations (mainly in suburban areas) if
                      all landholders agree. Similarly, inclusive urban redevelopment schemes
                      should become available with sufficient market incentives to consolidate
                      private land parcels in target built-up urban areas, and create development
                      opportunities in and around existing underused stations. Adopting inclusive
                      instruments in developing countries requires entrepreneurial transit agen-
                      cies to engage in lengthy negotiation processes, acquire knowledge about
                      the options, and establish close relationships with multiple local stakehold-
                      ers. The multiple development experiences in Tokyo highlight the need for
                      active involvement and commitment of major landholders—who are often
                      large real estate developers as well—to create greater development opportu-
                      nities and maximize the land value added by transit investment.
                         FAR distribution requires special attention as it is associated with devel-
                      opment rights sales, land readjustment projects, and inclusive redevelop-
                      ment schemes. FARs can be used as a market incentive to achieve multiple
                      policy objectives. These include the provision of infrastructure and services,
                      public open space and amenities, affordable housing units, and mixed land
                      uses in private development packages or urban regeneration districts near
                      target stations.
                         The sale of tradable air rights can raise up-front cash for cities in devel-
                      oping countries where local governments face increased public debt and
                      acute land constraints. But New York and São Paulo reveal that it is very

difficult to estimate the value of air rights and to control land use param-
eters that could directly result in transit-supportive urban forms through
market-based air rights transfers.


Challenges and Risks
Development-based LVC is a powerful financing and planning apparatus,
unlocking unexplored land value to finance transit and promote transit-
oriented development, but the risks of overreliance, corruption, and gentri-
fication should be carefully addressed.

Overreliance
Overreliance on development-based LVC exposes municipalities and tran-
sit companies to excessive risk in real estate markets. While a robust real
estate market and rising land prices are good for development-based LVC,
both governments and transit agencies should adopt sound funding strate-
gies and financial management, especially when property markets indicate
excessive speculation. Given the unpredictability of the real estate market,
municipalities and transit companies should estimate the revenue to be
generated from development-based LVC schemes based on cautious and
realistic assumptions, taking market trends into account. But in the face of
rapid urbanization, transit investment cannot wait for the market. So, gov-
ernments should prepare contingent plans in case revenues are lower than
projected—preparing alternative funding sources or adjusting the sequence
of investments based on technical and economic consideration.

Corruption
In general, the perception of land transfers from the public to private sec-
tor is negative among citizens in many developing countries because of a
lack of transparency. For this reason, governments or transit companies
often find it difficult to secure public support for development-based LVC,
especially from those living in the targeted property development areas. To
secure public support, governments should raise public awareness of the
chosen scheme and its objectives, principles, rules, and regulations. It is also
important for governments to involve civil society organizations in front-
end planning and postproject development activities.
   Governments should also introduce a transparent monitoring and
recording system for development-based LVC transactions. Stakeholders
and citizens should have access to information on how the private develop-
ment partner has been selected, what are the projected actual revenues, and
how the revenues will be used. Probably the most important way to prevent
potential corruption is to require that transactions be at the market prices
based on independent assessment. For example, in Hong Kong SAR, China,
the land price assessed by the government is not arbitrary—it is a market
price based on independent, highly sophisticated land valuation principles
26    Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values



                      and practices. Transparent information systems will also help governments,
                      transit agencies, and developers prepare future development-based LVC
                      schemes, by making the relevant market data available for them.

                      Gentrification
                      Land prices in and around transit stations typically rise, often displacing
                      low-income households. But transit-oriented development should not just
                      create economically efficient and environmentally friendly urban spaces. It
                      should also address urban poverty and deprivation. Where possible, city
                      authorities should pursue affordable housing and provide developers the
                      incentives to ensure that affordable housing is built close to transit stops. A
                      FAR density bonus for constructing social housing is such an incentive and
                      can be built into development-based LVC agreements.


                      Roadmap for Development-Based LVC Implementation
                      through a Gradual Approach
                      Development-based LVC is a complex operation where various public and
                      private stakeholders jointly maximize and share increments in land value
                      around transit station areas, exploring the accessibility and agglomeration
                      benefits of transit investment. It requires favorable macro conditions, a
                      strategic vision, a supportive regulatory and institutional framework, and
                      considerable expertise. Its adoption and implementation depend on the con-
                      ditions and needs of each city. The roadmap for development-based LVC
                      implementation shows the critical decisions and steps for governments and
                      their transit agencies in designing and implementing development-based
                      LVC—and the factors related to their decisions and actions (figure O.3).
                          Adapting and implementing development-based LVC requires consistent
                      policies, a strong institutional framework, a clear and transparent regu-
                      latory framework, strong planning and financial management, effective
                      design, and efficient property management. Many policymakers and prac-
                      titioners likely feel that what Hong Kong SAR, China’s, MTR Corporation
                      and Japanese railway companies have done is unmanageable in develop-
                      ing countries. But both organizations developed expertise over many years,
                      through trial and error. Other policymakers and practitioners might hesitate
                      to adopt development-based LVC schemes because of the lack of available
                      lands or the difficulty in acquiring them. Even in these situations, however,
                      transit agencies can explore the possibilities for their own land, such as
                      underground or above-station areas or depots, just as Nanchang Metro and
                      Hyderabad Metro are doing. On land under their control, municipalities or
                      transit agencies could start with a simple development-based LVC property
                      development such as a single tower office building above a transit station.
                      They could next develop a mixed-use complex, possibly with private devel-
                      opers. And they could eventually apply land readjustment or urban rede-
                      velopment schemes to develop areas adjacent to transit stations owned by

need to adjust the regulations for railway properties to allow their commer-

each municipality and to leverage internal and local assets.


What International Development Financial
Institutions Can Do
At the 2012 Rio+20 Conference, international development financial
institutions including the World Bank announced a joint commitment to
provide more than $175 billion in loans and grants to develop sustainable
transport systems in developing countries over the coming decade. While
encouraging this commitment, it can cover only a fraction of total urban
transit investment needs. For example, the total financial needs (for invest-
ment, operation, and maintenance) for the next two decades in Latin Amer-
ica are estimated at $308 billion (Ardila-Gomez, Ortegón, and Rubiano
forthcoming). Given this financial gap, international development financial

                      institutions can help national and local governments develop policies and
                      institutional capacities to tap financial resources other than public sources,
                      through unconventional financial and project development schemes. They
                      could also help countries develop their institutional and regulatory frame-
                      works and implementation capacities. And they could finance prototype
                      projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of development-based LVC. Given
                      the expertise needed for development-based LVC implementation, they
                      should collaborate with experienced transit companies like Hong Kong
                      SAR, China’s, MTR Corporation and various Japanese railway companies.
                      The institutional support also requires “bridge financing,” which allows
                      transit agencies and their partner developers to start construction before
                      development-based LVC revenues begin to flow.


                      Conclusion
                      High-quality transit is indispensable for sustainable urban development.
                      Well-integrated transit and land use fosters cities’ economic competitive-
                      ness, environmental sustainability, and social equity. More specifically,
                      transit-oriented development—which creates articulated densities around
                      transit hubs by locating amenities, employment, retail, and housing in close
                      proximity—is one of the most effective ways to achieve sustainable urban
                      development. Properties in well-designed areas gain a price premium thanks
                      to their accessibility and agglomeration benefits. Collaborative efforts of
                      municipalities, transit agencies, developers, landowners, and communities
                      can maximize this premium. In this joint value-creating exercise, municipal-
                      ities and transit agencies can contribute significantly to value creation either
                      through zoning changes (FARs and land use) or through transit investment.
                      And by adapting various development-based LVC schemes in their respec-
                      tive local context, they can recoup some of their transit investment, opera-
                      tion, and maintenance costs.
                          The rapid population increase and robust economic growth in rapidly
                      growing cities in developing countries, particularly in middle-income coun-
                      tries, are certainly favorable for development-based LVC. Regardless of
                      diverse political, institutional, and regulatory frameworks, regardless of dif-
                      ferent economic development stages and financial positions, and regardless
                      of state leasehold or market freehold systems, all cities are endowed with
                      invaluable land resources that have made them what they are. Policy mak-
                      ers, government officials, transit practitioners, developers, landowners, and
                      citizens can together decide their cities’ future—whether they continue to
                      let cars dominate their places or whether they reclaim those places for the
                      benefit of society. To reverse unsustainable development trajectories caused
                      by rapid motorization, cities can unlock unexplored land values to finance
                      transit investments and promote transit-oriented development for the well-
                      being of people today and for their sustainable future.

W     hat the literature has long been missing is a thorough, thoughtful book that translates how to
      move land value capture from the ivory towers of theory to real-world implementation. This book
comes as close to any in achieving this. It shows that land value capture holds tremendous untapped
potential as a viable and sustainable funding source for public transit improvements and leveraging
transit-supportive growth, particularly in developing cities.

T   his book will help cities in emerging economies, and those of us working with them, to tap into the
    increases in land value resulting from the economic development stirred by public investments in
infrastructure, providing opportunities to finance further public investment in infrastructure in a virtuous
cycle. This provides finance but also helps structure more sustainable cities through complementary

W     hat a timely and important book! It makes an impressive contribution to urban planning literature,
      bridging theory and practice in transit-oriented development and offering much needed practical
advice on how to structure and execute land value capture mechanisms to finance infrastructure
investment. It is invaluable for all city planners and public investors, providing pragmatic guidance
based on thorough analysis of successful efforts in Hong Kong [SAR, China] and Tokyo and emerging
efforts in places like São Paulo, Nanchang, and Hyderabad. Bravo!

T   his book identifies enabling factors from the experiences of Tokyo and other cities in promoting
    private sector railway construction and operation with revenues from development rights sales or
leases around transit stations, so-called “land value capture” (LVC). Also addressed are the risks and
challenges in applying the LVC apparatus to other cities. This book provides rich experiences of many
cities and deserves to be an essential reference for development agencies, including the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), to address transportation in megacities in developing
countries where public transit is needed as the backbone of urban development.
