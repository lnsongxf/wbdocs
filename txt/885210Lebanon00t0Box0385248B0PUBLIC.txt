I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Lebanon
       perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Lebanon regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Lebanon;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Lebanon;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Lebanon;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Lebanon.
    Use data to help inform Lebanon country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In April-May 2013, 574 stakeholders of the World Bank in Lebanon were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President/Prime
Minister/Minister, the office of a Parliamentarian; a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
196 stakeholders participated in the survey (34% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Lebanon; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Lebanon; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Lebanon.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Lebanon: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Lebanon is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in
   Lebanon, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and what best illustrates how “shared prosperity” would be achieved in Lebanon.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Lebanon, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Lebanon solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Lebanon, with which stakeholder groups
   the Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most
   resources, to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Lebanon’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, the extent Lebanon
   received value for money from the Bank’s fee-based products/services, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty three development areas, such as public sector
   governance/reform, social protection, job creation/employment, anti-corruption, and
   transport.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and
   activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its
   technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Lebanon’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Lebanon: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Lebanon in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website and whether they primarily use high
   speed or dial-up Internet connection when visiting a World Bank website. Respondents were
   asked if they used/had used the Bank’s Public information Centers (PICs) in Lebanon and to
   what extent the agree that PICs are a great source of information related to development in
   Lebanon.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Lebanon, and their geographic location.

Geographic Location

       Because of the small number of respondents from “South” and “Bekaa,” these locations
        were combined in the “South and Bekaa” category for all further anal yses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        the Appendix (see page 90). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

Collaboration with and Exposure to the World Bank
         Differences in responses to the indicator questions, based on levels of collaboration and
          exposure to the World Bank in Lebanon, can be found in Appendix D (see page 106).
          Please note that where these two factors appear to have a significant relationship with
          overall views of the Bank, it is highlighted in yellow in that table.
         Respondents from the Office of President/Prime Minister/Minister, PMUs and
          consultants working on Bank projects were most likely to indicate that they
          professionally collaborate/work with the Bank, whereas respondents from local
          governments and CSOs were significantly less likely to indicate so.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across many of these thirty-three development areas. For the most part,
        respondents from the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister gave the highest
        ratings, whereas respondents from CSOs and independent government organizations
        tended to give significantly lower ratings. Those areas with significant stakeholder
        differences were:
             Transport;
             Poverty reduction;
             Gender;
             Domestic private sector development; and
             Public sector governance/reform

       Respondents across geographic locations gave statistically similar ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness in the thirty-three development areas.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Lebanon, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Lebanon. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at gender;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at anti corruption;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at food security.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Lebanon, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development.
