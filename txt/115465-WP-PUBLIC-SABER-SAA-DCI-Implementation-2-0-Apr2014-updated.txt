Purpose of SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability


SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability helps countries to identify the depth and scope of their programs and policies
for school-based management. The SABER-SAA assessment result is a quick but comprehensive review of the enabling
conditions for improved teaching and learning. As such, it allows countries to identify where to focus on improving the
programs and policies that can foster autonomy and accountability, drawing on school and student assessment information.
Countries can use the findings of SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability as a benchmark for tracking their progress in
strengthening school autonomy and accountability policies, as well as for comparing with and learning from other countries.

School autonomy and accountability is one of several domains in The World Bank’s SABER initiative. Information on SABER
can be found at
                                          http://saber.worldbank.org/index.cfm
All data produced by this initiative will be available to the public for research and analysis. However, country data will be
reviewed by The World Bank SABER team and the country’s government before information is uploaded to the SABER
website.
