This report is a synthesis of findings and outputs from the SLB-Connect program, which has been operationalized by the Water and
Sanitation Program (WSP) under the aegis of the Service Level Benchmarks (SLB) program of the Ministry of Urban Development
(MoUD), Government of India. Implementation of the program was made possible by the support received from MoUD along with the
Departments of Urban Development of the Governments of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Valuable comments and
excellent support were provided by the local government authorities in all the cities covered under the project, especially the Pimpri
Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, which was a partner on this project from the pilot phase. Senior sector experts constituting the
‘SLB Connect Advisory Committee’ provided valuable inputs in setting the strategic direction of this initiative, as also our external
partners including Dr. Renu Khosla (Center for Urban and Regional Excellence), Dr. Jagan Shah (National Institute of Urban Affairs),
Dr. Manvita Baradi (Urban Management Centre), and Dr. Kaustuv Bandopadhyaya (PRIA).

The team would like to thank William D. Kingdom (Lead Water & Sanitation Specialist), Manish Kumar (Senior Institutional Development
Specialist), Luis Alberto Andres (Lead Economist) and Luiza A. Nora (Social Development Specialist) from the World Bank, for
valuable insights and leads provided at critical stages of the project. The team appreciates the feedback and critique provided by
the peer reviewers, Simon Carl O’Meally (Senior Governance Specialist), Shankar Narayanan (Senior Social Development Specialist),
Craig P. Kullman (Senior Water & Sanitation Specialist), Shomikho Raha (Public Sector Specialist), Sudipto Sarkar (Lead Water &
Sanitation Specialist) and Hyoung Gun Wang (Senior Economist). Thanks are also due to Vandana Mehra (Communications Officer),
for support in the preparation of outreach materials and reports, and Ammini Menon (Program Assistant), for coordinating logistics
during the project implementation.

The project benefited from the committed support and effort of various consultants and implementing agencies, namely, Nidhi Batra,
Dr. Sita Shekhar, Kedar Dash, Sanjay Sangal and Kanak Tiwari, PRIA (consultant for field surveys), pManifold Business Solutions
(consultant for telephone and SMS surveys), and RMSI Private Limited (consultant for IT platform). Editorial inputs for this report
were provided by consultants, Andrew Wright and Ananda Swaroop.

Project implementation and preparation of this report has been led by Task Team Leader, Vandana Bhatnagar (Senior Institutional
Development Specialist) from the Water Team in South Asia.

    Box 2: Social accountability approaches for improving service delivery

    Social Accountability (SAc) is an approach which seeks to stimulate citizen voice and client power to make the state
    and service providers accountable for meeting their service delivery obligations. Numerous SAc instruments have been
    developed in recent years, such as citizen report cards, community score cards, community monitoring of public service
    delivery, participatory budgeting and public expenditure tracking, public commissions, hearings and citizen advisory
    boards. These demand-side instruments differ from more conventional, supply-side mechanisms such as political checks
    and balances, accounting and auditing systems, administrative rules and legal procedures.

    Experience on the effectiveness of these tools has been mixed. They are heavily influenced by context. Recent studies
    draw a distinction between ‘tactical’ and ‘strategic’ approaches to SAc. The former tend to be localized, information-led
    approaches premised only on demand-side interventions. The more effective, strategic approach is however characterized
    by efforts to combine information access with an enabling environment, and coordinate with government reforms to
    encourage public sector effectiveness (What does the Evidence Really Say?, Jonathan Fox, GPSA Working Paper No.1,

municipalities to publicly disclose organizational, financial and operational information. The National e-Governance Plan aims to provide Information Technology
