                   Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have the potential
                   to transform business and government in Africa, driving entrepre­
                   neurship, innovation and economic growth. This new flagship report
                   – eTransform Africa – produced by the World Bank and the African
                   Development Bank, with the support of the African Union, identifies
                   best practice in the use of ICTs in key sectors of the African economy.
                   Under the theme “Transformation-Ready”, the growing contribution of
                   ICTs to Agriculture, Climate Change Adaptation, Education, Financial
                   Services, Government Services and Health is explored. In addition,
                   the report highlights the role of ICTs in enhancing African regional trade
                   and integration as well as the need to build a competitive ICT industry to
                   boost innovation, job creation and the export potential of African companies.

                   The eTransform Africa study grew out of the African Union Summit of
                   ICT Ministers, held in Addis Ababa in January 2010. At that meeting,
                   Ministers expressed their belief in the transformational power of ICTs
                   and their view that Africa was poised for a new era of growth that would
                   take advantage of the platform laid by investment in new networks over
                   the previous decade. In the 2000s, the focus had been on connectivity,
                   bringing more and more of Africa’s citizens into the information society
                   and building ever-faster connections to the rest of the world.
                   Analytical research had indicated the boost to economic and social
                   development that could come from network investment. Over the previous
                   25 years, a 10 per cent increase in the penetration rate of mobile phones
                   had been associated with a 0.8 per cent boost in GDP per capita in
                   developing countries, while the same increase in broadband networks
                   could add a further 1.4 per cent to general economic growth (World
                   Bank, 2009). In the 2010s, the focus should logically shift to transformation
                   as the penetration of ICTs deepens in the core sectors of the African
                   economy (World Bank, 2012).

                   While Ministers were hopeful of transformational change, they also expressed
                   their frustration at the lack of hard evidence of the links between invest­
                   ment in ICTs and sectoral development. There were plenty of pilot pro­
                   grammes but few of these had reached scale or shown wide-reaching impact.
                   There was a need to prioritize investment in using ICTs for sectoral
                   development, but which sectors should be first in the queue? Which business
                   models were proving successful and which pilot programmes represented
                   best practice that could be replicated and scaled up?

                  This report attempts to answer some of those questions. For the first time,
                  detailed and systematic studies have been commissioned to show how
                  ICTs are changing the landscape in different sectors, both in terms of
                  worldwide best practice and in specific experience of African economies.
                  The eight sectoral and cross-cutting reports were commissioned following
                  an international tendering process that attracted some of the best firms
                  and individuals globally. The study was directed by a project team
                  headed jointly by the African Development Bank and the World Bank.
                  The work programme kicked off with a launch meeting in Nairobi,
                  in February 2011, and continued with a review meeting in Johannesburg
                  in June 2011. As the reports and case studies have been elaborated,
                  they have been subjected to expert scrutiny both by the project team
                  and by the wider public, through the www.eTransformAfrica.org website
                  and other blogs. This philosophy of “early exposure” of results has undoubtedly
                  strengthened the final outputs through a rigorous process of review and
                  ground-truthing.

                  The involvement in this study of the two major investors in the African
                  ICT sector – the African Development Bank and the World Bank Group –
                  together with the African Union is significant because it sets out a new
                  strategy for future investment, in close coordination with client governments,
                  the private sector and other stakeholders. Although ICT infrastructure
                  investment will continue to be important (Independent Evaluation Group,
                  2011), increasingly future investment programmes will be geared to
                  the transformational use of ICTs. The outcomes will be measured not
                  in higher penetration rates but rather in outcomes such as poverty
                  reduction, creation of jobs and enterprises, increase in agricultural pro­
                  ductivity, better access to healthcare, clean water, education and so on.
                  Thus this report marks not so much the end of a study but rather
                  the start of a new phase of growth. The ICT investment programmes
                  that arise from this new growth phase will be evidence-based, demand
                  driven and stakeholder-led.

                     Of course, challenges remain. The continent largely lags behind
                     the rest of the world in terms of ICT readiness and Africa has made
                     slower progress in the past two years when compared to other regions.
                     The Arab Spring has caused a short-term decline in inward FDI in
                     the north of the continent. Pricing of ICT services, especially broad­
                     band, continues to be higher than other regions. Furthermore, the
                     growing trend towards taxing incoming international calls suggests
                     a reversion to the former view of the ICT sector as a cash cow.

                     The challenge for the next decade is to build on the mobile success
                     story and complete the transformation. This will require reducing
                     the cost of access for mobile broadband, supporting government
                     private-sector collaboration, improving the eCommerce environment,
                     enhancing ICT labor market skills, encouraging innovative business
                     models that drive employment, such as microwork and business
                     process outsourcing, and creating spaces that support ICT entrepre­
                     neurship, such as ICT incubators, and local ICT development clusters.

                Africa was once an ICT laggard, but is now becoming an ICT
                leader. In virtually every area of ICT – mobile,11 broadband, inter­
                national bandwidth, PC penetration – Africa is closing the gap with
                the rest of the world and in some areas, like mobile financial services,
                it is setting the pace. The studies in this report document a huge
                amount of local-level innovation, both in adapting applications
                developed in the rest of the world to African circumstances and in
                developing new home-grown applications. But there is insufficient
                south–south learning. It remains the case that African leaders are
                more likely to look outside their continent for role models than to
                look at the successes happening next door.

                Ironically, south–south learning is already happening in Africa,
                but not so much among its leaders as among its young people.
                Social networks, like Twitter, Facebook and Africa’s home-grown
                MXit provide a platform for informal learning to take place in an
                environment of fun and experimentation. It is a commonplace
                to say that Africa’s greatest strength is its youth, but in this case
                it is really true. As the generation of Africans that have grown up
                with mobile phones and social media enter the labour market and
                government, they will bring with them the habits of information sharing
                that they have grown up with. That will be a real eTransformation.
