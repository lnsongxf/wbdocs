I. Objectives

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Lao PDR
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Lao PDR regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Lao PDR;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Lao PDR;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Lao PDR; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Lao PDR.

       Use data to help inform the Lao PDR country team’s strategy.




II. Methodology
In April and May, 1,017 stakeholders of the World Bank in Lao PDR were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Government’s
Office; Ministry Cabinet offices; the National Assembly; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; international NGOs;
mass-based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; local non-profit
associations; academia, research institutes or think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of
532 stakeholders participated in the country survey (52%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Lao PDR, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in Lao PDR, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Lao PDR:

A. General Issues facing Lao PDR: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Lao PDR is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Lao PDR.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
    with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Lao PDR, Bank staff preparedness, the
    extent to which the Bank meets Lao PDR’s need for knowledge services and financial
    instruments, the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development
    agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to
    which the Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate
    the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources,
    the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
    instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Lao PDR, with which groups the Bank should
    work more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
    the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Lao PDR and the Bank’s
    level of effectiveness across thirty-two development areas, such as economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
    consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
    efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
    how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, the
    Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise, and the extent to which
    specific Bank products contribute to helping solve Lao PDR’s development challenges.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
    a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
    “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. Specific Project/Program Related Issues: Respondents were asked to rate their agreement
    with various statements regarding the World Bank’s involvement in Nam Theun 2 and the
    Lao PDR Poverty Reduction Support Operation Series (PRSO).
G. The Future Role of the World Bank in Lao PDR: Respondents were asked to rate how
    significant a role the Bank should play in Lao PDR’s development in the near future and to
    indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Lao PDR.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
    get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
    information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
    Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
    Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
    that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
    Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
    from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
    specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
    to the Bank in Lao PDR, and their geographic location.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 334 respondents (39% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY 2008 and the 115 respondents (53% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of consultants working on Bank-supported
       projects were combined with respondents from PMUs, respondents from bilateral
       agencies were combined with those from multilateral agencies, respondents from the
       financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector, and the
       few respondents from independent government institutions and the judiciary branch were
       included in the “Other” category. Note there were no respondents from private
       foundations.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in the Vientiane
        Capital. Because of the small number of respondents from provinces and districts, these
        locations were combined into a “Province/District” category for all further analyses.
       Responses across both geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in the Appendix (see page 87). Only significant differences between geographic locations
        in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

Familiarity with the World Bank

   Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.0, this was
    significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’03 country survey (6.4), but
    significantly higher than the mean rating received in the FY ’08 country survey (5.2).
         Respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and consultants on
          Bank projects/PMUs indicated the highest levels of familiarity whereas respondents
          from international NGOs and local non-profit associations indicated significantly
          lower levels.
         It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
          significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
          effectiveness in Lao PDR, the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development
          results, and the Bank’s relevance to Lao PDR’s development.

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Lao PDR, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-two specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Lao PDR. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at governance.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Lao
        PDR, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. There
        was one area determined to be a key driver from this analysis:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.
