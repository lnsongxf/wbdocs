                                         Welcome to this tenth edition of the Paying Taxes
                                         study which draws on up to eleven years’ worth of
                                         data from 189 economies.

                                         Since the ğrst edition of Paying Taxes, and
                                         especially following the global ğnancial crisis,
                                         the media, the public and many policymakers
                                         have become increasingly interested in how

allows the study to evaluate both the cost of the
taxes that are borne by the case study company
and the administrative burden of taxes borne and
collected using three sub-indicators:

• Total Tax Rate is the measure of tax cost,
  thebtotal of all taxes borne as a percentage
  ofbcommercial proğt;5
• the time to comply with the three main taxes
  (corporate income taxes, labour taxes and
  mandatory contributions, and consumption
  taxes); this captures the time required to
  prepare, ğle and pay each tax type;

  Commercial proĺt is essentially net proĺt before all taxes borne. ,t differs from the conventional proĺt before tax, reported in ĺnancial statements. ,n
  computing proĺt before tax, many of the taxes borne by a company are deductible. Commercial proĺt is calculated as sales minus cost of goods sold, minus
  gross salaries, minus administrative expenses, minus other expenses, minus provisions, plus capital gains from the property sale, minus interest expense,
  plus interest income and minus commercial depreciation. To compute the commercial depreciation, a straightline depreciation method is applied, with the
  following rates 0% for the land, 5% for the building, 10% for the machinery, 33% for the computers, 20% for the of ĺce eTuipment, 20% for the truck and 10%
  for business development expenses. Commercial proĺt amounts to 59.4 times *1,pc in each economy, by assumption of the case study ĺrm.

The Slovak Republic’s ğrst attempt to introduce
electronic ğling of taxes was in 2005. For the ğrst
several years, however, companies continued to
prefer ğling and paying taxes in person. But as the
electronic system was improved, more taxpayers
began to use it, and in 2011 the Slovak Republic
made electronic ğling mandatory for health and
social insurance contributions for companies with
more than 20 employees. By that time electronic
payment of taxes was already widespread.
Electronic ğling was also expected to be made
mandatory for VAT in 2011, but the deadline was
postponed several times. Not until -anuary 2014
did the majority of companies start ğling VAT
returns electronically.

23   Paying Taxes 2016. PwC commentary
While there is increasing recognition of the contribution that businesses
make to the societies in which they operate, and an appetite by businesses
to show how they make this contribution through the various taxes
that they pay and collect, there is still a need for tax systems to be as
straightforward and efğcient as possible.

In PwC’s 18th Annual Global CEO Survey,27 tax remains in the top ğve
of the perceived issues for business, with seven in ten CEOs (70%)
somewhat or extremely concerned about the increasing tax levied on
their businesses. For many business leaders, the primary tax focus is still
often corporate income taxes, but for the operation of a business, other
taxes such as VAT, sales taxes, labour taxes and social contributions
and sundry other taxes including property taxes and environmental
levies can increase compliance time and have a signiğcant impact on the
bottombline.

Paying Taxes takes into account all of the different business taxes that
affect our case study company, and in this section we comment on how
the cost and compliance burden of these taxes have changed around the
world both in the last year and over the period covered by the ten editions
of Paying Taxes. We also include in-depth case studies for Azerbaijan,
Mexico, Poland, Uruguay and =ambia.

     The movements in Total Tax Rate refer to a movement exhibited by the Total Tax Rates when rounded to one decimal place. Where the economy’s Total Tax
     Rate is the weighted average of the Total Tax Rate of two cities, the movements in the Total Tax Rates of the separate cities may differ. For example in Mexico,
     Mexico City’s Total Tax Rate increased by 0.019 percentage points while Monterrey’s decreased by 0.376 percentage points.

From the charts in Appendix 2 it can be seen
that the high average Total Tax Rate and time
to comply in South America is due to it being a
region of extremes. Brazil has the greatest time
to comply in the world of 2,600 hours, while
Suriname has the lowest time to comply for the
region of just 199 hours. Similarly, Argentina’s
Total Tax Rate of 137.4% is the highest in the
region and the second highest in the world while
the lowest in the region is Suriname’s at 27.9%.

From 2004, the global averages for all three sub-
indicators for the original 174 economies have
decreased steadily in almost every year. We can
see that the pace of change has slowed, but not
stopped, and one of the reasons for this is the
variation that we are now seeing in how tax reform
is being applied in different economies and regions
as discussed earlier, and in the detailed regional
sections that follow.

the regions in average time to comply, with a drop
of 234 hours across the region. South America
continues to be the outlier of the regions, largely
due to Brazil’s time to comply sitting at 2,600
hours, along with Bolivia’s time to comply at 1025
hours which is the second highest in the world.
Even taking these two countries out of the South
America average, the region would still have the
highest time to comply and it would have shown
very little reduction over the period of the study.

Looking at the distribution of the time to comply
for the economies in both 2004 and 2014 (see
Figure 2.10) 74% of economies now take less than
300 hours to comply with their tax obligations in
2014 compared to 60% in 2004. The number of
economies with a very high time to comply has
reduced, with the most common time to comply
being in the range of 151 – 200 hours which is
below the global mean average of 261 hours.

lack of improvement in the low income group

Looking at the distribution of the payments sub-
indicator across the economies (see Figure 2.13),
59% of economies had a payments sub-indicator of
30 or less in 2014, compared to 43% of economies
in 2004. In addition, we can see that in 2014
the distribution of the payments sub-indicator
has moved towards the lower end of the range
compared to 2004 and that the most common
value for the sub-indicator is in the range of 6 – 10
payments, compared to 31 – 35 payments in 2004.

Figure 2.14 shows the change in the average
payments sub-indicator by income group since
2004. From 2010, the low income economies have
had the highest average payments sub-indicator
and the region has also shown the least reform
over the period of the study. As with the time
to comply trends, this suggests that while there
is a need for further reforms in the low income
economies, challenges such as the need for
improvements in the availability and reliability of
internet connections and other communications
infrastructure may need to be addressed before
there can be signiğcant improvements in the
operation of the tax system.

57           Paying Taxes 2016. PwC commentary
Paying Taxes across the Middle East: a tale of divergent experiences.
Jeanine Daou, PwC Middle East Indirect Tax and Fiscal Reform Leader

Often any headline concerning taxes and the Middle East region is focussed around the
relatively low taxation levels. And for some economies in the Middle East, this is reĠected
in their Paying Taxes results. However this headline does not tell the whole story. While
paying tax is shown to be easy in the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and
Kuwait, in the rest of the economies in the region including Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and
Iran, the results show a very different picture with a variety of tax rates as well as quite a
range in the time required to fulğl the various compliance obligations.

Some economies across the region have been slow to adopt electronic ğling technologies
and self-assessment mechanisms, and it is also the case that post-ğling obligations can be
cumbersome, drawn out and time consuming.

The pace of change in those Middle East economies where paying taxes is currently
more burdensome, (including Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon) is slower and the Paying Taxes
sub-indicators have remained largely the same as in previous years, so that now where
reforms have been undertaken to improve tax systems by economies in other regions of
the world they are now outperforming these Middle East economies.

A ğnal issue to watch for the future for this region is that the oil exporting economies,
given continued lower oil prices, appear increasingly likely to introduce new taxes, such
as VAT, and this as a consequence will increase the necessary documentation and other
compliance requirements.

As governments across the Middle East consider tax reform there remains signiğcant
opportunity to enhance collection mechanisms, providing greater certainty and reduced
complexity for taxpayers through reform of administration practices.

                                                         four decades is quite remarkable.

they raise more than half of total revenue. These
are taxes which governments will need to rely on
in many countries for the foreseeable future. The
issue is to ensure they play their role in a balanced
tax system which supports a well-functioning
economy, supportive of growth and employment.

These labour taxes are particularly high in some
parts of Europe, and there is evidence – from
economic theory and from recent experience of
high unemployment in countries with large tax
wedges on labour income – that this has not been
good for employment. But there is no single lever
which can be pulled to address this problem. It
requires control of the overall levels of public
spending, a shift to other sources of tax revenue,
and changes to the structure of income taxes and
social security contributions so new employment
opportunities can develop – particularly in the
more Ġexible aspects of the labour market –
amongbpart-time workers and the self-employed.

The Ġow of employment income is a major
contributor to income and wealth generation in
most economies. So it is natural that it should be a
key part of the revenue-generating tax base. But we
need to get the balance right, so that labour income
is not taxed too heavily, other parts of the tax
system bear a reasonable share of revenue-raising,
and the structure of taxation reĠects the changing
structure of the economy and an increasingly
Ġexible labour market.

periods of time, policy interventions can have a

Improving both tax policy and tax administration
is central to any action plan intended to tackle
informality. While the formalisation process takes
place against a baseline that is conditioned by
many social, cultural, economic and historical
factors that are unrelated to taxation, reductions
in the ğnancial and administrative burdens of
taxation do appear to be associated with increases
in the level of compliance. Moreover, adopting
a taxpayer-centric approach to the shadow
economy can help policymakers to appreciate the
wealth of options that are available to promote
compliance. These options are not limited to
repressive measures intended to enhance detection
and enforcement. Rather, they include reforms
aimed at reducing the ğnancial and administrative
costs of formalisation, encouraging individuals
and businesses to operate on a formal basis from
the outset, enhancing the wider social, legal
and economic beneğts available to those who
do operate on a formal footing, and assisting
vulnerable individuals currently dependent on
undeclared employment to transition to the formal
sector. Taken in aggregate, these reforms have real
potential to improve taxpayer morale and drive
forward formalisation. Convergence with the low
rates of informality seen in some countries cannot
be achieved overnight, but there are many ways to
speed up the journey.

     African tax administrations: a Dutch multinationals perspective. In a recent study by the Dutch Association of Investors for
     Sustainable Development (VBDO, 2015), tax directors of the Dutch listed companies have identiĺed the following challenges to
     taxation in developing countries:
     • Opportunistic / aggressive behaviour of local tax authorities towards MNEs;
     • Overly hierarchical and bureaucratic tax organisation, dif ĺcult to get a single point of contact;
     • Time-consuming and costly appeal procedures;
     • Multi-interpretable, complex and fast-changing tax laws;
     • Corruption within governmental bodies;
     • Lack of capacity and skills of local tax authorities;
     • Different perspectives, dif ĺcult to establish an open and transparent relationship with local tax authorities.
     Businesses struggles to establish the right dialogue and good working relations with local tax authorities in many developing
     countries. However, MNEs are crucial for the ĺnancial development and economic sustainability of these countries with an
     estimated annual contribution of 750 billion dollars to local economies (UNCTAD, 2015). Paying Taxes refers to a medium sized
     enterprise, however we believe that the concepts outlined in this paper remain relevant.

‘How do I know as a tax administration that I

can be found if a taxpayer has an internal control
