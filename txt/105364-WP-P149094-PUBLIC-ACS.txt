Introduction

1.      Being an archipelago, the Philippines requires an efficient water transport system.
However, this is presently not the case. The domestic shipping industry is characterized by
high costs, low quality of service, and a poor safety record (Table 1). Logistics costs account for
24-53 percent of wholesale price, while shipping and port handling cost around 8 percent of
wholesale price and 5 percent of retail price.2 Philippine domestic shipping is generally more
expensive than in Malaysia or Indonesia—2 other archipelagos. Moreover, it is more expensive
to transport goods between 2 Philippine ports than between 2 Philippine ports via an
international port. In the East Asia region, the Philippines trails behind its neighbors in various
logistics performance and connectivity indices. For instance, in liner shipping connectivity, the
Philippines ranked 66th out of 157 countries in 2013, and performs the worst among a group of
East Asian comparators.3,4 Delays in shipment, slow cargo handling, and frequent accidents are
the top complaints of businesses. In the East Asia Region, the Philippines has the highest
absolute casualty rate, which is 40 percent higher than the second-ranked country, Indonesia.5
On average, there are 228 ships involved in accidents and 303 casualties per year in the
Philippines.

2.      Among the probable causes of the poor state of the domestic shipping industry is the
lack of competition from more efficient foreign shipping companies. More competition can
serve as a disciplining force or an incentive to be more efficient. However, the country ’s laws
restrict foreign shipping companies from serving domestic routes. This is known as cabotage.6

3.      Cognizant of these issues, the President has given priority to the reform of the
country’s cabotage provisions. In his July 2013 state-of-the-nation address, President Aquino
identified cabotage liberalization as a priority reform and asked congress to amend the
cabotage provisions. Aside from cabotage reform, the government is also looking to enhance
competition among domestic shipping firms and improve the efficiency of the ports system.

  These prices are averages based on a sample of goods. See Tables 6 and 7 for a list of references for these goods.
3
  The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It
is computed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) based on 5 components of
the maritime transport sector: number of ships, their container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number of
services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports.
4
  It can be argued that Philippine ships serving domestic routes are less efficient than Philippine ships serving
international routes, given the high rate of maritime accidents and complaints from businesses. In this case, the
liner shipping connectivity score for the Philippines provides an upper bound for the performance of domestic
ships.
5
  The Philippines also has the highest relative casualty rate, surpassing Myanmar. This is measured by the ratio of
total casualties to total fleet size.
6
  Cabotage traditionally refers to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, in the same country. Originally a
shipping term, cabotage now also covers aviation, railways, and road transport. Cabotage restrictions are often
defined as the exclusive right of a country to operate land, air, or sea traffic within its territory.

                                                                                                                  4
The objective of this package of reforms is to foster more competition in the shipping industry,
help reduce shipping costs, and improve the services and safety standards in the industry. The
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) was tasked to lead the reform efforts
and asked the World Bank Group for advice on how to carry out this reform package.

4.      This policy note is part of a series of policy notes on improving the efficiency of the
country’s maritime sector. Cabotage liberalization only addresses part of the overall challenge.
It can help lower shipping costs of export and import goods and domestic container cargo, but
is unlikely to lower the cost of transporting agricultural products, which are often carried in
bulk. Complementary and more fundamental reforms in domestic shipping and ports are also
needed to address these concerns. In this regard, 2 other notes were prepared together with
the cabotage note. One policy note looks at how domestic competition in the shipping industry
can be enhanced. The other note looks at how the efficiency of the ports system can be
enhanced especially when cabotage is liberalized. All 3 notes are to be presented to the Cabinet
Economic Cluster in the third quarter of 2014.

Philippine cabotage restrictions

5.      The legal basis for Philippine cabotage is found in the 1987 Constitution and several
related laws and jurisprudences. Article XII Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution restricts the
ownership and operation of public utilities to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations with
at least 60 percent Filipino equity. The term public utility is defined in the deliberations of the
Constitutional Commission and in jurisprudences (i.e., decisions of the Supreme Court).7 The

 See for instance Albano vs. Reyes (G.R. No. 83551, 11 July 1989) and Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Co. vs. Public
Utility Board (G.R. No. L-19857, 2 March 1923)

                                                                                                                                 5
main laws which govern cabotage are: i) the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act 146 of 1936
as amended by Republic Act [RA] 2677), ii) the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (RA
1937 of 1957), and iii) the Domestic Shipping Development Act (DSDA) (RA 9295 of 2004).

6.      Foreigners are only allowed to engage in domestic shipping activities under 2
conditions: i) through equity infusion of at most 40 percent in a Filipino shipping company, or ii)
via a special permit as provided by Section 6 of the DSDA.


Benefits of cabotage liberalization

7.      International evidence suggests that opening up the domestic shipping industry to
international competition can improve efficiency. The experience of other countries points to
a number of benefits from cabotage liberalization. For example, in New Zealand, freight rates
declined between 25 and 50 percent following cabotage liberalization in 1995. Yet, the benefits
can materialize even without actual entry of foreign shipping companies into the market. This is
because the mere threat of competition from more efficient foreign shipping companies can
serve as a disciplining force or an incentive to be more efficient, thereby lowering shipping
costs. For certain types and quantities of cargo (mostly containerized cargo), the use of larger
and more advanced foreign-flagged vessels can reduce costs by taking advantage of economies
of scale and cargo optimization. For instance, allowing the shipment of domestic cargo in the
domestic leg of an international vessel with spare capacity due to imbalanced trade could be
cheaper than shipping them on smaller domestic ships that lack scale and transferring them to
an international ship. Similarly, export and import cargo can benefit from economies of scale by
avoiding unnecessary cargo transfers from a domestic vessel to an international vessel. Finally,
with complementary reforms in the ports and roads sector, shipping costs can be reduced
further.

8.       Cabotage liberalization can help improve service and safety standards. Adherence to
international safety standards and good practices, introduction of improved technology, and a
reduction in the acquisition costs of new and safer vessels can come with cabotage
liberalization. These can help the domestic maritime industry raise its service and safety
standards, resulting in more efficient travel and freight delivery, and fewer maritime accidents.

9.       Economy-wide, cabotage liberalization can help raise real income, create more and
better jobs, and reduce poverty. The entry of global technology and expertise alongside
cabotage liberalization can help the Philippines become more integrated into the international
and regional shipping industry. In addition, it can further strengthen its comparative advantage
as a world-class provider of maritime manpower, as the Philippines already accounts for 25
percent of global seafarers. Potential reduction in prices brought about by cabotage
liberalization can open up new market opportunities and create new jobs. With improved
service and safety standards, more goods will arrive on time and the risk of maritime accidents



                                                                                                 6
will be lowered, thereby reducing business volatility and the need for costly insurance. In turn,
this can further contribute to lowering consumer prices and increasing business profitability.
Finally, cabotage reform can help the country develop its exports sector and create jobs in
manufacturing, while helping the Philippines prepare for more intense competition in a future
open ASEAN market.


Forms of cabotage liberalization

10.     Cabotage restrictions can be liberalized by increasing the scope of exemptions or
making the nationality criteria more inclusive. Exemptions can cover the following: i) the non-
availability of a suitable ship (e.g., a large enough ship to address scale), ii) ancillary cargo (i.e.,
export or import cargo), iii) adjunct cargo (i.e., domestic cargo on the domestic leg of an
international vessel with spare capacity), and iv) specific high impact activities such as routes
between major ports, major import and export products, and ships that are large enough to
provide scale. Options to make the nationality criteria more inclusive include: i) gradually
increasing the allowable share of foreign equity from the current 40 to 100 percent, ii) allowing
foreign management of shipping companies, iii) facilitating the entry of leased vessels and other
forms of vessel importation, iv) allowing dry docking (i.e., repair and maintenance of ships)
outside the country, v) allowing foreign crew members when no Filipinos qualify, and vi) easing
the process of acquiring time and bareboat charters.8


Reform options

11.    Liberalizing cabotage restrictions can be implemented either swiftly and radically, or
gradually. Typically, a swift and radical approach implements the various components of a
reform simultaneously, while rallying key supporters who will make implementation easier.
While this approach requires considerable political support, the main premise is that speedier
and more comprehensive reforms would yield larger immediate returns, making the reform
package quickly irreversible.

12.     On the other hand, a gradual approach would implement the reforms over a longer
period of time. This approach would work best when vested interests are strong within the
status quo and uncertainties surround the outcome, thereby putting a premium on lessons
learned from the implementation of earlier components of the reforms. The country’s past
reform experiences have mostly followed a gradual approach (e.g., banking, aviation, and retail
trade). A gradual approach may be less contentious and thus more politically feasible. It has
several other advantages. It can give affected parties ample time to adjust, provide

 Time charter refers to leasing a vessel with its own crew. Bareboat charter refers to leasing only the vessel. The
Philippines allows time charters up to a maximum of 1 year while bareboat charter is allowed for a minimum of 1
year.


                                                                                                                 7
policymakers room to learn from earlier phases and improve the next phases of liberalization,
generate early results to convince skeptics of the benefit of the reform, and build momentum
and support for the more difficult reform—constitutional change. However, a more gradual
approach could also provide opportunities to delay and postpone the reforms.

13.      A swift and radical approach goes directly to amending the 1987 Constitution. Being
the fundamental source of cabotage, an amendment to the constitution would remove the
fundamental barrier to cabotage liberalization, making the reform swifter and more decisive.
This reform entails removing the foreign ownership restriction on shipping, and all other public
utilities, and relegating the decision to impose restrictions to Congress or the President via the
bi-annual Foreign Investment Negative List. By lifting restrictions on all public utilities, cost
reduction for the entire logistics chain can be better realized than if only shipping were to be
liberalized.

14.      Following a constitutional amendment, a new shipping law could be enacted to
gradually liberalize cabotage restrictions over a specified period of time. The new legislation
could: i) gradually increase the allowable foreign equity share from 40 to 100 percent, ii) allow
foreign vessels to carry ancillary and adjunct cargo between two domestic ports, and iii) expand
the list of exemptions over time to explicitly include specific activities that have high economic
value. However, the phasing in of reforms should be time-bound, so as to avoid uncertainty and
distortions arising from lengthy processes.

15.      Alternatively, a more gradual approach could be adopted, beginning with steps that
only require executive action, such as simplifying procedures, granting more special permits,
and promoting time and bareboat charters (see Table 2 for a summary). Special permits could
be given more frequently to ancillary and adjunct cargo, and high impact routes as these can
help lower shipping cost and improve efficiency—2 reasons that can justify the public interest
criterion for the grant of special permits. Time and bareboat charters could be promoted to
facilitate the access of domestic firms to better ships and more innovative maritime
technologies and practices from abroad. Chartering lowers the upfront investment costs for
deploying better and more efficient ships, particularly those that comply with international
safety standards.

16.    Moreover, to facilitate partnering between domestic and foreign operators without
requiring constitutional change, the government could facilitate the licensing of combined
"international-domestic" routes (e.g., Hong Kong-Manila-Cebu) for domestic shipping lines.
Currently, the licensing of such routes requires special permits for each conversion from a local
to an overseas route and vice versa. Such reforms would enable local shipping companies to
partner with foreign companies, giving them access to better prices for the purchase or lease of
new ships, a larger market, and state-of-the-art shipping management and information
systems. Because of stricter enforcement of safety standards on international routes, this
would result in an upgraded domestic fleet and consequently fewer maritime accidents. Most
importantly, it would allow operators to maximize the cargo load of ships with an optimum mix
of domestic and export cargo.

                                                                                                8
17.     Gradual liberalization should be accompanied by measures to level the playing field
between foreign and domestic firms. Concerns about the vulnerability of domestic firms to
foreign competition can be addressed by a number of complementary measures. These include
i) removing the requirements for domestic ships to dry dock and refuel exclusively in the
Philippines, thereby reducing operational cost, and ii) introducing tax measures that would
treat domestic and foreign shipping companies on equal footing. Since international vessels are
not subject to income tax like domestic firms are, a tonnage tax could be introduced. The
tonnage tax would be charged only on income from the particular shipping operation, but not
on all operations of the shipping company. It would allow for more equal competition, as the
difference in the cost of conducting operations between domestic and international sectors of
the industry would be reduced.

18.    Reforms which require legislation and constitutional change can then follow in the
medium-term. These could include amending the Domestic Shipping Development Act (DSDA)
to define aspects of shipping that can be considered as a non-public utility, followed by
amending the Constitution and enacting a new shipping law that would gradually phase out
cabotage.

                                              Introduction


19.     The purpose of this policy note is to present reform options on cabotage liberalization.
The goal of cabotage liberalization is to help i) foster more competition in the domestic
shipping industry, ii) reduce shipping cost, and iii) improve efficiency, maritime services, and
safety standards. These, together with complementary reforms in domestic shipping and ports,
can help enhance consumer and producer welfare through lower consumer prices, higher
household real income, timely delivery of goods, and ultimately, job creation and poverty
reduction through greater market access.

20.    Cognizant of the problems besetting the Philippine maritime sector, the President has
given priority to the reform of the cabotage provisions. In his July 2013 State of the Nation
Address, President Aquino identified cabotage liberalization as a priority reform and asked
congress to amend the cabotage provisions “in order to foster greater competition and to lower
the cost of transportation for agricultural sector and other industries.” 9

21.    The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) has been tasked to lead
the reform. Aside from lifting cabotage restrictions, NEDA is also looking to enhance
competition among domestic shipping firms and improve the efficiency of the ports system.
The Secretary of NEDA has turned to the World Bank for advice on how to carry out this reform
package.

22.     This policy note is part of a series of studies on improving the efficiency of the
country’s maritime sector. Cabotage liberalization only addresses part of the overall challenge.
While it can help lower shipping costs of export and import goods and domestic container
cargo, it is unlikely to lower the cost of transporting agricultural products, which are often
carried in bulk. Complementary and more fundamental reforms in domestic shipping and ports
are also needed to address these concerns. In this regard, 2 other notes were prepared
together with the cabotage note. One policy note looks at how domestic competition in the
shipping industry can be enhanced. The other note looks at how the efficiency of the ports
system can be enhanced especially when cabotage is liberalized. All 3 notes are to be presented
to the Cabinet Economic Cluster in the third quarter of 2014.

23.    This policy note on cabotage is organized as follows. Part I provides an overview of the
domestic shipping industry and discusses the key issues that it faces. Part II discusses the
underlying reasons for the industry’s inefficiency. Part III discusses the concept of cabotage, the

  The technical report of the 2013 State of the Nation Address explains that amendments to the cabotage
provisions are needed to “remove from local shipping operators the exclusive privilege of conducting coastwise
trade and allow foreign shippers to engage in the same, thereby enabling the country to benefit from lower prices
and greater efficiency brought about by open competition. The proposed legislation will also include provisions
rationalizing sea transport costs.”


                                                                                                              11

selected countries. Part IV closes with a discussion of reform options.

Significance of the industry

24.    The Philippine ports and shipping sectors account for a very small share of GDP and
employment. Between 2008 and 2013, the 2 sectors account for only 0.2 percent of gross
value-added. Average growth was slower at 3.9 percent compared to the economy-wide
growth of 4.8 percent (Table 3). In 2010, employment in these sectors was estimated at around
54,000 (57,000 in 2013), of which around 18,000 were formally employed (Table 4).10

25.     Yet, the efficiency of ports and shipping operations has a significant impact on prices
and jobs, given the archipelagic geography of the country. For instance, around 15 million
agriculture workers in the Philippines depend on these 2 industries to connect to markets and
sell their produce. In the Visayas, 18 million people rely on shipping to access the majority of
their goods, including food. In Mindanao, 22 million people rely on shipping for most
manufactured goods given its weak manufacturing sector. Its farmers also rely on shipping to
bring their produce to Manila and to the rest of the world.

26.    Currently, the domestic maritime industry is beset with a number of inefficiencies.
These include the high cost of shipping, the low quality of service, and a poor safety record that
manifests in frequent maritime accidents. These issues strongly suggest that the liberalization
of the industry, which started in 1989, has yet to result in more efficiency and greater
innovation. Box 1 discusses the liberalization of the domestic shipping industry.


                        Box 1. Liberalization of the domestic shipping industry

Pre-reform regulatory framework

Regulation of the domestic shipping industry was first introduced during the American
colonial period and was patterned after the US Jones Act and the Passenger Vessels Services
Act. This sought to balance 2 objectives: protect the public from exorbitant tariffs and prevent
“ruinous” competition among shipping operators. The Board of Transportation (BOT) was
initially charged with regulating the industry, which covers route entry and tariff determination,
until the creation of the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) in 1985.11

Between 1928 and 1985, the basic structure of tariffs remained largely unchanged. 12 Tariffs
were adjusted periodically and across-the-board for inflation. Upward adjustments were also
made using the revenue deficiency method, which determined the tariff needed to provide a
rate of return13 (ROI) consistent with the Public Service Act of 1936 (Commonwealth Act No.
146).

The shipping industry was initially exempted from a government regulation requiring
operators of all public services to obtain a certificate of public convenience (CPC). 14 Route

11
    MARINA was created under Presidential Decree No. 474 and mandated to provide effective supervision,
regulation, and rationalization of the organizational management, ownership, and operations of all water transport
utilities and other maritime enterprises.
12
   See Renardet Sauti Consulting Engineers (1986) for a more detailed discussion.
13
   The maximum allowable ROI for public utilities has always been 12 percent.
14
   The Public Service Act stipulates in Section 13 (a) that “the Public Service Commission shall have no authority to
require steamboats, motor ships and steamship lines, whether privately-owned, or owned or operated by any
Government controlled corporation or instrumentality, to obtain certificate of public convenience or to prescribe
their definite routes or lines of service.”

                                                                                                                  13
licensing was introduced in 1972. It restricted competition to prevent “overtonnage” on major
routes and ensure the availability of service for the smaller and less lucrative routes.15


Liberalization

Beset with large-scale inefficiencies in the industry and frequent maritime accidents, the
government embarked on a gradual liberalization of the industry beginning in 1989. The
setting of both passenger and freight tariffs, as well as routes, was gradually and partially
liberalized.

The liberalization of tariffs began with the removal of ad valorem charges on passenger
tariffs. In 1990, the 30 percent valuation surcharge for insurance premiums was abolished and
freight tariffs for refrigerated cargoes, transit cargoes, and livestock were liberalized. In 1992,
freight tariffs for Class A and Class B cargoes were liberalized.16 Through Executive Order 213 of
1994, all freight tariffs were liberalized except for non-containerized basic commodities. Full
tariff liberalization was achieved in 1999 with the abolition of the Domestic Shipping
Consultative Councils (DOSCONs), allowing shipping operators to fully set their own tariffs.17

In 1992, route liberalization was introduced through Memorandum Circular Nos. 71 and 80,
which opened routes to at least 2 operators. Protection for developmental routes (i.e., low
volume routes) was limited to a maximum of 5 years after which the route was opened to other
operators.18 Executive Order 185 of 1994 further strengthened liberalization efforts by allowing
operators to charge market-accepted freight and passage rates different from the fork rates
(i.e., indicative or reference rates provided by MARINA) upon their provision of pioneering
technological innovation of shipping service in a developmental route.

    Class A cargo includes processed goods or high value manufactured goods. Class B cargo includes semi-
processed goods or low value manufactured goods.
17
    Prior to 1999, shipping operators were not allowed to determine their own tariffs. Instead, tariffs were
negotiated through the Domestic Shipping Consultative Councils (DOSCONs), which was composed of
shippers/consumers, operators, and government representatives.
18
    Before deregulation, protection was granted for an indefinite period (i.e., until the initial investment is
recovered).

High cost of shipping

27.     Domestic shipping costs per mile are high. On average, Philippine shipping cost is
significantly more expensive than Indonesia’s and slightly more expensive than Malaysia’s. The
average port-to-port cost per nautical mile in the Philippines is USD 1.47, higher than
Indonesia’s USD 0.77 and slightly higher than Malaysia’s USD 1.36 (Table 5).19

28.    Ironically, it is more expensive to transport goods between 2 domestic points than 2
domestic points via an international point. For example, transporting goods in a 40-foot
container from Manila to Cagayan de Oro costs some USD 1,860 but transporting between
Manila and Cagayan de Oro via Kaohsiung would reduce the tariff by USD 716 to only USD
1,144 (Table 6). Moreover, a comparison of shipping costs in selected domestic and
international routes indicates that domestic routes are more expensive than international
routes on a per mile basis. For instance, the shorter Manila-Davao route is more expensive than
the longer Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Port Klang to Manila routes (Table 7).

  These estimates are based on the average values of available data. One issue with these estimates is that they
do not compare the same products. A better approach would be to acquire the shipping costs of multinational
companies (such as Nestlé or Unilever) that are present in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, for the same
product. This could form part of future analysis.

29.     As a result, domestic shipping costs are a substantial part of logistics costs in the
Philippines. Logistics costs account for 24 to 53 percent of wholesale price in the Philippines
compared to less than 20 percent in other countries in the East Asia region. 20 Shipping and port
handling costs account for an average of 35 percent of logistics cost, 8 percent (to as high as 30
percent) of wholesale price depending on the goods and routes, and an average of 5 percent of
retail price (Tables 8 and 9).21

   Part of the high cost of logistics in the Philippines is driven by its archipelagic geography. However, Indonesia,
another archipelago, has lower unit shipping cost (Table 4). This indicates that geography alone does not fully
explain why the Philippines has high logistics cost.

30.     However, such comparisons should be treated with extreme caution. There are several
factors that may generate differences in tariff rates which should be taken into account:

        International shipping lines benefit from economies of scale as they tend to have larger
         container vessels carrying at least 800 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) compared to
         local cargo vessels with 150 – 200 TEU capacity and significantly less for passenger,
         break bulk, and container combination vessels.
        Vessels utilized in domestic shipping are geared vessels (i.e., with cranes), 22 which are
         more expensive to acquire and operate, given the limited supply of geared vessels. Most
         ports in the Philippines do not have specialized cargo handling equipment needed to
         service gearless container vessels. Container vessels on international routes are
         normally gearless (i.e., without cranes) since the ports they serve have complete cargo
         handling equipment.
        International liner shipping operates under a different regulatory and market
         environment and is not subject to the same rules as domestic shipping in the
         Philippines. Vessels are often registered under so-called “flags of convenience,” which
         bring certain cost advantages.
        The international feeder routes, which feed into mega-container vessels with capacities
         of 12,500 TEUs at hub ports. Feeder tariffs do not necessarily reflect the stand-alone
         costs of the feeder ship operation.
        Freight rates are strongly influenced by the direction of trade. If trade is significantly
         imbalanced, rates in the higher volume direction will be much higher than in the reverse
         direction.

22
  Geared vessels or vessels with onboard cranes are slowly being phased out as major international ports already
provide their own gantry cranes to load/unload containers. Refrigerated vessels or reefer vessels are specialized
vessels used in the transportation of cargo requiring refrigeration such as pineapples, mangoes, etc. With the
widespread use of refrigerated containers by international cargo liners and their increasing allocation of slots on
vessels for reefer containers, the need for reefer vessels has also diminished significantly.

                                                                                                                17
             Quoted freight rate may or may not include terminal handling charges at either end of
              the journey. These costs may comprise a significant percentage of total shipping cost
              (typically one-third, but can be more than 50 percent under some circumstances).

For these reasons, comparison between international and domestic freight rates cannot be
regarded as firm evidence that domestic freight rates reflect excessive costs, or that domestic
shipping operators are making excess profit.


Low quality of service

31.     Domestic shipping is characterized by low quality of service. In the East Asia region, the
Philippines trails behind its neighbors in various logistics performance and connectivity indices.
For instance, in liner shipping connectivity,23 the Philippines ranked 66th out of 157 countries in
2013, and performs the worst among a group of East Asian comparators.24 It is at the bottom in
terms of frequency with which shipments are delivered within expected time and is third to the
bottom in terms of arranging competitively priced shipments (Figure 1 and Table 10).
Moreover, the Philippines has shown minimal improvements in the last 10 years.

32.    Low quality of service is also pronounced in cargo handling. The lack of high quality
shore-based handling equipment is reflected in poor cargo handling productivity and delays in
many ports. Interviews with various stakeholders reveal that cargo handling performance,
especially in the loading and unloading of break bulk cargo, is poor. This results in significant

   The liner shipping connectivity index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It
is computed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) based on five components of
the maritime transport sector: number of ships, their container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number of
services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports.
24
   It can be argued that Philippine ships serving domestic routes are less efficient than Philippine ships serving
international routes, given the high rate of maritime accidents and complaints from businesses. In this case, the
liner shipping connectivity score for the Philippines provides an upper bound for the performance of domestic
ships.

Poor safety record and high frequency of maritime accidents

33.     The industry’s low quality of service and poor safety standards are most evident in the
high number of maritime accidents. A comparative analysis from the ASEAN-Japan Transport
Partnership database shows that in the East Asia Region, the Philippines has the highest
casualty rate. This is 40 percent higher than the second ranked country, Indonesia (Table 11).25
On average, there were 228 ships involved in accidents and 303 casualties per year in the
Philippines from 2004 to 2012. Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) data also show a similar trend.
From 1995 to 2006, there were 1,982 maritime accidents, or an average of 167 accidents per
year. Casualties (both in terms of lives lost and missing people) numbered 2,482, or an average
of 207 per year (Figure 2). Of the cases documented by the PCG, around 80 percent had the
potential to compromise safety of cargo, and more importantly, of the passengers and crew.
The most frequent type of maritime accident was capsizing (30 percent), followed by ship
grounding (18 percent), and sinking (17 percent) (Figure 3). Box 2 discusses some of the
country’s major maritime accidents.

                                  Box 2. Worst maritime accidents in the world

The Philippines is home to some of the worst peace-time maritime accidents in the world. In
December 1987, MV Doña Paz, a passenger ferry owned by Sulpicio Lines with a capacity of
1,518 passengers, collided with MT Vector, a small tanker carrying 8,800 barrels of gasoline.
The collision sparked a massive fire and resulted in the death of around 4,000 people, a clear
indication that MV Doña Paz was severely overloaded. Only 26 survivors were reported.
Preliminary investigations showed that the incident was a result of negligence and inability to
follow proper safety regulations.26 Despite ongoing investigation, Sulpicio Lines was allowed to
continue operating.27

In June 2008, MV Princess of the Stars, also owned by Sulpicio Lines, sailed during a strong
typhoon. Strong winds pushed it against the rocks. The ship capsized and resulted in over 1,000
casualties. Despite poor weather conditions, the ship’s captain took the risk of continuing the
trip, resulting in the country’s worst maritime accident in 20 years. The Board of Maritime
Inquiry concluded that human error led to the accident.

In August 2013, MV St. Thomas Aquinas, a passenger ferry owned by 2GO Shipping Lines, and
Sulpicio Express Siete, a cargo ship owned by Philippine Span Asia Carrier (formerly Sulpicio
Lines), collided in fair weather just 2 kilometers from the shore of Talisay City in Cebu

26
    An investigation by the Board of Marine Inquiry claimed that both owners and operators showed gross
negligence and complete lack of care. The board found that the Vector Shipping Corporation did not possess a
license to operate the vessel and that the crew of MT Vector was not qualified to run the tanker.
27
   In the absence of a final ruling, shipping companies can insist that they be allowed to continue operation.

                                                                                                                                  20
Province. Over 116 lives were lost. As in the past, human error was determined to be the cause
of the accident. According to preliminary investigations of the Board of Maritime Inquiry, the
accident occurred because of a failure of the 2 ships to communicate. Sulpicio Express Siete, the
outgoing vessel from Cebu, used the inbound lane leading to the collision with the inbound MV
St. Thomas Aquinas.28 The captains of both ships claimed that they tried to contact each other
by radio in order to avoid crossing each other’s path , but without success. Both the ferry and
cargo ship also reportedly failed to comply with labor standards and safety regulations. 29 One of
the safety regulations violated by both ships was the lack of the required safety committee
members or safety officers to ensure the health and safety of the passengers and crew.

                  Underlying reasons for the industry’s inefficiency
34.     High shipping cost, low quality of service, and poor safety standards are caused by a
number of factors. In shipping, the oligopolistic market structure and low profitability leading
to lack of investments in new ships are the main reasons for the industry’s inefficiencies. Other
sources of inefficiencies are the lack of market scale, which is exacerbated by the lack of
connectivity, network planning, and consolidation, weak port infrastructure, and conflict of
interest in the Philippine Ports Authority.


Oligopolistic market structure

35.    There are many companies offering commercial shipping services in the Philippines, 30
but scheduled operations (i.e., liners) are dominated by a few firms.31 The bulk of sea freight
28
   This suggests that, apart from human error, standard operating procedures and safety protocols were also
violated. The investigation revealed that it was common practice for outbound ships to take the inbound lane to
avoid shallow waters.
29
   This finding is based on the Department of Labor and Employment’s initial investigation. The extent of non -
compliance has not been finalized.
30
   Between 1996 and 2008, there was an average of 37 shipping firms in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(SEC) list of top 5,000 corporations. According to MARINA, there were 2,802 shipping operators in 2012, of which
555 are partnerships/corporations.
31
   The small number of dominant players in scheduled operations is the result of several mergers. For instance, in
2010, Negros Navigation acquired Aboitiz Transport System Corporation (ATSC) and all its subsidiaries to form 2GO
Group. This new company also acquired several other major players such as Supercat Fast Ferry, Philippine Fast
Ferry Corporation, and Cebu Ferries Corporation. Philippine Fast Ferry, in turn, is the result of the merger between

                                                                                                                 21
is provided by tramp services. Tramp operators provide an alternative to scheduled operations,
mostly for bulk or break bulk cargo on a contract basis. Their ports of call cover those that are
not served by liners. Their rates are not reported to MARINA. While required to have a
certificate of public convenience (CPC) as a tramp operator, their operations are seldom
monitored and no statistics are available on the volume of cargo carried.

36.    Scheduled operations are dominated by a few companies. In 2011, the three biggest
shipping companies, 2GO Group, Philippine Span Asia Container (formerly Sulpicio Lines), and
Solid Shipping, accounted for some 38 percent of the freight market.32 The next 2 largest
companies, NMC Container Lines and Asian Shipping, accounted for around 7 percent of the
market. Many of these liners are long time players.

37.    Most routes are served by 1 or 2 shipping companies. Of around 54 primary routes,
over 40 percent are served by a single operator. A third of the routes are served by two
operators. Less than one quarter of routes are served by three or more operators (Figure 4). In
general, high volume routes which are financially more attractive (e.g. Manila-Cebu, Cebu-
Cagayan de Oro, and Manila-Davao) attract many players - as many as 5 - while de facto
monopolies exist on routes with low demand (e.g., Bacolod City – General Santos City, Iloilo to
Davao, and Cebu City – Zamboanga) (Figure 5).

                          Figure 4. Most routes have only 1 or 2 operators.

Universal Aboitiz and Sea Angels Ferry Corporation (a subsidiary of Negros Navigation) in 1998. Cebu Ferries was
established in 1996 as a subsidiary of WG&A. ATSC emerged from Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the holding company of
Aboitiz Shipping Corporation, and WGA. The latter was formed in 1995 when William Lines, Gothong Lines, and
Aboitiz Shipping Corporation merged. Magsaysay Lines was formed when Lorenzo Shipping Lines and NMC
Container Lines merged.

   Market share is computed as the share of the top 5 firms’ revenues to the total revenues of shipping compan ies
included in the SEC list of top 5,000 firms. Shipping companies are identified with PSIC codes 61102, 61103, and
61104 for ocean freight transport, inter-island water passenger transport, and inter-island water freight transport,
respectively. This includes RORO and tramp.

38.    Significant barriers to market entry exist. Current regulations favor incumbents and
make it hard for new firms to enter the industry. Incumbents are allowed by law to object to
the granting of a CPC, which authorizes the operation of a ship to new entrants. Cumbersome
and costly procedures and the lack of transparency surrounding the CPC process also deter
entry of new firms. In response to these inefficiencies, MARINA has begun to simplify
procedures in early 2014 by streamlining the steps needed to register a ship.

39.    Several other regulations also contribute to the inefficient operation of the industry.
Currently, CPCs do not give priority to quality standards, which manifests in frequent maritime
accidents. Each new ship and/or new route requires shipping companies to apply for a new
CPC, which can be opposed by incumbents. The high cost of shipping is exacerbated by the
requirement to dry dock in the Philippines,33 which is generally more expensive (e.g., Chinese
dry docks are reportedly up to 3.5 times cheaper than Philippine dry docks), and high tax rates
associated with leasing vessels.

  Presidential Decree 1221 requires locally flagged ships, even those engaged in international trade, to dry dock in
the Philippines, unless they get a permit to do so otherwise.

                                                                                                                  23
Increased competition yet low profitability

40.    There are indications of increased competition in the domestic shipping industry over
the last 15 years following liberalization. The share of revenues of the top 5 shipping
companies fell from 69 percent in 1996 to around 45 percent in 2011 (Table 12). The reduction
in market share was most evident in the 2 biggest companies, 2GO Group and Sulpicio Lines,
while the 2 smallest players in the top 5 saw their market shares more than double.

41.     However, profitability in the shipping industry remains very low. The often claimed
assertion that shipping companies earn monopoly profits is not supported by available data.
Financial statements of shipping companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
reveal that shipping firms in the SEC Top 5,000 List of Corporations have very low return on
assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and profit margins (PM). The average ROA, ROE, and PM
between 1996 and 2008 were 0.6, 1, and 0.7 percent, respectively (Table 13).34 These ratios
were slightly higher at 2.6, 5.3, and 3.2 percent, respectively, between 2005 and 2008 when
shipping rates were liberalized compared to the pre-rate liberalization period, suggesting that
competitive pressures have contributed somewhat to improved efficiency, though still below
international benchmarks. A breakdown of these ratios by firm size reveals that the top 2 firms
were less profitable than the other firms.

Notes: Domestic shipping rates were deregulated in 2004. Data after 2008 is not available in usable format.


42.      Low profitability reflects competition from unscheduled and opportunistically
operating trampers, and from air and land transport. Trampers typically compete on flexibility
and price, with some of them operating sub-standard ships. Another major source of
competition comes from alternative modes of transportation, such as the roll-on roll-off
(RORO) services and air transport. Improved arterial roads and strong support for RORO
services since 2003 are making bus transport increasingly popular. Air transport liberalization
since 1993 has brought down average air fares by more than 50 percent in real terms, resulting
in a five-fold increase in domestic air passengers (see World Bank 2013 for more discussion).
Finally, the high incidence of maritime accidents has also drawn passengers away from liners.

43.     High input costs also pull down profitability. The overall cost structure of the Philippine
domestic shipping industry is broadly similar to that of shipping companies in the East Asia
region. Between 2008 and 2012, operating expenditures35 of Philippine domestic shipping
companies averaged around 70 percent of total revenues compared to an average of 80
percent among a group of comparators (Table 14). However, Philippine shipping firms pay more
for fuel and repairs compared to firms in other countries. Fuel is the largest cost item at 27
percent of total revenues, and at 41 percent of total operating expenditures (Tables 14 and 15).
In contrast, comparator companies, such as Maersk Group, OOCL Hong Kong, and NOL
35
  Operating expenditures exclude general and administrative expenses, finance costs, interest expense, and other
non-operating expenses.

                                                                                                                25
Singapore, registered lower share of fuel cost at around 20 percent of revenues.36 Industry
insiders explain that Philippine fuel is more expensive since it is not subsidized and a 12 percent
VAT is imposed on top of excise tax and import tariff, while fuel in Singapore, Malaysia, and
Indonesia are subsidized and are levied lower tax rates.

44.     Dry docking, repair, and maintenance are also major expenditure items, accounting
for an average of 11 percent of total operating cost (Table 15). Firm level data, however, show
that dry docking, repairs, and maintenance can reach as high as 26 percent of revenues. In
contrast, the average dry docking cost in the region was 50 percent cheaper and up to 3.5 times
cheaper in the case of China (IFC 2013a). The high share of dry docking, repair, and
maintenance to total cost reflects government regulations that mandate domestic ships to dry
dock in the Philippines.37 This has resulted in higher repair and maintenance cost and slower
repair time.




36
   MISC Berhad of Malaysia (whose cost breakdown was not available) can also be assumed to have access to
cheaper fuel as it is a subsidiary of Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil company.

   The market is typically dominated by a single shipyard for certain types of ships.

Lack of investment in ships

45.    Low profitability has resulted in low rates of investment. The domestic shipping
industry lags behind its ASEAN counterparts in new ship acquisition. The average age of the
country’s domestic passenger, general cargo, and container ships is around 30 years old ,
                                                                                                                                   27
compared to 8 years old among top Asian shipping companies (Table 16).38 Aging ships are one
reason for the high incidence of maritime accidents in the Philippines. They also contribute to
the high cost structure and inefficiencies in operation. The overall result of this vicious cycle is
the stagnation of the industry, which adversely impacts the economy through high logistics
costs, high food prices, and weak job creation.

Lack of market scale

46.     One of the key reasons for high shipping costs is small trade volumes that do not
justify big ships that can benefit from economies of scale.39 Economies of scale in shipping are
derived not from operating cost, as the difference in operating cost between a small vessel and
a large vessel is not substantial, but on the carrying capacity of the vessel. In the international
picture, the Philippines is a feeder destination, not a hub or main destination. According to
industry insiders, feeder vessels are generally a fourth of the size of mother ships that serve
hubs, and feeder ships add around USD 200 in additional unit freight cost.40

39
   The analysis of lack of scale leading to high shipping cost needs to be tempered by the possibility that these 2
variables are endogenous. Shipping cost can be high due to lack of scale, but lack of scale can also be caused by
high shipping cost. For instance, businessmen and farmers may decide against expanding their businesses/planting
more because of the high cost of shipping. A reduction in shipping cost can therefore induce an increase in scale.
40
   See Philippine Inter-Island Shipping Association (2013) for a more detailed discussion. According to industry
insiders, the size of feeder vessels is typically around 2,000 to 3,000 TEUs while mother ships are typically around
6,000 to 18,000 TEUs.

                                                                                                                 28
47.    Within the Philippines, domestic cargo trade is also relatively small. In 2011, domestic
cargo throughput in the Philippines amounted to 102 million metric tons or equivalent to 35
percent of Indonesia’s 291 million metric tons.41 Ironically, compared to Vietnam, a non-
archipelagic country, Philippine throughput is only slightly higher than Vietnam’s 80 million
metric tons (Table 17).

48.     Philippine commodity flow data reveal that most of domestic sea trade is
concentrated in just a few shipping routes. Routes servicing the Port of Manila, the largest port
in the Philippines, account for around 47 percent of total Philippine domestic sea trade. Eight
other routes, out of a total of 137 routes, account for another 10 percent of total domestic sea
trade.

49.     The majority of domestic shipping routes have very small volumes. Table 18, which
shows commodity flows between major ports, reveals that majority of routes account for less
than 1 percent of total domestic sea trade.42 Small volumes do not warrant a further increase in
capacity or size of ships. An analysis of the Register of Ships maintained by MARINA shows that
a large number of ships are very small craft, many of them wooden-hulled, that operate very
localized service. Some 1,582 vessels or roughly 42 percent of total vessels have sizes that are
less than 50 gross register tonnage (GRT). For passenger and passenger/cargo vessels, this
proportion is much higher at over 80 percent (1,556 out of a total of 1,943 vessels). This in turn
adds to high cost of shipping.

50.     Moreover, many routes have predominantly one-direction traffic. For example, ships
plying the Manila to Cebu route are often filled to capacity, but the reverse route is filled way
below capacity. In terms of price, the Manila-Cebu leg amounts to around PHP 36,000 per 20-
foot container from pier to pier but the Cebu-Manila route amounts to only PHP 14,000,
reflecting weak demand. Moreover, most domestic shippers do not consolidate cargo,
contributing to unfilled capacity.

41
   Indonesia’s large domestic trade volume is partly attributed to its much larger economy and the presence of
natural resource commodities.
42
   Commodity flow data from the National Statistics Office are given only at the regional level. Commodity flows
between ports are not available. To arrive at port level data, the largest port (or 2 largest ports) per region is given
the entire region’s value.

                                                                                                                     29
51.    This lack of market scale is ultimately traced to the country’s weak agriculture and
manufacturing sectors, which are unable to produce more goods at low prices. Moreover,
variances in the quality of agricultural produce such as corn mean that farmers and
agribusinesses prefer to ship in sacks rather than co-mingle them in bulk, thereby increasing the
per unit cost of packaging and shipping.

Exacerbated by the lack of connectivity, network planning, and consolidation

52.     The lack of market scale is exacerbated by the lack of connectivity, network planning,
and consolidation. In general, national and regional transport planning is weak, resulting in
significant infrastructure gaps, such as missing regional arterial roads and farm to market roads
to connect farms to ports and ultimately to markets. These infrastructure gaps have, in turn,
contributed to the proliferation of public and private ports that spread the market too thinly
and therefore reduce scale. For example, Northern Mindanao from Ozamis to Surigao, with a
total coastline of around 497 kilometers, has 7 public ports: Cagayan de Oro (CDO), Mindanao
Container Terminal (MCT), Iligan, Nasipit in Butuan, Surigao, Bislig, and Ozamis, alongside 29
private ports. Consolidating commercial traffic in the largest port in Cagayan de Oro (MCT) can
help increase scale and reduce cost, while allowing private ports to deal with private cargo.




Lack of port and road infrastructure

53.     Port infrastructure deficiencies also contribute to the high cost of shipping. According
to the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-14, the Philippines ranks 98th out of 148 countries
in the quality of overall infrastructure. Road infrastructure is ranked higher at 87th, but it still
trails behind its neighbors. In terms of port infrastructure, it ranks 116th and, ironically, was
better only compared to Lao PDR (which is a landlocked country) (Table 19). The consequences

                                                                                                                                                   30
of these infrastructure deficiencies are severe congestion, long wait time for ships, delays in
shipment, and consequently, higher cost of shipping.

54.     The majority of the country’s major domestic ports are not equipped with modern
port facilities to handle today’s larger and more advanced vessels. In many of the country’s
ports, cargo handlers cannot deploy modern cargo handling equipment such as quay cranes
and other heavy equipment due to the poor condition of ports and weight limitations. In these
ports, vessels must rely on on-board cranes. As a result, the shipping industry is constrained to
use geared vessels (i.e., vessels with on-board cranes) to handle port cargo. These vessels are
more costly to construct and are increasingly short in supply, and consequently more expensive
to buy or charter, leading to higher cost of operations and inefficiencies in both port and
shipping operations (IFC 2013b).

55.     Maritime access is limited by shallow berths in most Philippine ports. An important
factor determining access of ships to ports is the berth depth of both the origin and destination
ports. In the Philippines, 60 percent of berths at major public ports have depths that are less


                                                                                                31
than 8 meters.43 This means that mid-sized vessels would have to wait for high tide before they
can dock while large vessels cannot be accommodated even if demand increases. The resulting
reliance on smaller vessels means that shipping companies cannot take advantage of
economies of scale to reduce shipping cost even if the market expands.

56.     Apart from port infrastructure, the country’s weak state of road infrastructure also
contributes to high logistics costs. The World Development Indicator (WDI) database shows
that the Philippines has only about 40,000 kilometers of paved roads out of 200,036 kilometers
in 2003 (20 percent paved),44 compared to an average of 198,184 kilometers of paved roads
(out of 455,702 kilometers or 43 percent paved) among East Asian countries. More importantly,
the country lacks adequate farm-to-market roads, which are important conduits to connect
farmers to markets. For instance, farmers in Benguet Province face up to 8 hours when bringing
their vegetables to Manila (a distance of about 280 kms or 40 km/h), when a more efficient
road network can bring this down to at most 4 hours. Inadequate road infrastructure also
results in congestion and limits the efficiency of shipping services. For instance, congestion
around the Port of Manila decreases truck turnaround time and the amount of
cargo/containers that can be carried in a day, and thus adversely impacts the efficiency of
shipping services in the country. Port congestion, in turn, results in significant road congestion.
Overall, JICA (2013) estimates the total annual cost of congestion at around PHP 876 billion
(around 8 percent of GDP) or PHP 2.4 billion daily.


Conflict of interest in the Philippine Ports Authority

57.     Finally, conflict of interest in the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) also contributes to
higher cost of shipping. The PPA is both a regulator and an operator of ports. It sets cargo
handling rates for all its ports but also receives at least 10 percent of all cargo handling fees.45
This not only raises the cost of shipping, but also gives rise to real or perceived conflict of
interest. This conflict of interest could be removed by shifting away from its port operations
mandate so that it can focus exclusively on its regulatory mandate.




                                       Cabotage liberalization

58.    Cabotage restrictions refer to policies that reserve the carriage of domestic cargo and
passengers to citizens. Cabotage liberalization refers to opening up the domestic shipping
industry to non-citizens. Cabotage liberalization can result in more innovation, improved
services, and lower prices. Allowing more efficient foreign shipping firms to operate in domestic
routes has the potential of lowering cargo rates and improving the quality of transport services.

43
   See JICA-MARINA (2005) for more discussion.
44
   This is based on latest available data from the World Development Indicators.
45
   This is prescribed by Letter of Instruction 1005-A signed by President Marcos in 1980.

                                                                                                 32
More competition from foreign shipping firms can also serve as a disciplining force or an
incentive for domestic shipping firms to be more efficient.

59.      Bringing down shipping costs and raising the quality of service and safety standards
require a comprehensive reform to address all the factors discussed above. Cabotage
liberalization is only one means of addressing these issues. It can help lower shipping costs of
export and import goods and domestic container cargo, but it is unlikely to lower the cost of
transporting agricultural products, which are often carried in bulk. Complementary and more
fundamental reforms in domestic shipping and ports are also needed to address these
concerns. This part of the note discusses cabotage liberalization while Annex 1 summarizes
related recommendations in domestic shipping, ports, and road infrastructure.


Cabotage regime in the Philippines

60.     The legal basis for Philippine cabotage is found in the 1987 Constitution and in several
legislations and jurisprudences. Article XII Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution restricts the
ownership and operation of public utilities to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations with
at least 60 percent Filipino equity. The term “public utility” is defined in the deliberations of the
Constitutional Commission,46 which can be used in legal proceedings, and in a number of
jurisprudences (i.e., decisions of the Supreme Court, which have the same effect of a statute).47
A number of legislations govern cabotage: these include i) the Public Service Act48
(Commonwealth Act 146 of 1936 as amended by Republic Act [RA] 2677), ii) the Tariff and
Customs Code of the Philippines (RA 1937 of 1957), and iii) the Domestic Shipping Development
Act (RA 9295 of 2004). Annex 2 provides the text of the relevant sections of these laws and
jurisprudences.

61.     The Public Service Act (PSA) is the earliest of the cabotage provisions. Enacted in 1936,
it defines “public service” to include the sea transport of passenger and freight, as well as ship
repair and the operation of wharfs and docks (i.e., port operation). The PSA also restricts the
issuance of a certificate of public convenience, which authorizes the operation of a ship, to only
citizens of the Philippines or to corporations with at least 60 percent Filipino equity. The original
purpose of this protectionist policy was to facilitate the development of the local shipping
industry. It was also argued that domestic operators were more familiar with maritime,
geographic, and weather conditions in the Philippines, and thus could provide safer sea travel.

62.     The Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (TCCP) reiterates the nationality
restriction as applied to the shipping industry. Section 902 of the TCCP states that “the right to
engage in the Philippine coastwise trade is limited to vessels carrying a certificate of Philippine

registry.” Section 1009 limits foreign vessels carrying import or export cargo to at most 2 stops
in Philippine ports.

63.     The Domestic Shipping Development Act (DSDA), which superseded the TCCP in 2004,
is the present basis for Philippine cabotage restrictions. Section 6 of the DSDA states that “no
foreign vessel shall be allowed to transport passengers or cargo between ports or places within
the Philippine territorial water except upon the grant of a special permit by MARINA when no
domestic vessel is available or suitable to provide the needed shipping service and public
interests warrants the same.”

64.     Currently, foreigners are allowed to engage in domestic shipping activities under 2
conditions: i) through equity infusion of at most 40 percent in a Filipino shipping company, or ii)
via a special permit as provided by Section 6 of the DSDA. Special Permits are primarily granted
to domestic companies that want to charter specialized foreign vessels that are not available in
the country. These include vessels used for oil exploration, cable-laying, and marine science
studies, among others. Special Permits for specialized foreign ships can be extended for only up
to 2 years. Domestic companies can also request to charter a foreign cargo or passenger vessel,
if there are no domestic counterparts available for the time requested (i.e., time charter). The
special permits for cargo and passenger vessels can run for a maximum of 1 year. Box 3
describes the grant of a special permit in recent years.


                                Box 3. MCC-Aboitiz joint venture

In 2007, MCC Transport Philippines was created out of a joint venture between MCC Transport
(a subsidiary of the the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk Group), a Singapore-based company, and
Aboitiz Transport Systems, a Filipino company. Due to foreign ownership restrictions, Aboitiz
held 60 percent of the equity while MCC held the remaining 40 percent. The company was set
up primarily to engage in domestic shipping within the Philippines.

In May 2007, while waiting for the delivery of a permanent ship to be used in its operations,
MCC Transport Philippines requested MARINA to grant it a special permit to operate the Dutch-
flagged Mekong Cayenne for 6 months. This vessel was used in the Manila-Cebu-Cagayan de
Oro route.

In its application, MCC Transport Philippines explained that its sister company, Aboitiz, had
recently sold 4 Superferry vessels, thereby creating a shortage in cargo handling capacity in the
country. The Dutch-flagged vessel would temporarily close the shortage created by the exit of
the Superferries until the arrival of its replacement.

MARINA granted the special permit, which commenced on June 15, 2007. Three subsequent
extensions were also granted. The final extension allowed the Dutch-flagged vessel to operate
until January 31, 2008, which went beyond the original 6 month request because of the delay in
the arrival of the replacement ship, the MV Medbay, to the country.

                                                                                                34

Cabotage regimes in other countries

65.     Most countries impose nationality restrictions on the carriage of domestic passengers
and cargo and the degree varies by country. Nationality criteria can be defined with respect to
i) provenance (i.e., where the ship was built), ii) ownership, iii) dry docking, iv) registration, and
v) crewing. In the region, Thailand has a 30 percent cap on foreign ownership while Indonesia
has a 49 percent cap. In New Zealand, the corporation need only be registered in the country,
while in the US, foreign ownership is capped at 25 percent. A number of countries also require
that the ship be registered locally, fly the flag of the country, and be crewed by local citizens.
Some countries impose restrictions on vessel importation and dry docking. Annex 3 discusses in
detail the cabotage regimes of selected countries. Table 20 presents these various nationality
criteria.

66.     Exemptions from cabotage also vary across countries, ranging from non-availability of
ship to full liberalization. Exemptions can be given for i) non-availability of ships, ii) ancillary
cargo (i.e., export and import cargo), iii) adjunct cargo (i.e., domestic cargo on the domestic leg
of foreign-flagged ships with spare capacity), and iv) specific activities. Among the countries
studied, the US is by far the most restrictive (Figure 6 and Annex 3). It strictly implements all 5
nationality criteria and gives exemptions only for extraordinary cases, such as emergency clean-
up of oil spill. The most liberal countries include UK and New Zealand (Annex 4 discusses
cabotage liberalization in New Zealand), which have basically lifted all restrictions on cabotage.
Indonesia moved from a restrictive regime to cabotage liberalization in the 1980s but moved
back to strict cabotage in 2000s (Annex 5). Most countries grant exemptions for non-availability
of ships. Malaysia and India have provided limited exemptions for ancillary cargo. Australia de
facto allows international container ships traveling between the west and east coast to carry
domestic cargo. Under the Labor Party, some degree of cabotage was re-established but the
new Liberal Party announced its intention to re-liberalize cabotage. The liberalization of
cabotage in the EU was characterized by a progressive relaxation of restrictions on specific
maritime trade components. Table 21 presents the various scope for exemptions and give some
country examples. Annex 3 discusses in detail the cabotage regimes of selected countries.

Scope for liberalizing cabotage in the Philippines

67.      There are some potential benefits to liberalizing cabotage. While the Philippines’
cabotage regime is not exceptionally restrictive relative to those of other countries in the
region, its archipelagic geography puts a premium on an efficient water transport system. The
liberalization of cabotage, which can increase competition and improve efficiency, can help
lower shipping costs and improved service quality and safety standards, with potentially
positive impact on jobs and poverty reduction.


Arguments for liberalization of cabotage restrictions

Increased efficiency and lower shipping costs

68.     Opening up the domestic shipping industry to international competition may help
increase efficiency. Under a more liberalized regime, the threat of competition from more
efficient foreign shipping companies has the potential to serve as a disciplining force or an
incentive to be more efficient, thereby lowering shipping costs. The use of larger and more
advanced foreign-flagged vessels reduces cost by taking advantage of economies of scale and
cargo consolidation. For instance, allowing the shipment of domestic cargo in the domestic leg
of an international vessel is more efficient than shipping them on several smaller domestic
ships. Similarly export and import cargo may benefit from economies of scale, as well as savings
from port charges (by around 7 percent) by avoiding unnecessary cargo transfer from a
domestic vessel to an international vessel.49 Moreover, allowing the shipment of domestic
cargo in international vessels with excess return capacity could also bring down shipping cost.
With complementary reforms in the ports sector, efficiency can be improved further. The
experience of other countries points to some benefits from cabotage liberalization.

69.    In most cases, increased competition, and hence marginal costing by international
ship operators, resulted in a significant drop in shipping rates . In the case of New Zealand,

49
     See REID (2013) for more discussion.

                                                                                                     36
Cavana (2004) estimates that since 1995, freight rates declined steadily (the year where the
liberalization of the shipping sector was implemented) between 25 and 50 percent depending
on coastal routes and type of goods transported (e.g., containers, bulk). In contrast, the
cabotage restrictions imposed by the US have resulted in notably higher shipping costs. A US
International Trade Commission report estimated that the elimination of the Merchant Marine
Act of 192050 would result in a 22 percent reduction in shipping prices (USITC 1999). This would
translate to a USD 1.32 billion welfare gain to the US economy.

Improved service and safety standards

70.     Cabotage liberalization may also improve the services and safety standards in the
maritime sector. World-class foreign technology and international good practices come with
cabotage liberalization. These may help the domestic maritime industry raise its services and
safety standards. The end results could be an improvement in the efficiency of sea travel and
freight delivery, and fewer maritime accidents.

71.     There are also environmental benefits to cabotage liberalization. A relatively recent
stem of the literature has started to examine and quantify the environmental impact of
cabotage restrictions. Such impact predominantly focuses on CO2 emissions of ships that carry
empty containers as a result of regulatory maritime restrictions including cabotage. In an
empirical case study on Canada, Kosior et al (2009) conclude that amending cabotage
provisions, through allowing a free circulation for foreign containers along coastal lines, would
increase the transport system capacity and reduce fuel consumption.

Development of a world class maritime industry

72.    Liberalization may also help the Philippines strengthen its global position as a major
provider of world class maritime manpower. The Philippines has already proven that it is a
major source of world-class maritime talent. It has more than 1 million seamen around the
world (equivalent to about 25 percent of global seafarers), including key leadership and
technical positions in major shipping companies (e.g., tankers, container ships, cruise ships). By
leveraging on world-class technology, it could also enhance its capacity to become a world-class
center of ship building and repair, and maritime studies given its comparative advantage in the
maritime sector as evidenced by its globally competitive seafarers.

Preparation for a future open ASEAN market

73.     Relaxing cabotage may also help the Philippines prepare for more intense competition
in a future open ASEAN market. One goal of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) 2015 is to
promote freer flow of investment in services. This includes maritime services. However, as

50
  The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, is a US law that regulates maritime commerce.
The law tackles cabotage and requires that all goods transported between US ports be carried by US-flagged ships,
and constructed, owned, and crewed by US citizens.

                                                                                                              37
discussed above, the Philippines is one of the worst performing countries in the region. An early
head start, by liberalizing cabotage, could hasten the entry of technology and processes that
can help the country more quickly modernize its inefficient maritime sector.

Improvement in welfare

74.    Ultimately, cabotage liberalization has the potential to help raise real income, create
more and better jobs, and reduce poverty. Cabotage liberalization, together with
complementary reforms in domestic shipping and ports, could reduce logistics cost significantly.
With improved service and safety standards, goods arrive on time and the risk of maritime
accidents is lower, thereby reducing business volatility and the need for costly insurance. These
may also contribute to lowering consumer prices and increasing business profitability. Finally,
these reforms could help the country develop its exports sector and create many jobs in
manufacturing.

75.     For instance, in countries that have liberalized its cabotage restrictions, farmers and
consequently consumers are or could be the major beneficiaries of lower freight rates. In New
Zealand, freight rates of grains from the South Island to the North Island dropped from USD 90
to USD 40 per ton (Cavana 2004) as foreign companies charged lower rates and New Zealand
shipping companies adjusted their rates downward. Using a trade gravity model, Vido (2004)
calculates that a 5 percent reduction in freight rates, arising from liberalizing the cabotage
market in Canada, could lead to a 10 percent increase in lentil exports, or USD 10 million in
improved export sales.


Arguments against cabotage liberalization and remedies

76.      On the other hand, there are concerns about the negative impact of cabotage
liberalization. The major concerns are i) the demise of the local shipping industry and the loss
of jobs, ii) uneven playing field, iii) lower tax revenues, iv) responsibility for liability, and v)
national security issues. Fortunately, many of these concerns can be addressed even if cabotage
is liberalized. Moreover, if a package of reforms is considered, which includes cabotage
liberalization, ports enhancement, and domestic shipping reforms, the short-term cost to the
industry is likely to be more than offset by the benefits accruing to the bigger economy and
even to the industry in the long-term, as other structural reforms in the country had shown.

Negative impact on the industry

77.     Foremost, there are concerns that relaxing cabotage will lead to the demise of the
local shipping industry. This concern is valid as foreign liners are likely to have modern
technologies and stronger financial position to charge lower rates. The ability of international
firms to reduce their marginal costs and cross-subsidize their Philippine operations from their
earnings elsewhere could put pressure on the profitability of domestic firms, forcing them to
cut on costs or to cease operation. The current low margins and inefficiencies of most domestic

                                                                                                 38
shipping firms make the industry highly vulnerable to foreign competition. In addition, domestic
firms are subject to the regulatory uncertainties prevalent in the Philippine maritime sector,
including extensive bureaucratic practices, disputes in the awarding of fiscal incentives, and
changing interpretations on the taxation of bareboat chartered ships, among others. Given
these, some argue that the country needs to first streamline its internal regulatory procedures
and develop its domestic shipping industry before cabotage is liberalized.51

78.     Cost cutting could lead to significant job destruction. Employment considerations are a
major concern for policymakers and cabotage restrictions are often set to protect domestic
jobs. As indicated earlier, the industry has about 18,000 formal sector jobs and it is likely that a
significant number who are working for highly inefficient shipping firms will lose their jobs.

79.     However, these negative effects need to be put in the context of the gains accruing to
the bigger economy. While it is true that domestic firms will be affected, it is also true that the
threat of competition will force them to improve their services. In this regard, a gradual and
time-bound liberalization would give domestic firms ample time to adjust. Moreover, the loss
of direct employment in the short-term needs to be compared with job creation due to forward
and backward linkages created by a more liberal maritime sector. These include direct jobs in
international shipping firms, indirect jobs in the maritime supply chain, and indirect jobs among
users of shipping services as a result of lower shipping costs and wider market access.

Uneven playing field

80.     The possible demise of the domestic shipping industry is related to concerns about an
uneven playing field. These include preferential tax rates and cheaper access to fuel and dry
docks. In taxation, foreign liners are subjected to the 3 percent common carrier tax (CCT) in lieu
of all other taxes,52 while domestic liners are subject to a 12 percent VAT and a 30 percent
corporate income tax. Foreign vessels also have a cost advantage such as cheaper fuel from
abroad (which are generally subsidized or taxed lower), and access to foreign dry docks, which
are cheaper by some 50 percent and up to 3.5 times cheaper in the case of Chinese dry docks
(IFC 2013a).

81.     Concerns about tax differential can be addressed by enacting a tonnage tax, which
could be an improved version of the CCT. Brooks (2009) defines a tonnage tax as a method of
calculating corporate income tax based on the net tonnage of the ship. The tax is charged only
on the income from the particular shipping operation as opposed to all operations of the
shipping company, which is captured by the income tax. Since international carriers are not

51
   Some would contend that the country has had enough time to do so since the deregulation of the shipping
industry in 2004. One logistics specialist commented that “If shipping comp anies have not developed, then it is
time to replace them with more productive foreign vessels.”
52
   Revenue Regulation 15-2013 of the BIR states that international air and shipping carriers doing business in the
Philippines shall pay a common carrier’s tax (i.e., a percentage tax) equivalent to 3 percent of their quarterly gross
receipts derived from the transport of cargo from the Philippines to another country.


                                                                                                                   39
subject to national profit taxes, the tonnage tax allows for more equal competition as the
difference in the cost of conducting operations between domestic and international sectors of
the industry is reduced. The tonnage tax rate can be set at a level that boosts the domestic
industry competitiveness. The tonnage tax has been used for a long time in Greece and the
Netherlands before being adopted as an EU-wide policy. It has also been adopted by Australia
and New Zealand instead of re-introducing cabotage. Other countries that have adopted the
system successfully are Panama and Liberia.

82.     Concerns about additional expenses caused by regulatory issues in the Philippine
maritime sector, such as high dry docking expense, can be addressed by streamlining laws
and regulations that indirectly increase the expenses for domestic ship owners. Laws can be
passed removing the requirement that domestic ships dry dock in the Philippines, giving
domestic ships access to cheaper dry docking facilities abroad much like their counterparts.
Clarification in the respective positions of the Bureau of Customs, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
Maritime Industry Authority, Department of Finance, and the Department of Trade and
Industry with respect to fiscal incentives and taxes on chartered vessels can facilitate access of
domestic firms to better vessels for domestic operations. Finally, streamlining the ship
registration and CPC issuance processes could provide domestic firms with greater flexibility to
compete against foreign companies.

Tax erosion

83.     Concerns that cabotage relaxation would erode tax collections have a limited horizon.
In the short-term, tax revenues are likely to fall as some firms close down or report losses, and
as some firms source cheaper inputs (e.g., fuel, repairs) from abroad. In addition, Filipino firms
can choose to re-domicile their headquarters in lower tax jurisdictions and take advantage of
differentials in tax rates and government subsidies. But even if these were to happen on a large
scale, the impact on revenues is expected to be minimal since the industry contributes little to
tax revenues in the first place. Currently, the domestic shipping industry contributes only 2
percent of total excise tax revenues for its fuel consumption, around 1 percent of total VAT
revenues (and declining), and only 0.3 percent of total corporate income tax revenues.53
Moreover, the negative effect of firms closing down or re-domiciling can be offset by setting
the tonnage tax to achieve revenue neutrality.

84.    In the long-term, tax revenues could be higher. If potential revenues are included from
the tonnage tax and higher GDP due to lower shipping costs and a bigger market, then net
incremental tax revenues from cabotage liberalization could turn out to be positive.


Responsibility for liabilities and national security


53
  The effective tax rate for the industry is estimated at 20 percent of earnings as some companies, which incurred
losses benefited from net operating loss carryover (NOLCO) and minimum corporate income tax (MCIT).

                                                                                                               40
85.      Finally, there are concerns about evading responsibility for liabilities and about
national security. Some argue that since foreign ships procure foreign insurance, it would be
difficult for Philippine authorities to run after the ship/insurance company for any liability
within Philippine waters (e.g., accidents, pollution). There are also concerns that national
security can be compromised if domestic ships are outnumbered by foreign ships, especially
Chinese vessels given current tensions with China.

Remedies for concerns

86.     Concerns about evading responsibility for liability should be manageable. The license
for foreign ships plying domestic routes or the cabotage relaxation law itself could spell out
clear provisions for insurance claims and compliance with all local regulations even if a ship sails
under a foreign flag. Moreover, local insurance can be mandated to ensure adequacy of
insurance coverage. At any rate, foreign vessels engaged in international trade and operating in
Philippine waters are subject to Philippine laws and thus strict implementation should address
this concern.

87.    Concerns about national security can be mitigated by prudent issuance of licenses to
avoid domination by foreign firms. For example, licensing can limit the market share of a
certain foreign nationality to, say, at most 30 percent. Prudent issuance of licenses can also
address concerns around cherry-picking of routes.

88.      Finally, concerns about lack of ships during national emergencies have already been
discounted. During Typhoon Yolanda, domestic cargo ships were the first to respond to the
disaster areas, even before military and navy vessels. These shipping lines provided tremendous
support in ferrying goods and relief personnel to Leyte and other affected provinces throughout
the months of November and December 2013. The worldwide outpouring of support to the
Philippines strongly suggests that foreign vessels operating in the Philippines would be equally
likely to provide a similar level of support to any local relief operations. As a case in point, the
disappearance of the Malaysian Airline jet in March 2014 saw 26 countries offering their ships
to search for signs of wreckage.54 The same can be expected in the Philippines during times of
national emergency.

                                    Options for reform


Approach to liberalization

89.     There are 2 possible modes when liberalizing cabotage: unilateral and
bilateral/multilateral. Although the ultimate objective of both modes is to increase economic
efficiency, they differ in the way the reform is conceptualized and in the immediate policy
objectives. Under a unilateral mode, liberalization is regarded as a primarily domestic economic
reform initiative where the policy objective is to intensify competition. Examples of this mode
are those taken by New Zealand and Indonesia in the 1990s. Under a bilateral/multilateral
mode, liberalization is regarded as a component of trade policy where the policy objective
includes market integration. The European Union (EU) and MERCOSUR are examples of this
mode. In the EU, cabotage liberalization took the form of reciprocal recognition of cabotage
rights between EU nations. This could serve as a model for liberalization under the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) 2015.

90.    The Philippine government has decided to take the unilateral mode when relaxing
cabotage. The advantage of this mode is that it can attain the stated objectives faster. The
disadvantage is that prior unilateral action may reduce the Philippine’s leverage in future trade
negotiations that may include relaxing cabotage restrictions. The rest of this policy note
discusses options under a unilateral mode.

91.      Within a unilateral mode, cabotage liberalization can be implemented either through
a swift and radical, or a gradual approach. Each has its own pros and cons. A swift and radical
approach implements various components of a reform simultaneously and often quickly,
building political momentum and rallying key supporters who will make implementation easier.
While this approach requires considerable political capital, the main premise is that the
speedier and more comprehensive the reform, the larger the returns. On the other hand, a
gradual approach implements the reform over a longer period of time. It may work best when
there are many uncertainties around the prospects of reforms and when incumbent
stakeholders’ opposition is so strong that a more radical approach is not feasible. It is also used
when important lessons can be learned from the implementation of earlier components. The
pace and phasing of the implementation of cabotage liberalization is dependent on the
strength of political ownership and on the stakeholders’ reciprocity . Annexes 6 to 8 discuss the
liberalization of the banking, retail trade, and the aviation sectors, respectively, and how the
gradual approach worked to their advantage. The following sections discuss what each of these
approaches entails.




                                                                                                42
A swift and radical approach to reforms

Amend the 1987 Constitution

92.    A swift and radical approach goes directly to amending the 1987 Constitution. Being
the fundamental source of cabotage, an amendment to the constitution would remove the
fundamental barrier to cabotage liberalization, making the reform swifter and more decisive.
Moreover, amending the constitution would provide a stronger legal basis for liberalizing
cabotage, as other methods, such as legislation and executive orders, without an accompanying
constitutional amendment, may not be sustainable and can be questioned before the courts.
Annex 9 investigates the constitutionality of cabotage liberalization.

Scope of the amendment

93.      The amendment involves removing the foreign ownership restriction on all public
utilities. This restriction is provided under Article XII Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution, which
limits the ownership and operation of public utilities to Filipino citizens and corporations with
at least 60 percent Filipino equity. The decision to impose a foreign equity limit can be
relegated to congress or to the president via the bi-annual Foreign Investment Negative List.
Removing the nationality restriction on all public utilities not only addresses cabotage per se,
but it also addresses in a more holistic manner one of the primary reasons for doing the reform
in the first place—reducing shipping cost. As the total cost of shipping includes inputs from
other related public utilities, such as port operation and ship repair, opening up all public
utilities to foreign competition has the potential of reducing shipping cost further than if the
reform were to focus solely on cabotage.

Actions following the constitutional amendment

94.     Following constitutional amendment, the reform can focus on enacting a new shipping
law that gradually relaxes cabotage over a specified period of time. This legislation should i)
allow foreign vessels to carry ancillary and adjunct cargo between 2 domestic ports, ii) expand
exemptions over time to explicitly include specific activities that have high economic value (see
Table 20 for a proposed list of these activities), and iii) gradually increase allowable foreign
equity from 40 to 100 percent. Concerns about a single nationality dominating the domestic
shipping industry can be alleviated by including provisions that bar a certain nationality from
having more than, say 30 percent, of the market. This would allay any fear of threat to national
security (e.g., fear of domination by Chinese vessels).


Gradual approach

95.    A gradual approach implements the reforms in phases over a longer period of time.
This could begin with steps that only require executive action, such as simplifying procedures
and maximizing the use of special permits, before moving to steps that require legislation, such

                                                                                                 43
as amending the Domestic Shipping Development Act (DSDA), and finally amending the
constitution and enacting a new shipping law that would gradually phase out cabotage. It is
important that the phasing in of reforms is time-bound, so as to avoid distortions arising from
lengthy processes.

Three-stage approach to liberalization

Maximize the use of special permits in the short-term

96.      In the short-term, cabotage can be liberalized by maximizing the use of special
permits. Section 6 of the DSDA allows the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), the regulator
of the shipping industry, to grant a temporary special permit when no domestic vessel is
available or suitable to provide the needed shipping service, and if public interest warrants the
same. Recent maritime accidents (e.g., the collision of MV St. Thomas Aquinas and Sulpicio
Express Siete in August 2013), the grounding of several ships pending MARINA investigation of
the accident, and concerns about the safety of domestic ships provide scope for granting
special permits to allow safer and possibly cheaper foreign ships to temporarily serve domestic
routes. In addition, the use of special permits can be further maximized by expanding the
notion of public interest to include lower shipping costs, especially for ships that will transport
critical goods following natural calamities (e.g., in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda).

Promote leasing, chartering, and other modes of local-foreign partnerships to facilitate access
of domestic shipping companies to better ships

97.     In the short-term, time and bareboat charters55 can be promoted to facilitate the
access of domestic firms to better ships, and more innovative maritime technologies and
practices from abroad. Chartering lowers the upfront investment cost for deploying better and
more efficient ships, particularly ships that comply with international safety standards. In
addition, the government can facilitate the licensing of combined international-domestic routes
(e.g., Hong Kong-Manila-Cebu) for domestic shipping lines. Currently, the licensing for such
routes requires special permits for each conversion from a local to an overseas route and vice-
versa. Such practice would enable local shipping companies to partner with foreign companies,
giving them access to better prices for purchasing or leasing of new ships, a larger market, and
state-of-the-art shipping management and information systems. Because of the stricter
enforcement of safety standards on international routes, this would result in an upgrading of
the domestic fleet and less maritime accidents. Most importantly, it would allow them to
maximize the cargo load of ships, with an optimum mix of domestic and export cargo.

Pursue reforms in domestic shipping in the short-term



55
  Time charter refers to leasing a vessel with its own crew. Bareboat charter refers to leasing only the vessel. The
Philippines allows time charters up to a maximum of 1 year while bareboat charter is allowed for a minimum of 1
year.

                                                                                                                 44
98.     Pending cabotage reform, laws and regulations that govern the domestic shipping
industry could be streamlined to ensure that domestic firms are not hampered in their ability
to compete with foreign players. In order to ensure a level playing field between foreign and
domestic players, laws that needlessly increase the cost of domestic shipping operations need
to be amended or repealed in advance. For the benefits of liberalization to be more
widespread, domestic firms should be allowed to access auxiliary shipping resources that
foreign firms are able to obtain, such as the chartering of vessels and ship repair facilities
abroad. For other regulatory domestic costs that cannot be easily altered, such as income tax
differentials or VAT payments on fuel, a compensating tonnage tax could be calculated and
imposed on foreign vessels.

Amend current shipping laws in the medium-term

99.      In the medium-term, cabotage can be liberalized by amending the Domestic Shipping
Development Act (DSDA). The DSDA can be amended to define what aspects of shipping can be
considered non-public utilities. For instance, the amended DSDA could distinguish between
shipping companies, which may not always be public utilities, and freight forwarders, which are
necessary public utilities since they deal with the general public. The difference is that the
former functions as the backend provider of service, which does not need to interface with the
general public, and hence can be considered a non-public utility, while the latter must deal with
the public indiscriminately. Legal precedence from similar cases lends support to this approach
(e.g., the Supreme Court recently ruled that a train system, except its ticketing system, which
interfaces with the public, is not a public utility; similarly, power generation is not a public
utility as opposed to power distribution, which is a public utility).

100. Moreover, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (TCCP) can be amended to
allow foreign ships multiple stops. Currently, Section 1009 of the TCCP limits foreign vessels
carrying import or export cargo to at most 2 stops in Philippine ports. This could be amended to
allow unlimited stops.

Amend the 1987 Constitution and enact a new shipping law in the long-term

101. In the long-term, cabotage can be liberalized by amending the 1987 Constitution and
enacting a new shipping law. This phase basically implements the swift and radical approach,
which calls for removing the foreign ownership restriction on all public utilities and relegating
the decision to impose a foreign equity limit to congress or to the president. After the
constitutional amendment, a new shipping law that gradually relaxes cabotage can be enacted.
As discussed above, amending the constitution would provide a stronger legal basis for
liberalizing cabotage, as other methods, such as using special permits and amending the DSDA
only, without an accompanying constitutional amendment, may not be sustainable and can be
questioned before the courts.




                                                                                              45
Possible provisions of the new shipping law

102. The new shipping law can identify a gradual phase-out of cabotage by making the
nationality criteria more inclusive and by relaxing the scope of exemption. Except for the use
of special permits, and the restriction on dry docking, all other forms require legislation and
could be included in the new shipping law.

Gradual liberalization of the nationality criteria

103. The nationality criteria can be made more inclusive by gradually allowing foreign
ownership, management and crewing, ship importation, and dry docking outside the country.
Like the banking sector reform, foreign ownership restrictions can be gradually relaxed from
the current 40 percent cap to no cap over a period of say 10 years. Moreover, management and
crewing at highly technical positions can also be liberalized if no Filipino qualifies for the job.
This would help Filipino shipping companies improve the quality of service and become globally
competitive. Facilitating the entry of leased vessels and other forms of vessel importation, and
allowing dry docking abroad are also needed. Finally, simplifying the process of acquiring
bareboat charters would also contribute to cabotage liberalization. Table 20 provides the
various criteria and how these could be applied to the Philippines.

104. The impact of cabotage liberalization on the competitiveness of the domestic shipping
industry depends on the nationality criteria imposed by the country. If a country imposes
restrictions on the access of firms to foreign-built ships or foreign shipyards, cabotage
liberalization could translate to the greater introduction of new shipping technologies from
abroad. If a regime prohibits the use of foreign manpower, cabotage liberalization may allow
for improved ship management and safety techniques. Eliminating restrictions to allowing firms
to ply both domestic and foreign routes could help shipping firms lower fuel costs by allowing
access to fuel from different jurisdictions. On the other hand, if cabotage restrictions pertain
only to ownership, the impact of liberalization on access to technology or fuel may not be as
significant.

                    the country.


Gradual liberalization of the scope of exemption

105. Expanding the scope of exemption can be achieved in several ways. The easiest way
involves the use of special permits, which requires no legislation. As discussed earlier,
exemptions can be given to ancillary cargo (i.e., import or export cargo) and adjunct cargo (i.e.,
domestic cargo on the domestic leg of an international vessel when there is spare capacity). It
can also be given to specific high impact activities. The most liberal form is to remove all
restrictions, which the Philippines can target after several years of gradual cabotage
liberalization. Table 21 explains the various forms of exemptions and how this could be applied
to the Philippines.

106. Special permits are allowed by law and could be used more frequently. Section 6 of
the DSDA could be interpreted more liberally to include “cheaper alternatives” and “public
safety” as allowable reasons for granting exemptions. The new shipping law could make these
reasons for granting exemptions more explicit.

107. Exemptions to ancillary (i.e., export and import) cargo have the strongest basis and
should be automatically included in the new shipping law for immediate implementation.
Export and import cargo are sensitive to price and will benefit significantly from lower freight
cost. This would make Philippine exports more competitive and reduce the cost o f imported
goods. This form of liberalization could be achieved by allowing transshipment of export or
import cargoes. Box 4 illustrates this in the case of exports. The MARINA draft bill on cabotage
liberalization proposes to allow the transshipment of ancillary cargo (see Sections 4 and 5 of the
bill).57 The bill also repeals the TCCP provisions on cabotage exemptions to simplify the law
(Section 9).

57
   This draft bill is essentially similar to the bill drafted by Congressmen Rufus Rodriguez and Maximo Rodriguez
                        th
(HB 2562) in the 15 Congress. According to the cover page of the MARINA sponsored bill: “Cabotage limits
competition and encourages inefficiency among local vessel operators since foreign vessels are not allowed to call
at more than one port for every entry within the Philippine territory. This prevents foreign vessels from calling at
multiple ports for the purpose of either loading export cargoes or discharging import cargoes. This often translates
to additional cost for shippers who need to transship their foreign cargoes through one of only a few major ports.
Local vessel operators are not forced to compete in terms of freight cost and service quality with international
vessel operators. This barrier in foreign trade must be eliminated. Foreign vessels must be allowed to engage in

                                                                                                                 48
108. As a next step, exemptions can be granted to adjunct cargo when there is spare
capacity on foreign-flagged vessels. Adjunct cargo refers to domestic cargo that can be loaded
on foreign-flagged ships traversing between 2 or more domestic ports that have spare capacity.
This would help reduce prices of domestic goods especially in routes that have volume
imbalance.

109. Finally, specific exemptions can be gradually issued for high impact activities.
Exemptions could cover i) ships traversing major exporting or importing ports (e.g., Manila,
Batangas, Subic, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, and Cebu), ii) key export or import products (e.g., oil,
electronics, bananas, mangos, pineapple, and furniture), iii) selected ships (e.g., large enough
ships to address scale issues), iv) selected players (e.g., foreign firms with joint ventures with
local firms), and v) a fixed share of the cargo space of a foreign-flagged vessel calling on several
domestic ports (e.g., up to 30 percent of cargo space). The decision for exempting specific
activities should be discussed with stakeholders to minimize distortions and ensure maximum
impact. Final decision on the scope of exemption should be included in the roadmap for easy
implementation and monitoring.


                                    Box 4. Transshipment of export cargo

Currently, foreign-flagged ships can carry import or export cargo between 2 domestic ports
but are barred from unloading the cargo and loading them to other foreign-flagged ships.
Figure 7 gives an example. Four ships are carrying export cargo from Cebu, Davao, and CDO
destined for Hong Kong via Manila. Current cabotage provisions state that the cargo cannot be
unloaded in Manila. Each ship must carry the cargo to Hong Kong, even if it is not economical.

With a relaxation of cabotage to allow for transshipment (i.e., consolidation of cargo),
foreign-flagged ships can transfer export or import cargo to another foreign-flagged ship.
Figure 9 gives an example. The same Ships 2, 3 and 4 carrying export cargo can transfer their
cargo in Manila to Ship 1 for consolidation. Only Ship 1 will make the trip to Hong Kong. This
way, shipping cost fall as ships take advantage of economies of scale.




transshipment of export and import cargoes.” The relevant provisions are found in Sections 4, 5, and 9 (with
emphasis in italics). Section 4 states that “Cabotage liberalization – the right to engage in the carriage of cargoes
shall not be limited to vessels carrying a certificate of Philippine registry, provided that said cargoes fall within the
purview of import or export cargoes…articles arriving from abroad on a foreign vessel may be carried by the same
vessel through any port of entry to the port of destination in the Philippines. Section 5 states that “…foreign ship
owners or operators may be issued the certificate of carriage of import-export cargoes. Finally, Section 9 repeals
Sections 810, 902, 903, and 1009 of the TCCP, and Sections 5, 6, and 7 of the DSDA.

Managing resistance

110. Undoubtedly, the reform of cabotage will meet some resistance. To improve the
chances of success, good preparation is essential. The preparation could include the
quantification of the cost and benefit of the reform in terms of income, price, jobs, and
implications on public finances. These inputs can help build a stronger case for the reform
during the legislative debates. The preparation could also include the conduct of a stakeholder
analysis to understand the position of different stakeholders, their ability to influence or resist
reform, and how they will be impacted by the reform. The stakeholder analysis for the
Philippines can be patterned after the methodology used in New Zealand (Box 5), which is
considered best practice as it involved a rigorous consultation process that was seen as
independent and scientific by stakeholders, and had wide ownership from government and
policymakers at various levels.




                                                                                                52
                      Box 5. Stakeholder analysis for cabotage in New Zealand

Faced with a shrinking shipping industry, the New Zealand government decided in 2000 to
evaluate a decision to re-introduce cabotage following the full liberalization of the sector in
1995. To do so, a Shipping Industry Review Committee was formed. The committee was tasked
to evaluate this policy decision and propose measures to increase the participation of the
domestic shipping industry. The quantitative analysis was limited due to an absence of
sufficient maritime statistics. This prompted the committee to conduct a thorough qualitative
assessment using the stakeholder analysis methodology.

As part of the exercise, a rigorous survey of stakeholders was conducted. The stakeholders
include: domestic ship owners, international shipping firms, port authorities, other transport
operators, worker associations, industry associations, manufacturing industries, other
producers, and special interest groups. The survey focused on a unified set of questions that
evaluated a set of indicators. Political economy considerations were used to determine the
weights used for each indicator. A stakeholder impact matrix (Table 22) was constructed to help
policymakers with their decision.58

Source: Cavana (2004) and Brooks (2009).




58
   The methodology is discussed in Cavana (2004). While some indicators can be quantified (e.g., changes in cost
structure, market size, freight rates and employment creation), the net effects from cabotage regime changes are
not always determined in terms of monetary values or contribution to GDP. The literature (e.g., Cavana 2004)
points to using force-fields analysis, or evaluating the magnitude of forces for and against change.

      Issue                                 Proposed recommendations
Shipping factors
Lack of level       Remove opportunity for incumbents to object to granting of certificate of
playing field       public convenience (CPC).

                    Focus CPC conditions on quality standard.

                    Streamline the CPC process.

                    Use a single form of CPC for both tramp and liner operators.

                    Allow greater flexibility within a CPC so that operators can adjust easily to
                    changing market conditions.

                    Simplify approval for special permits for foreign vessels to temporarily
                    operate in domestic trade.

                    Freely disseminate information to actual and potential market participants.

Low profitability   This can be indirectly addressed by liberalizing cabotage and enhancing
                    competition in the domestic shipping industry, which can both provide
                    incentives to be more efficient.

High tax rate       This can be addressed by a comprehensive reform to broaden the tax base
                    and lower the rate.

High cost of fuel   With cabotage liberalization, foreign operators engaged in genuine
                    domestic operations will be in the same boat as Philippine operators.

High cost of dry    Remove requirements for dry-docking of domestic vessels in local
docking             shipyards.

Lack of             This can be indirectly addressed by liberalizing cabotage and enhancing
investment in       competition in the domestic shipping industry, which can both provide
new ships           incentives to be more efficient.

Other factors
Lack of             In the short to medium-term, there is a need for consolidation and network
scale/domestic      planning: i) consolidate around 1 port per island group and build
market              infrastructure (e.g., arterial roads and farm-to-market roads) to connect

                                                                                                    55
                       farms (for agriculture) and cities (for manufacturing and agribusiness) to
                       the chosen port.

                       For Mindanao, this means consolidating around Cagayan de Oro (CDO)
                       port/Mindanao Container Terminal (MCT). This requires building farm-to-
                       market roads linking farms to CDO/MCT port, and other roads linking major
                       cities and towns to CDO port.

                       For Southern Luzon, this means consolidating around Batangas Port or
                       Subic Port. This would reduce congestion in Manila.

                       For Visayas, this means enhancing RORO operations and allowing
                       consortium shipping and the transportation of ancillary and adjunct cargo
                       on board international vessels (see cabotage discussion for more details).

                       In the long term, faster GDP growth will automatically lead to faster
                       increase in scale.

Conflict of            Rationalize the mandate of PPA by gradually reducing its port operations
interest in the        mandate so that it can focus exclusively on its regulatory mandate.
PPA
                       Remove the nexus between PPA revenue and cargo handling charges by
                       changing port tariff from a fixed percentage of cargo handling fee to a fixed
                       rate.

  This would allow shippers to save around 7 percent of the total pier-to-pier cost of shipping by removing
handling fees at port of origin and destination and wharfage fees at port of origin and destination. Moreover, since
under the CHARO model, the prime mover (truck) is not required to go with the chassis-mounted container on

board the RORO ship, it reduces opportunity cost as it can be used as opposed to being idle on the RORO ship
during transit. Another benefit is faster transit from warehouse to the cargo’s end destination since there is less
waiting time at the port. See REID presentation on Chassis-RORO policy for more discussion.

                Annex 4. Cabotage liberalization in New Zealand


New Zealand is an open economy that is geographically distant from its major markets. The
country consists of 2 main islands separated by the Cook Strait. One third of the population
(total population is estimated at slightly more than 4 million) is located in Auckland in the North
Island while the rest of the population is scattered mainly around manufacturing centers.

Due to its geographical remoteness, the transportation supply chain, in particular
international and coastal shipping is emphasized in the country’s economic policies. To
maintain New Zealand’s trade competitiveness, competitive shipping services with lower
pricing, reliable services, and speedy operations across the islands is crucial. Exports are a
concrete example. New Zealand’s exports of goods are dominated by agricultural, horticultural,
and forestry products, and therefore price competitiveness and success in maintaining its
exports market share are largely dependent on shipping costs. From this perspective, reform of
cabotage came into place.

Like most other countries, New Zealand had a restrictive cabotage regime. Despite
considerable restructuring of its shipping industry prior to 1994, foreign vessels could still not
load and unload cargo and passengers at domestic ports, except in narrow cases where no local
vessels exist. Exemptions required special permits from the Ministry of Transport. Such
cabotage restrictions were considered as an impediment to the country’s open economy
policies.

The liberalization of the coastal shipping market in New Zealand came into effect in February
1995. It was envisaged to form part of the creation of a trans-Tasman free market with
Australia, one of the country’s major trading partners. The liberalization of this market had
taken place as part of a comprehensive economic reform program tackling most sectors,
including international trade along with industrial, transport, labor, monetary, and fiscal
policies. This reform effort, pushed by a new governance and public management drive that
started in 1984, transformed the country from a highly regulated economy to one of the most
liberal in the world.

Cabotage liberalization encountered a number of challenges. Legislation introduced in 1993
initially included the full opening of coastal transport, allowing foreign vessels to operate freely
on all ports. However, this had to be modified following pressures from the domestic shipping
industry. The modified Maritime Transport Act of 1994 was passed as a compromise. It allowed
international vessels to load and upload domestic cargo along New Zealand’s coast provided
that they originally enter the country to deliver imports or upload exports. While there was no
restriction on the nationality of the operator, permanent coastal operation must be New
Zealand-based. The chartering of foreign-flagged vessels was also liberalized.

Liberalization has led to a significant reduction in freight rates and consequently reduced
transportation costs. This came primarily as a result of improved carrier utilization capacity

                                                                                                 70
through the open access regime, and as clients had more operator choices. However, this
meant that domestic operators saw their profit margins cut down. Despite increases in trade
volumes as the economy grew, domestic shipping was not reaping the revenues as it faced
fierce competition from international operators. In 2000, 21 vessels operated by 9 companies
provided coastal shipping services compared to 19 vessels operated by 10 companies in 1994.
Domestic industry participation seemed to not have achieved its expansionary objective.

Faced with this issue, the New Zealand government decided in 2000 to evaluate a decision to
re-introduce cabotage. A Shipping Industry Review Committee was formed for this purpose.
The committee was tasked to evaluate this policy decision and propose measures to increase
the participation of the domestic shipping industry. The quantitative analysis was limited due to
an absence of sufficient maritime statistics. This prompted the committee to conduct a
thorough qualitative assessment using a stakeholder analysis methodology. The review
highlighted that New Zealand ship owners, workers, and maritime industry associations were
supportive of re-introducing cabotage, arguing that it would provide more jobs for the locals
and make the domestic industry more sustainable over the long term. However other
stakeholders, including international ship operators, ports, freight and distribution services,
manufacturers, and primary goods producers were against the re-introduction of cabotage,
claiming that it would lead to higher domestic and international freight rates, loss of jobs,
businesses, and exports, higher fuel usage, negative environmental effects, and a decline in
regional economic activity.

The overall conclusion reached was against the re-introduction of cabotage as an option for
enhancing the domestic economy as this was estimated to lead to negative net returns for
the economy. Instead, recognizing the strong support and subsidies provided by many
countries to their respective shipping industries, the committee recommended leveling the
playing field between international and domestic sectors of the industry to ensure fair
competition. Concrete measures were proposed to achieve this objective and boost New
Zealand’s shipping industry participation. These included the introduction of a tonnage tax and
a second vessels register.61

    A second register is a concept introduced in 1987 by Norway and the Netherlands in response to the
proliferation of “convenience flags,” in which ships carry the flag of countries such as Panama or Liberia that have
little regulation. The second register allows vessels of home countries to operate with less restrictions (e.g., on
hiring foreign labor and paying taxes). For more discussion, see Carlisle (2009).

Annex 5. Liberalization and de-liberalization in the Indonesian shipping
                                industry


The Indonesian shipping industry has gone through several regulatory changes. From a highly
regulated and centralized industry following its independence in 1945, it underwent a period of
liberalization between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. However, with the fall of the Suharto
regime in 1998, the industry was de-liberalized, which continues to be in effect today.

From colonial times to the mid-1980s, the Indonesian shipping industry was highly centralized
and regulated on all aspects of the industry, including cabotage. Before attaining
independence, the country’s inter-island shipping industry was a virtual monopoly controlled by
the Dutch company Koninkljke Paketvaart Maatschappij (KPM or Royal Packet Company). After
independence, the Indonesian government decided to nationalize the industry and reduce the
role of KPM in inter-island shipping. The government encouraged private operators to enter the
market, established a state-owned inter-island shipping corporation, and implemented
regulatory controls on tariffs and operating conditions. The result was chaotic as local firms
were largely inexperienced. To restore order, the government created the Ministry of Shipping
to oversee the industry in terms of routes, vessel allocation, rates, and capacity. At the same
time, as part of its economic nationalism policy, the government ordered the strict
implementation of cabotage in the mid-1970s.

Despite these measures, the industry continued to underperform. The “mass of inconsistent
and unworkable regulations” led to severe noncompliance and/or bribery to circumvent these
regulations. The bureaucracy was inefficient and corruption was the norm. These contributed
to a serious erosion of maritime safety. With a weak regulatory environment, the Indonesia
National Shipowners Association (INSA) established itself as a strong lobby group. Their
influence culminated in the re-establishment of cabotage three decades later.

Beginning in the mid-80s, the industry was gradually liberalized, culminating in 1988 with the
issuance of PP 17/1988. The collapse of oil prices from their 1981 peak threatened the
country’s fiscal and external stability. The government, led by strong technocrats, responded by
pursuing an export-driven growth strategy geared towards the promotion of non-oil exports.
Central to the success of this policy was the removal of regulatory obstacles that hindered the
growth of trade. These included regulations that protected the shipping industry. The
government also began to rebalance policy objectives from protecting the needs of shipping
firms to protecting the needs of the users. Liberalization under 2 presidential directives, Inpres
4/1985 and PP 17/1988, allowed domestic shipping companies to own or charter foreign-
flagged vessels for domestic trade at their discretion.62 It also allowed foreign-flagged ships to

Pemerintah, which translates to “government regulation”.

                                                                                                                72
trade between foreign ports and Indonesian ports, provided that they appointed a local agent,
which no longer needed to be a domestic shipping company.63

Available studies suggest that liberalization led to a number of positive outcomes. The
shipping industry grew significantly as old firms expanded and new firms entered the industry
(Dick 2008).64 The industry also modernized with the accelerated conversion of break bulk
cargo to container cargo. However, the share of domestic cargo carried on Indonesian-flagged
vessels declined from over 90 to just 50 percent (Dick 2008). However, a number of foreign
firms appeared to be intrinsically Indonesian firms which decided to register in Singapore to
avoid the regulatory costs imposed by the Indonesian bureaucracy (Dick 2008). The relaxation
of cabotage put pressure on the better-performing Indonesian shipping firms to meet
international service standards in order to remain in business (Dick 2008). Shipping costs
reportedly declined and service quality improved (Dick 2008). A few Indonesian shipping
companies also grew to become regional players (Dick 2008). These facilitated regional
integration, and contributed to the strong growth of trade and labor intensive manufacturing
(Hill 2000 and Thee 2003).

However, liberalization was short-lived as the country began to protect its domestic shipping
industry in 1999. The fall of the Suharto regime in May 1998 saw a number of policy reversals.
In shipping, opponents of liberalization were successful in pushing for the return of cabotage.
The Asian Financial Crisis, which crippled the domestic shipping industry, was used as a pretext
for bringing back cabotage. Under the term of President Habibie, PP 82/1999, which repealed
PP 17/1988, re-regulated the shipping industry.65 It required Indonesian flagged-ships to be
built by Indonesian shipbuilders and declared in principle the return of cabotage. However,
cabotage only took effect after Inpres 5/2005 was enacted.

In 2008, the initial steps taken to re-regulate the shipping industry were strengthened by
legislation. Law 17/2008, which restated PP 82/1999 and Inpres 5/2005, contained a stronger
and clearer statement on cabotage.66 The law restricted domestic sea transport to Indonesian
shipping companies using only Indonesian-flagged vessels and crewed by Indonesians. Foreign-
flagged vessels which were operating at the time of the law’s enactment were given 2 options:
cease operation by May 2011 or form a joint venture with an Indonesian company with
majority of the shares held by the Indonesian company. Violations are treated as a criminal
offense. Government Regulation No. 22 of 2011 exempted from cabotage vessels that do not
63
   Other provisions of Inpres 4/1985 and PP 17/1988 were as follows: i) customs clearance was transferred from
the government to the Swiss firm, Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), ii) licensing was simplified, and iii) routes
were liberalized, subject to safety requirements and reporting.
64
   For example, between 1980 and 1999, merchant fleet capacity grew by 130 percent, while total number of
Indonesia’s merchant fleet doubled in size (source: Lloyd’s Register of Shipping: Statistical Tables).
65
   The return of cabotage under the Habibie regime was no surprise, as the president, during his term as minister
of research and technology in the 1980s, had identified ship building as one of the strategic industries of Indonesia
and called for the protection and strengthening of the industry.
66
   Law 17/2008 was enacted by parliament, making it stronger than Inpres 5/2005, which was a presidential
directive. Apart from reinforcing PP 82/1999 and Inpres 5/2005, Law 17/2008 tackled other pertinent issues such
as the simplification of licensing and the separation of the port authority’s regulatory and operational functions.

                                                                                                                    73
transport goods or people, which includes vessels in the oil and gas industry as a result of the
unavailability of domestic ships. Foreign vessels can apply for special permits valid for three
months.

The same studies claimed that the return of cabotage contributed to the growth of the
domestic shipping industry. From 2005 to 2010, the number of domestic vessels increased by
63 percent from 6,041 in 2005 to 9,835 in 2010 (Asrofi 2011). The share of domestic freight
held by the domestic shipping industry increased from 55 percent in 2005 to 95 percent in the
first quarter of 2010 (Asrofi 2011). This, however, does not automatically reflect new demand
as the high growth could reflect the reflagging of Indonesian-owned ships from Singaporean
flag to Indonesian flag.

At the macro level, cabotage de-liberalization allegedly came at the expense of the wider
economy. Increased bureaucratic regulation reportedly contributed to higher compliance and
shipping costs (Dick 2008). The lack of competition as a result of cabotage led to artificially high
inter-island shipping cost and lower shipping efficiency, thereby discouraging trade (Dick 2008).

     Annex 6. Gradual liberalization of the Philippine banking industry67


Until fairly recently, the Philippines restricted foreign participation in the country’s domestic
banking industry. The General Banking Act of 1948 (Republic Act 337) set a 40 percent cap on
foreign ownership in any domestic banking institution. It also limited the entry of foreign banks
as stated in Section 14 of the same act.68 The law, however, exempted 4 foreign banks that
were already operational in the Philippines prior to RA 337. These banks were subjected to
strict conditions such as limits on investments made using deposits within the territorial limits
of the Republic of the Philippines. The rural banking industry was protected the most. In 1992,
the Rural Bank Act (RA 7353) mandated that rural banks should be fully-owned by Filipinos
(Section 4).

The Philippine banking industry was gradually liberalized in the last two decades. In 1994, the
Foreign Bank Liberalization Act (RA 7221) was signed into law. It aimed to create a more
competitive environment for the banking industry and encourage more foreign participation.
RA 7221 provides 3 modes of entry for foreign banks: i) by acquiring, purchasing, or owning up
to 60 percent of the voting stock of an existing bank, ii) by investing in up to 60 percent of the
voting stock of a new banking subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the Philippines, or iii)
by establishing up to three branches with full banking authority. However, entry was limited to
only 10 new foreign banks, and was subject to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ strict guidelines
for approval.69

Liberalization progressed with the enactment of the General Banking Law (RA 8791) of 2000.
RA 8791 allowed foreign banks to acquire up to 100 percent of voting stock in only one
domestic bank within a 7-year period from the effectiveness of the law. In 2013, RA 10574,
amended the Rural Bank Act of 1992. It allowed foreigners to acquire up to 60 percent of the
voting stock in rural banks. Finally, in June 2014, a law was passed allowing foreign banks 100
percent participation in the domestic banking industry.

The impact on FDI inflow into the banking sector was astonishing. Within 3 years of the 1994
liberalization, 10 foreign banks entered the Philippines, bringing a total FDI inflow of USD 4
billion from an average of USD 233 million in the preceding 12 years. The same was also true for
the insurance sector, which followed a similar liberalization schedule.

   Section 14 of RA 337 states that ‘no foreign bank or banking corporation formed, organized or existing under the
laws other than those of the Republic of the Philippines shall be permitted to transact business in the Philippines…’
69
   Section 3 of RA 7721 lists the guidelines of approval for foreign bank entry. Among some of the stricter
guidelines of entry are: i) Only those among the top 150 foreign banks in the world or top 5 banks in their country
of origin as of the date of application shall be allowed entry in accordance with Section 2, ii) In order to qualify to
establish a branch or a subsidiary, the foreign bank applicant must be widely-owned and publicly-listed in its
country of origin, unless the foreign bank applicant is owned by the government of its country of origin.

     Annex 7. Gradual liberalization of the Philippine retail trade industry


The Philippines moved from a liberal retail trade regime to a protected regime in the 1950s,
and then to partial liberalization in 2000. In 1954, the Retail Trade Nationalization Act Republic
Act [RA 1180] gave the sole right to participate in the country’s retail trade industry to Filipino
citizens or corporations wholly-owned by Filipinos (Section 1). The law was originally intended
to protect Filipino retailers from immigrant Chinese retailers, who at the time controlled
around 60 percent of the retail trade industry.70 It, however, provided a transitory provision
which allowed non-Filipinos, who at the time of the enactment of RA 1180, were engaged in
retail trade to continue operation until death or voluntary retirement from the business. In the
case of corporations or partnerships not wholly-owned by Filipino citizens, these entities were
given a maximum of 10 years to cease operation.

The retail trade sector was partially liberalized in 2000 in a bid to promote consumer welfare
and improve competition. The Retail Trade Liberalization Act (RA 8762) amended RA 1180,
allowing foreigners to engage in retail trade subject to certain restrictions. Under the law,
foreigners can own retail establishments that have a minimum paid-up capital of USD
2,500,000. For establishments engaged in high-end or luxury products, the minimum paid-up
capital is lower at USD 250,000. Other restrictions are:

        All retail trade enterprises under Categories B and C,71 where foreign ownership exceeds
         80 percent of equity, shall offer a minimum of 30 percent of their equity to the public
         through the Philippine Stock Exchange within eight years from commencing operations
         (Section 7).

        Foreign retailers must have a minimum net worth of USD 200,000,000 in an enterprise’s
         parent corporation for Categories B and C, and USD 50,000,000 in an enterprise’s parent
         corporation for Category D (Section 8).

        After 10 years from the approval of RA 8762, at least 30 percent of the aggregate cost of
         the stock inventory for Categories B and C, and 10 percent for category D shall be made
         in the Philippines (Section 9).

     Annex 8. Gradual liberalization of the Philippine aviation industry72


Between 1972 and 1995, the Philippines had a one-airline policy. The monopoly was operated
by Philippine Airlines (PAL).73 The 1987 Constitution declared that the state shall regulate or
prohibit monopolies when the public interest so requires. However, it was only in 1995 when
the country’s one-airline policy was abolished with the enactment of Executive Order (EO) 219.

The liberalization of the Philippine aviation industry began in 1995 when the domestic sector
was opened up to competition. This reform was part of a broader civil aviation reform to
address 3 main issues: i) airport congestion in Manila, ii) poor performance of international
tourism, and iii) inefficiencies in the domestic aviation market. In the domestic sector, in which
the reform was most successful, EO 219 allowed new domestic airlines to operate freely and to
complement or establish new routes. In the international sector, EO 219 allowed the
designation of a second flag carrier.74 All other areas, such as foreign ownership and control,
tariff setting, freedom of the air rights,75,76,77 and participation in the domestic market (i.e.,
cabotage having been in effect), remained closed to competition.

The second phase of the liberalization happened in the 2000s with the partial liberalization of
the international sector. In 2001, EO 500, as amended by EO 500-A, allowed unlimited third78
and fourth79 freedoms of the air rights to foreign carriers serving the Clark International Airport
and the Subic Bay International Airport. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was tasked to
evaluate and approve applications for these rights.

Liberalization in the international sector was further expanded in 2011. EO 29 gave the
Philippine Air Panels80 the authority to grant third, fourth, and fifth81 freedom of air rights,

   The monopoly was very inefficient. Flights were limited and largely flew out from Manila and, to a lesser extent,
from Cebu. Service was characterized by frequent flight delays, cancellations, and high passenger ticket prices and
freight costs (World Bank 2013).
74
   However, implementation of EO 219 was partly delayed as the implementing rules and regulations were not
passed until 2001.
75
   EO 219 allowed only the first 2 freedoms of the air. The third and fourth freedoms were determined based on
reciprocity and value for the Philippines.
76
   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the first freedom of the air as “the right or privilege,
in respect of scheduled international air services, granted by one State to another State or States, to fly across its
territory without landing.”
77
   The ICAO defines the second freedom of the air as “the right or privilege, in respect of scheduled international
air services, granted by one State to another State or States, to land in its territory for non-traffic purposes.”
78
   The ICAO defines the third freedom of the air as “the right of an airline o f one country to carry traffic from its
country of registration to another country.”
79
   The ICAO defines the fourth freedom of the air as “the right of an airline of one country to carry traffic from
another country to its own country of registration.”
80
   Executive Order 28 series of 2011 reconstituted and reorganized the single negotiating Philippine Air Panel
(established by EO 32 series of 2001) into the Philippine Air Negotiating Panel and the Philippine Air Consultation

                                                                                                                     77
subject to conditions of national interest, to all foreign carriers flying into all Philippine airports
except the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. However, Section 5 of EO 29 explicitly states
that “in no case shall the CAB grant to any foreign air carrier cabotage traffic rights of any kind.”

               Annex 9. Constitutionality of cabotage liberalization

Under Article XII, Section 11 of the Constitution, no franchise, certificate, or any other form of
authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the
Philippines or to Philippine corporations whose capital is at least 60 percent owned by
Filipinos. Simply stated, if an activity is deemed to be a public utility, then the citizenship
requirement applies. Any form of legal liberalization allowing foreign firms to enter the market
could be termed as unconstitutional. Broadly defined, the transport of goods by shipping
vessels has been generally understood to be a public utility.

Despite this Constitutional provision, the term “public utility” is defined neither by the
Constitution nor by Philippine laws, but only by jurisprudence; only the term “public service”
has been defined by law. Through the Public Service Act of 1936, “public service” has been
defined as firms that own, operate, manage or control in the Philippines, for hire or
compensation, with general or limited clientele, whether permanent, occasional or accidental
and done for general business purposes, in a pre-defined set of industries, including common
carriers, railroads, water transport, public warehouses, telephone, electric light, shipyards, and
ice plants, among others.

The term “public utility” implies not only service to the public but also public use. Legally, this
means that not all public services are interpreted to be public utilities and the term “public
service” has a broader scope as compared to a public utility. It is not always necessary, in order
to be a public service, that an organization be dedicated to public use; it is only necessary that it
must in some way be impressed with public interest. Thus, a business may be affected by public
interest and regulated for public good, although not be under any duty to serve the public.

The previous statutory definition of a public utility was abandoned because the concept of
public service did not exactly fit the concept of public utility. The lack of statutory definition
may be due to several reasons: i) “public utility” is difficult to define, ii) it is a judicial question,
or iii) the legislative determination may either be upheld or struck down by the Court.

Since there is no statutory declaration yet, the definition of the term “public utility” is
judicially determined. Supreme Court decisions provide judicial pronouncements as to what
defines a public utility. These include businesses or services engaged in regularly supplying the
public with some commodity or service of public consequence such as electricity, gas, water,
transportation, telephone or telegraph service. The principal determinative characteristic of a
public utility is that of service to, or readiness to serve, an indefinite public or portion of the
public as such, which has a legal right to demand and receive its services or commodities.

On the one hand, legislative enactments may declare whether or not a business or activity is
a “public utility.” Some laws have declared that a particular activity within a public service
industry is not a public utility, including power generation (RA 9136 Electric Power Industry
Reform Act of 2001) and ship building and ship repair (PD 666). These laws have been cited by
the Courts in later jurisprudence. Laws may also declare that certain activities or businesses are

                                                                                                      79
public utilities, such as transportation of passengers (Act 2307), ice plants (Act 2694), and
petroleum operation (RA 387). However, there are certain cases wherein the legislative
declarations were overturned by the Courts.

Such laws may be subject to judicial review to determine whether they contravene the
Constitution. The Supreme Court has made previous declarations that the “legislature cannot,
by its mere declaration, make something a public utility which is not in fact such; and a private
business operated under private contracts with selected customers and not devoted to public
use cannot, by legislative fiat or by order of a public service commission, be declared a public
utility, since that would be taking private property for public use without just compensation. ”
Firms such as Tan Piaco (trucking of passengers and freight), Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage (cold
storage) and Petron (oil refining) were previously declared to be outside the scope of public
utilities. They all operated businesses categorized by law as Public Services, but primarily
engaged in activities under strictly private contracts and were never devoted by its owners for
public use.

In terms of cabotage liberalization, certain activities involving domestic shipping could be
declared by legislation as not being public utilities, so long as they can clearly be argued to
not involve public use or not regularly supply the public with commodities or services of
public consequence. For example, a law could be passed allowing the transshipment of import
and export cargo in international ports through a redefinition of “coastwise trade”.
Additionally, separate legal arguments could be made that yachts-for-hire, specialized cargo
transport, or scientific exploration, among other examples, are not deemed to be public utilities
by indicating that a limited public could use these services.

By extension, it could potentially be argued that cargo vessels for limited hire, such as those
that deal solely with a limited set of third party consolidators or freight forwarding
companies, do not deal with the general public and are therefore not public utilities. This
form of shipping activity is different from cargo handling operators who enter into direct
contracts with shippers and consignees. Since the contract of transportation will be entered by
the foreign ship owner and freight forwarders, it may be considered that the use of vessels for
transporting cargo within the Philippines involves particular persons (freight forwarders) under
strictly private contracts. As such, the vessels are never devoted by their owners to public use.
It should also be noted that these types of ship owners may not be legally obligated to render
their services indiscriminately to the public.

Therefore, there may be other activities involving shipping which may be classified as “public
service” yet do not fall under the definition of public utilities. The citizenship requirement
under the Constitution applies to the operation of public utilities. The Deliberations of the
Constitutional Commission states that shipping is a “public utility,” which was defined as
“services which are vital for the delivery of services for the public”. It may be implied that some
services are not vital for the delivery of services to the public. Therefore, not all forms of
shipping may be classified as public utilities. If the ship owners are not under any duty to serve


                                                                                                80
the public, legislation may declare that these are considered as providing “public service” only,
wherein the nationality requirement does not apply.

However, it must be restated that such laws stating which modes of shipping will not be
defined as public utilities (and therefore open to foreign companies) will be subject to judicial
review to determine whether these laws are constitutional. The extent to which these
shipping activities can be legally defined as not having the characteristics of public service and
public use will determine the shipping activities subject to cabotage reform without a
constitutional amendment. Given the lack of clarity in the legal definitions of the “public
utility” concept, such a law would still have a significant risk of being declared unconstitutional.
As such, great care must be taken in drafting legislation that specifies the particular modes of
shipping that operate outside the definition of a “public utility.”
