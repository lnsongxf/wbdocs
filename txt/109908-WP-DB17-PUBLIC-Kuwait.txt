This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      the Ministry. These drawings include air-conditioning, lighting and all
      other electrical equipment, electrical mains, switches, cable sizes, circuit
      breakers and fuses. The client will also need to submit a load form in
      order to obtain inspection of internal wiring and final connection. The
      load form will then be handed over to the applicant themselves. If the
      applicant is a company, the form will be handed over to an authorized
      staff of the company. The approval itself is granted after a couple of
      weeks, but is obtained in parallel with the external works. The inspection
      however, happens only after the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)
      has obtained the letter of no-objection from the municipality. If the
      drawings meet the Ministry’s specifications, then inspectors from the
      Electrical Installation Department of the Ministry will inspect the internal
      installation (size of cables, type of fuses, cable connection process and
      installation of main panels and sub-panels inside and outside the
      warehouse). The engineer also needs to submit approvals from the
      Municipality and the Kuwait Fire Department. The Municipality will also
      check that plans are actually corresponding to latest drawings.

      Once the drawings are approved, the client needs to pay the fees of the
      project to Ministry of Electricity & Water (MEW) for the power supply
      connection. This cost is for the equipment supplied by the ministry. The
      payment is done at the estimation department of MEW. The estimation
      department then gives the green light to the Electrical Distribution
      Networks Department so that external works can be started.
      External works are designed and carried out by the Electrical Distribution
      Networks Department of MEW. A 140-kVA load can be supplied from an

      the transformer installed will not result in additional cost to the

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The seller must request a Cadastral Description Certificate from the
       Municipality providing the details of the property in question (i.e. its size,
       the developments on it, the zoning, etc) and confirming that the
       property is in compliance with all the Municipality regulations. This
       document is prepared following an inspection of the property by an
       architect of the Municipality. The warehouse is likely to be in one of the
       following areas; Shuwaikh, Sulaibiya, Sabhan, Al Rai, Anghara and Ardiya.
       This is however not an exclusive list. The Kuwait Municipality, which is the
       authority responsible for zoning, may authorize the construction of a
       warehouse in an area that is not ordinarily used for warehousing. The
       documentation shall include: Application from the seller on the selling

       property has incurred (e.g. non-maintenance of the property, or
       encroachment of the property borders on neighboring plots), any
       violations of the structure (e.g. if the building does not meet the fire
       regulations), usage of the plot (e.g. for commercial or residential
       purpose). Any licenses granted to the plot (e.g. license to have machinery
       brought onto the property to be used on the plot) and drawings of the
       plot and structures approved from the Municipality showing the areas
       and utilization of the plot.

      Inspection of the property by an architect representing the
      Municipality

      The Municipality will send out an inspector/architect to inspect the
      property in question and collect the relevant information; after which the
      Municipality will issue the Cadastral Description Certificate and transfer
      the same along with a letter of no objection to the transfer to the
      Ministry of Justice to continue the process of the property transfer.
      It ordinarily takes between 7 – 12 days for the inspection of the property
      that is located within the Capital Province by an architect/engineer
      representing the Municipality. For properties located in the other
      provinces, the process may be shorter or longer depending on the work
      load of the Municipality officials.
      The process is typically as follows: the seller will go to the Municipality
      (with jurisdiction over the location of the warehouse to be sold) to
      submit an application for an allocation letter (specifying the size of the
      plot and the buildings on it if any) and a description certificate                7-12 days
      (description of the existing buildings if any on the plot and size/use of      (simultaneous

      such building). The fee to be paid for these documents is KD150 (for a        with Procedures
      commercial property). The seller concurrently delivers the warehouse's           3, 4, and 5)
      title deed to the Municipality against a receipt thereof. The
      engineer/architect responsible for the area then fixes a date to meet with
      the seller at the warehouse to carry out the inspection, or may
      alternatively carry out the inspection on his own. Meanwhile, the seller
      should obtain clearance from the utility authorities (i.e. electricity, water
      and telephone). When the Municipality engineer completes the
      inspection and the Municipality has issued the descriptions certificate
      and the allocation letter for the property, the seller will be issued with a
      receipt with a reference number from the Municipality with which the
      seller will receive the original title deed, the allocation letter and the
      descriptions certificate from the Real Estate Registry Division at the
      Ministry of Justice.

      The parties must appear in person or through their attorneys to sign the
      sale agreement before the notary public. The notary public verifies the
      contents of the written agreement (a form commonly prescribed by the
      Ministry of Justice), authenticates the required signatures, and satisfies all
      other related matters. The notary public is a governmental employee in
      Kuwait providing public service and is part of the Ministry of Justice.
      The process may however take a longer (two working weeks at most) or
      shorter time frame depending on characteristics of the transaction (i.e. if
      it is a contentious issue) or the work load in the Ministry at the time of
      application. The duration of the process may also be affected by the
      identity of the entities or people involved (i.e. the process is relatively
      shorter and more straight forward for individuals while companies will
      likely take a longer period of time as more documentation is required –           3 days        no cost

      e.g. board resolutions, minutes of meetings, etc). Furthermore, if the
      warehouse price reflected in the sale agreement is considered to be
      below the market value/price, the Ministry in such case may dispatch an
      expert to carry out a valuation of the warehouse to avoid any loss that
      may be incurred by the Ministry when it collects the transfer charges that
      are 0.5% of the property value. The process of the valuation of the
      warehouses may take approximately 5 - 10 days (one to two working
      weeks). The parties must either appear in person or send an attorney
      authorized to act on their behalf (holder of a Power of Attorney). The
      parties or their legal representatives have their IDs checked and are
      given an appointment 3 days later to come back for payment and final
      signing of the deed.

        number on the notarized sale agreement (which is the new title deed for
        the property) at the time of signing the agreement before the notary

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                               The foreclosure procedure takes approximately 4.2 years until BizBank is repaid
                               some or all of the money owed to it. The delay is largely due to the difficulty in

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
