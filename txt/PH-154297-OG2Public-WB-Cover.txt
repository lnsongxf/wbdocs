                       Abstract

                   From Pork to Performance illuminates the politics of how public resources are spent and the
                   difficulty of the “last mile” of service delivery. Crumbling facilities, absentee teachers, and roads
                   to nowhere waste resources and retard development in many countries around the world. These
                   failures in last mile service delivery underscore a more intractable development problem – a
                   breakdown in accountability relationships – as politicians and civil servants act with impunity to
                   extract private benefits at the expense of public goods. This study examines the extent to which
                   technology and transparency can disrupt this low accountability status quo through turning
                   information into collective action to improve government performance by strengthening the
                   accountability relationships between politicians, service providers and citizens.

                   In 2010, a new president came to power in the Philippines with a compelling message – “no
                   corruption, no poverty” – and embraced open government as a vehicle to burn avenues of retreat
                   and advance governance reforms. This study features examples from five sectors - education,
                   reconstruction, roads, municipal development, and tax collection – where government champions
                   sought to open up the black box of service delivery and use digital platforms to disclose data and
                   strengthen accountability. This research provides guidance for public, private, and civil society
                   leaders committed to using technology and transparency to curb pork-barrel politics and create
                   digital dividends for their communities. The study combines rigorous political economy analysis
                   with practical diagnostic tools and recommendations for open government initiatives to go deeper
                   in the Philippines and around the world.

From Pork to Performance: Open Government and Program Performance Tracking in the Philippines. 2016. S. Custer, H. Rahemtulla, K. Kaiser, R. van den Brink        V
       Foreword

     Roads, schools, and taxes are public goods that citizens depend upon every day. While there is a
     complex pipeline of decisions involved in delivering a service, for the vast majority of people their
     singular impression of government performance is at the “last mile” – on the road, in the classroom,
     and at the tax office. When governments fail to deliver accessible, predictable, and high quality
     public goods, we can all relate to the pain points, from disconnected roads to absentee teachers.

     The report Pork to Performance describes breakdowns in the delivery of public goods that are
     symptomatic of a deeper root issue: a stunted feedback loop where poor information creates
     friction and perpetuates anemic performance. With limited visibility on how public resources are
     spent and services delivered, citizens and policymakers have little recourse to question the status
     quo or make course corrections. As a result, citizens do not sanction politicians for poor results and
     civil servants receive a perverse signal that future performance need not change.

     The World Development Report 2004, Making Services Work for Poor People, points to two routes
     to close this feedback loop – one short and one long. In the “short” route, citizens directly engage
     with the frontline providers of public services such as school administrators or local government
     officials. In the “long” route, citizens use advocacy and voting for politicians and policy-makers
     to indirectly shape public service provision. Regardless of which route one takes, access to timely,
     relevant, and actionable information on public resources and performance is a critical ingredient to
     shift the conversation from the politics of “pork” to one of accountability for results.

     In the Philippines and around the world, there has been an explosion of interest in leveraging
     technology, information, and participation for more accountable governance. Over the past decade,
     increasingly ubiquitous mobile phones and Internet access are transforming the way we live, work,
     and communicate. A growing number of countries are pairing these technology advances with
     transparency commitments, as they adopt open data initiatives and embrace open government
     principles as the new default. For reform-minded governments, this digital revolution presents an
     opportunity to fundamentally reshape how they make decisions, deliver services, and interact with
     citizens. Essentially, the aspiration is that technology can assist government programs in becoming
     more responsive and effective in generating public goods.

     Yet, as the World Development Report 2016 on Digital Dividends underscores, digital development
     has the potential to divide as well as unify. Enthusiasts extoll the value of technology-enabled
     transparency to democratize information. However, the early adopters of these new technologies
     are more likely to be young, urban, educated, and affluent. Skeptics point to an overemphasis
     on technology at the risk of ignoring weak institutions and perverse “rules of the game”. The
     popularity of digital platforms to disclose public sector information has prompted criticism that
     governments pursue open data as an alternative, rather than a complement, to more durable
     freedom of information laws and view open government as a way to divert attention from a lack of
     progress on more difficult public financial management (PFM) reforms.

     From Pork to Performance illuminates the conditions under which transparency and technology
     are likely to disrupt the status quo and make politics work to improve public services. The study
     provides a much-needed framework to more systematically analyze the ability of technology-
     enabled open government initiatives to strengthen accountability, reduce information
     asymmetries, and spark constructive dialogue about service delivery priorities and results. Jointly
     produced by AidData at the College of William & Mary and the World Bank Group, From Pork to
     Performance provides a set of invaluable diagnostic tools for these initiatives to monitor progress,
     measure impact, and achieve their goals.




VI               From Pork to Performance: Open Government and Program Performance Tracking in the Philippines. 2016. S. Custer, H. Rahemtulla, K. Kaiser, R. van den Brink
                   The debate about the possibilities and limits of technology-enabled transparency to enhance
                   accountability and service delivery is particularly poignant in the Philippines. As the report
                   highlights, the Philippines achieved an admirable recovery in recent years, garnering accolades for
                   transparency and growth following decades of uneven governance and economic performance.
                   A founding member of the Open Government Partnership in 2011, the government viewed open
                   government as a means to restore public trust and realize inclusive growth. Nonetheless, the
                   Philippines has not passed a freedom of information law and crosscutting reforms that would
                   facilitate tracking of the national budget have stalled in the face of bureaucratic resistance.

                   Inspired by the country’s first open data portal (data.gov.ph) and cognizant of the challenges
                   in moving large-scale PFM forward, several champions within government sought creative
                   workarounds to push forward a more bounded set of reforms. The World Bank Group partnered
                   with these government champions to design a series of digital accountability platforms to
                   disclose information on the whole service delivery chain – from upstream budgets to downstream
                   implementation – within a given sector. The platforms intended to bolster internal financial
                   management systems and make it easier for the public to monitor government expenditures
                   and performance. From Pork to Performance makes the case that the success or failure of these
                   platforms hinges on the ability to translate information into engagement and action on the part of
                   elected officials, service providers, and citizens to close the feedback loop.

                   Capturing lessons learned from digital accountability initiatives in five sectors – education,
                   reconstruction, roads, municipal development, and tax collection – the report offer timely insights
                   and recommendations to deepen open government in the Philippines as a new administration
                   assumes office in 2016. The study’s broader contribution is to articulate a roadmap for Open
                   Government 3.0 to move from information to engagement and ensure that technology and
                   transparency initiatives generate tangible digital dividends for citizens.

                   The upcoming World Development Report 2017, Governance and Law, will emphasize that
                   governance should be assessed in terms of public sector capacity to deliver on goals that society
                   values. This raises the stakes for politicians and civil servants to make inroads in getting services to
                   work for citizens, as an essential barometer of government performance. From Pork to Performance
                   highlights how technology-enabled transparency can contribute to meet this challenge and
                   strengthen the accountability relationships between politicians, service providers and citizens.

           performed only marginally better, receiving a neutral rating on a recent Enterprise Survey of Corruption (SWS, 2015). Similarly, while the International
           Budget Partnership gave the Philippines relatively high marks on overall budget transparency, it rates the oversight of that budget by the Philippines
           legislature as quite weak (IBP, 2015).

           5. In February 1986, millions of Filipinos took to the streets in a non-violent People Power Revolution to depose the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos,
           Sr. A four-day series of mass demonstrations, the People Power Revolution was a sustained campaign of civil resistance that brought millions of Filipinos to
           Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA). On the surface, a new Philippines constitution mandating a single six-year presidential term and a succession of orderly
           political transitions signaled a return to normalcy; however, People Power was resurgent in 2001. Filipinos forced the resignation of President Joseph Estrada
           following a political corruption scandal and accused President Gloria Macapagpal-Arroyo’s administration of vote buying.

                   reform champions from the outgoing
                   Aquino administration. As the incoming
                   administration takes office, there is
                   untapped potential to increase the demand
                   for information on public resources and

                   environment for policymakers to use public

             politicians can also broadly converge with
             development objectives to deliver growth,
             jobs, or social protection benefits as a way to
             secure legitimacy or re-election. Even when
             politicians seek development progress, they
             may struggle to pursue these goals effectively
             because of the need to maintain the support
             of vested interests and pressures to: favor
             family members or close allies, lead fractious
             coalition governments, or navigate a difficult
             mix of fiscal problems and public discontent.

             challenges and the unpredictability of
             institutional change processes, there is
             increasing agreement that successful reform
             efforts require approaches that are problem-
             focused, iterative, and adaptive (Andrews,
             2013; World Bank, 2015d). Others have built
             on this idea, emphasizing the need for
             reform processes to be politically informed
             and locally led (Booth and Unsworth, 2014;
             Overseas Development Institute, 2015). Brian
             Levy (2014) similarly acknowledges that
             incremental reforms offer a path to progress
             that is pragmatic in breaking down change
             into manageable pieces that cumulatively
             can make a difference. There is also a growing
             awareness that for reforms to be successful,
             they must be locally anchored, built upon

                   poverty elasticity of growth of around -2 percent. The positive trend in poverty reduction is also confirmed by a higher growth of real income and lower
                   underemployment among poorer households compared to the rest of the population. Government transfers to the poor under the conditional cash transfer

             navigating the country’s political realities.
             The Philippines has already achieved notable
             gains in making its public finances “more
             comprehensive, consistent, and accessible” in
             line with the recommendations of a 2010 PEFA
             assessment (World Bank, 2010; World Bank,
             2016f). However, the country still falls short
             on the credibility of its budgets (i.e., realistic
             budgets implemented as intended) and
             accounting and reporting (i.e., expenditures
             are recorded and reconciled) – two areas in
             which the PEFA 2016 rated the Philippines as
             poorly performing (World Bank, 2016f).21

             to advance crosscutting PFM and good
             governance reforms that would strengthen
             budget credibility and expenditure
             tracking, implementation has fallen short
             of aspirations. Despite common recognition

             face of bureaucratic turf battles between and

             identify several flagship programs that would
             benefit from a digital accountability platform
             to support public expenditure tracking

             scale, recognizing that only some of these
             interventions were likely to succeed. This
             required alleviating bureaucratic unease with

             relevant government agencies. For this
             reason, ensuring the buy-in of the highest-
             level counterpart within the requesting
             government agency (e.g., Secretary, Governor)

               controlled corporations (GOCCs); (ii) those financed by the national government, but implemented by local governments; and (iii) those financed and
               implemented by local governments themselves. The 2013-2016 national budgets appeared to be financing over 10,000 projects.
               32. A broader question loomed regarding whether the national government should even be involved in implementing local roads projects, as opposed to
               merely financing them, given broader trends of devolution of responsibilities and resources for basic public services to LGUs. For example, the subsidiarity
               principle suggests that matters should be handled by the lowest level of competent administrative authority.

             45. The National Economic Development Authority proposed a government-spending envelope of ₱360.89 billion for post-disaster reconstruction assistance
             for Yolanda alone based upon its post-disaster damage and loss assessment completed within two months of the disaster. In its 2014 Comprehensive
             Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan, OPARR estimated a funding requirement of ₱163 billion (approximately US$4 billion) and encompasses 9,000 projects.
             Funding came from annual budget allocations in 2014-2016, which could be carried over across years. In late-2015, the government reported that one third of
             these projects were respectively completed and ongoing. As of June 2015, the government had released ₱84.70 billion for reconstruction, despite promises to
             complete reconstruction by 2017 (World Bank, 2015).

                   221. The long-term success of a digital
                   accountability platform in achieving its
                   objectives may be somewhat mediated by
                   the characteristics of the particular services
                   they seek to address. For example, the WDR
                   2016 argues that the capability of digital
                   technologies to change the behavior of
                   citizens and governments is largely shaped by
                   the answers to three critical questions about
                   the nature of the service in focus: do citizens
                   have the incentive to monitor; is the delivery
                   based on routine tasks; and can outcomes be
                   easily measured and attributed to specific
                   politicians or providers (World Bank, 2016a).
                   If the answers to these questions are yes,
                   the likelihood that a digital accountability
                   platform will be able to induce some
                   constructive action and response is higher.
