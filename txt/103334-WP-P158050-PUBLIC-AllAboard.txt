      The positive impact of the gradual lifting of controls
      over factors of production and trade flows since
      2011 reflects Myanmar’s strong potential for private
      sector led growth. The number of registered com-

      mitments have increased from US$ 3.6 billion in 2013
      to around US$ 8 billion in 2014. These have also been
      facilitated by the expansion of critical infrastructure in

      The efficiency of the business regulatory

      the ability of factor driven economies like Myanmar
      to sustainably promote private sector growth.
      This, together with public institutions, basic human

      macroeconomic stability tend to matter relatively more

      labor market efficiency and market size, which become
      relatively more important as countries transition from
      factor-based to efficiency and innovation driven

                                                  to GDP ratio as Myanmar today. Within 8 years,
                                                  credit to GDP increased fivefold and the number of

                                                  than doubled (figure 9). It is however important to note
                                                  that overly rapid expansion of credit can fuel a build

                                                  that credit expansion goes hand in hand with policies
                                                  that promote competition; avoid distortionary policies
                                                  such as subsidized credits to specific sectors or
                                                  enterprises; establish a modern legal and regulatory

                                                  the dependence on cash transactions. Each of these
                                                  factors could play a critical role ensuring that the
                                                  system expands in a stable and inclusive manner.

                                                  Based on this, the policy note proposes options

energy for all

The relative impact of increasing access to energy
on productivity, competitiveness and inclusive
growth in Myanmar could be very significant. Access
to affordable power is not only critical for the expansion
of productive sectors, but is also vital for the delivery
of public services in urban and rural areas. Electricity
consumption (kWh per capita) in fast growing countries
in the East Asia region has expanded rapidly in the past
40 years, whilst it has remained depressed in Myanmar,
falling to among the lowest levels in the world (figure
10). The experience from other countries demonstrates
how, with the right policies, access to energy could be
expanded quite rapidly within a relatively short period         Source: WDI and WB Staff Estimates

of time (figure 11).

For these reasons, access to energy policies have
taken center stage in Myanmar since 2011. Efforts
have focused on strengthening the institutional and
policy environment in the energy sector, which remains
somewhat fragmented, affecting policy coordination
and the speed of decision-making. Institutional reform
is likely to be critical for establishing a strong plat-
form for reforming this large sector, which is likely to
require US$ 2 billion per year over the next 15 years
for investment in power generation, transmission and
distribution. Public resources, including concessional
and donor support, will not be sufficient to foot such a
large bill. On the other hand, private investments in the
energy sector is likely to require, among other things,
energy pricing policies that are aligned with the finan-
cial viability of the sector.

The size of general government in Myanmar has
historically been small (figure 13) relative to the
country’s large service delivery needs. Recent efforts
to reprioritize government spending away from general
administration towards the delivery of health and edu-
cation services in particular have been complemented
by more public availability of information on the budget.
Tax collections have improved, though remain con-
strained by an official system for tax declarations that
is susceptible to corruption. This is compounded by
large undeclared natural resource rents that prevent the
people of Myanmar from reaping the benefits of these
vast national assets.

The policy note proposes to build on Myanmar’s
step-by-step progress over the past four years

efforts, much more would be needed to foster national
unity under a strong leadership that can provide a

preconditions to and determinants of Myanmar’s pro-
gress towards shared prosperity.

The ultimate success of policy reforms will also depend
on their degree of ownership in Myanmar. The people of
Myanmar should decide on the best course of action.
