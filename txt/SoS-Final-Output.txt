Junaid Ahmad,
SENIOR DIRECTOR, WATER GLOBAL PRACTICE, THE WORLD BANK GROUP




Dear Colleagues,

Two years ago, 120 officials and professionals responsible for water and wastewater services in the Danube region
met in Vienna to discuss the sector’s situation and launch the Danube Water Program. Back then, as today, a priority
was to exchange experience and knowledge about regional trends, challenges, and opportunities in ensuring smart
policies, strong utilities, and sustainable services for all. In many ways, this mirrors the World Bank’s own approach to
reduce extreme poverty and increase shared prosperity, our institution’s overarching goals.

In the Water Global Practice, we not only focus on access to services but also on sustainability, and we understand
institutions and policies matter. We work with our clients and the best analysis and knowledge available to inform,
design, and implement the policies and programs that will bring sustainable water and wastewater services for all,
especially the poor and less privileged. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to introduce this regional State of the
Sector review, which I hope will provide a further basis for such important exchanges to continue to create solutions
for the people in this region.

I would like to warmly thank the Ministry of Finance of Austria, whose financial support has been essential to the
success of the Danube Water Program, and in particular the realization of this study; the International Association of
Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area, which has been a strong partner of the World Bank
under the Danube Water Program; and most importantly, all of you, individuals and institutions, who have contributed
information, knowledge, experience, and time to the Program’s activities and this report, in particular. I hope you will
find it worth your effort. I look forward to continuing this partnership to ensure sustainable services for all in the
Danube region.

The establishment of the Danube Water Program involved the coming together of two very different organizations
– IAWD on the one side – an association of water utilities in the Danube River catchment – and the World Bank on
the other. The marriage of these two very different organizations is reflected in the management of the program –
IAWD is responsible for capacity building, particularly directly for utilities, and the World Bank is primarily responsible
for the policy, analytical, and governance aspects of the program. Despite the divisions that exist, the program
has been managed in a shared manner, focused on synergy between the expertise and networks of the respective
organizations.

This State of the Sector study is a product of that marriage, where the Bank has taken the lead in bringing its
enormous worldwide experience and analytical skills to produce a first-of-its-kind regional study of water services.
IAWD is pleased to have played a supportive role in the data collection and providing some informational inputs, but is
even more anxious to play a strong role in seeing that this study stimulates actions to improve services.

The World Bank team has done a commendable job in analyzing and presenting information about the sector. It is
our expectation that this study will facilitate and support high-level debate on key policy questions (i.e., tariff setting,
getting services to the poor), but also should trigger discussion down to the utility level on how best to organize and
manage water utilities to achieve efficient and effective services. The people of the Danube region have a right to
clean, safe, and efficient water and sanitation services, and this study examines where deficits exist in achieving that
goal.

The study, and analytical work behind it, is a necessary building block to improving water services. IAWD looks
forward to taking an active role in understanding and using the information presented in this highly informative study.
We will also continue to work with the community of people active in the water sector to take the messages and
lessons from this study to jointly work on ensuring smart policies, strong utilities, and sustainable services in the
Danube region.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report analyzes the progress and challenges of 16 countries in the Danube watershed in delivering sustainable
water and wastewater services to all, while meeting the European Union environmental acquis communautaire. After
putting the services that are being delivered into context, the report analyzes the organization of services in the region
and the level of access to services, that is, how well countries are doing in terms of providing access to water and
wastewater services for the entire population. It then looks at the performance of the sector, including the quality
of services provided and customer satisfaction with it. It also draws a picture of the efficiency of services, including
whether they reflect accepted good practices. Finally, it analyzes the financing of services, looking at whether the
financing of operation, maintenance, and investments is secured and affordable. The report is complemented by 16
country notes available at SoS.danubis.org.

The report draws largely from existing public data sources at the national and regional level, and consolidates them
into a coherent, regional narrative and analysis. The methods of analysis include horizontal comparisons among
countries at a given point in time and trends within the countries or the region over a given period of time. Given
shortcomings in the availability and comparability of data across 16 countries, the report seeks to encourage and
inform a policy dialogue around sector challenges rather than provide a definitive set of policy recommendations.




Context
Most of the Danube catchment area has shared a common trajectory over the last 30 years, and the development
of water and sanitation services has broadly followed a similar process of transformation—one driven mainly by
two major politico-economic processes—the fall of communism and European Union (EU) integration. While in the
post-socialist period most countries saw strong decentralization and significant involvement of the private sector, EU
integration has led to a need for enhanced regulation of municipal services, introduction of the cost recovery principle,
a drive toward structural change, and increased efficiency and sustainability in service provision.

With the embracement of market-based economic principles and open borders, countries have achieved sizable
growth in their per capita GDP, although with variations among and within countries, but about 2.3 million people
within the Danube region live on less than $2.50 a day (purchasing power parity [PPP]), which is the regional level for
extreme poverty. The poor disproportionately reside in rural areas, and there are 10 million to 12 million Roma, the
largest and poorest minority group in the region.

The Danube River basin is relatively rich in water resources, and although this wealth is unevenly spread among
different parts of the basin, only one country—the Czech Republic—can be qualified as water stressed, with a level
below 1,700 cubic meters of renewable water resources per capita per year. Groundwater is the dominant source
of water supply in the region, producing around 72 percent of the drinking water. Water management in the Danube
basin is driven by the principles of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), under the auspices of the International
Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR).




Organization of Services
The organization of services is characterized mainly by the decentralization of service provision and ownership at
the municipal level, while private sector involvement remains largely limited. Driven by the EU accession process,
some of the recent trends include the aggregation and corporatization of service providers and the establishment of
independent regulatory authorities.

About three-quarters of the region’s population receive public service from one of the more than 10,000 formal utility
providers in the region, leaving one-quarter to rely on informal providers or self-provision, mostly in rural areas. The
size of the formal providers varies greatly, with private providers serving, on average, the largest customer base,

followed by regional, municipal, and small providers. In an effort to benefit from economies of scale and facilitate the
absorption of EU funds, several countries are promoting the aggregation of small providers into regional ones. Water
and wastewater service management are often provided by the same utility company, except in a few countries where
they are separate entities.

Sector policy formulation remains the responsibility of central government authorities, whereby the EU agenda
and transposition of the EU water directives, such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the Drinking
Water Directive, are a key force driving changes in the sector. In the last 15 years, there has been a trend toward
greater independent regulation of water and wastewater service provision, and nine countries have such a regulatory
authority. All nine regulators play a formal role in tariff setting and approval, often alongside the local governments,
but only three are specific to the water sector, and they vary greatly in their independence. Common to all is the
difficulty of regulating a large number of public, municipally owned utilities that are largely driven by local priorities
rather than financial profits.

Except in a few countries, data and information about the sector and its service providers are still relatively scattered,
and are sometimes inconsistent or of limited quality. Efforts to track utility performance and benchmark it against
their peers and international good practices are increasing, but the information is seldom made publicly available.




Access to Services
Access to water and sanitation services in the region is high compared to the rest of the world. The collection and
treatment of wastewater, however, generally lags behind the high level of access to piped water and private flush
toilets, especially with regard to EU standards. Household coverage with piped water has remained consistently high
since the beginning of the millennium, with 83 percent of the population having piped water in their dwellings, leaving
17 percent, or almost 22.5 million people, without this service, mostly in rural areas. The Roma generally have lower
access to water and sanitation than the rest of the population. Almost 80 percent of the population of the Danube
watershed report having a flush toilet in their homes, yet only 66 percent are connected to public sewer networks, with
the greatest differences discernable in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Montenegro. Less than 20 percent of
the poorest and less than half of the bottom 40 percent of the population have access to a private toilet in Bulgaria,
Moldova, and Romania. Wastewater treatment coverage has shown significant improvement in recent years, but still
remains the least developed sector service in the region.




Performance of Services
The overall performance of water and wastewater services in terms of their quality and efficiency varies widely
within the region, and is generally below international good practices. However, there have been positive trends in a
number of dimensions. In many of the countries, water service is generally continuous, and drinking water reaches
national quality standards. Unsurprisingly, customer satisfaction is highest where service quality is highest, but overall
customer protection mechanisms are somewhat underdeveloped, especially in countries without regulatory agencies.
The level of customer metering has steadily increased to nearly universal coverage in many countries, bringing down
individual consumption of water to 100 liters per capita per day to 120 liters per capita per day in most countries,
which is in line with EU standards. Despite overall improvements and convergence, the efficiency of utilities in most
countries is below international standards, and nonrevenue water and overstaffing of utilities continue to present
significant challenges.

The report uses a proposed Water Utility Performance Index (WUPI) to evaluate the overall performance of utilities.
The WUPI analyses show that performance varies widely within the region and each country, but generally increases
with the level of economic development of the country. Overall, the performance of water utilities has improved over
the last 10 years, with the ones that display higher performance also generally charging higher tariffs. An econometric
analysis shows that while larger utilities tend to perform better than smaller utilities, it is less clear that merging utility
companies (aggregation or regionalization) always has a positive effect on overall performance.

Financing of Services
Increasing costs have driven increases in tariffs throughout the region to the point where services might become
unaffordable for low-income customers in some countries; yet the region is far from implementing the Water
Framework Directive’s principle of cost recovery. Overall, the level of sector financing from tariffs, taxes, and transfers
varies widely among countries, with EU countries showing the highest per capita financing. The structure of financing
also shows variations from country to country, but investments are in general supported by public funds and external
transfers, while operational expenditures are mostly covered by utilities’ own tariff revenue. Despite the widespread
adoption of the cost recovery principle in national legislation, only two countries—Austria and Moldova—the richest
and the poorest, respectively—rely mostly on tariffs to finance the sector. Few countries have developed a dedicated
water sector financing mechanism providing predictable funding, and the EU Funds now represent the largest share of
external financing in the region.

On average, the sector directs about half of overall expenditures toward operating and maintaining infrastructure and
half toward renewing or expanding it. Water and wastewater investments in the region are around €3.5 billion per year,
significantly below the €5.5 billion estimated by the respective countries as needed to achieve EU and national targets.
The costs of providing services vary among countries, but overall have grown significantly over the last 20 years,
leading to parallel increases in tariffs. Both operation and maintenance costs and residential tariffs usually follow the
level of economic development of countries, with costs and tariffs highest in EU member states.

Despite this increase in tariffs, current levels are still affordable to the average consumer, and estimates of the
expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent show that affordability constraints are prevalent only in Ukraine. Several
countries have defined thresholds to identify affordability constraints of below 5 percent of income, and Croatia,
Hungary, FYR Macedonia, Slovenia, and Ukraine report having formal subsidy schemes to ensure affordability for low-
income earners.




Conclusions
The report concludes that the water and wastewater sector has been strongly impacted by the region’s trajectory
over the last 30 years, going from a socialist period through a transition phase to the EU accession process. The
EU accession process serves as a motivator to improve access, quality, and efficiency of water services, and
assessments show that the status of the countries in terms of EU accession is positively related to the level of
development of wastewater services. The availability of data is limited, including, surprisingly, in more advanced
countries such as Austria and Slovenia. Further analytical work is necessary to understand some aspects of service
provision in the region, such as the situation of the population without access to public supply, the drivers of utility
performance, the impact of ongoing institutional reforms, the ways to address long-term affordability of services, and
how to best manage wastewater treatment from a financial and institutional standpoint.

Regardless of the data and information gaps, some clear challenges emerge as countries seek to provide sustainable
services to their citizens while meeting the EU environmental acquis communautaire, including the following: (a) while
service provision remains a local government responsibility in most countries, policy trends around EU accession
tend to subject it to increased central government regulatory and institutional oversight, creating the need for
clear accountability mechanisms; (b) despite the overall high level of access to services in the region and focus on
wastewater collection and management, there are still 22.5 million people without access to piped water on their
premises and 28 million without flush toilets; (c) service providers’ performance has improved in the last 15 years
but continues to be below international standards, threatening the long-term sustainability of ongoing investment
programs; (d) the sector’s overall financing framework does not guarantee universal, high-quality service in the long
run, and while the cost recovery principle has been widely adopted, many utility companies are barely recovering their
operating costs from tariffs, and invest too little into asset management and development.

Despite these challenges, the region can still build on a few important opportunities. Recent history has shown that
the water and wastewater sector is open to change, and if those governments, considering reforms in around a third
of the countries, base their efforts on solid analyses, they can continue to build positive momentum for the sector. EU

integration continues to present a tremendous policy and financing opportunity for many countries; the widespread
adoption of formal regulatory frameworks and utility corporatization reforms can help promote greater accountability;
and despite managerial shortcomings, the sector has a strong technical workforce. The report also shows the need
for further work to be done in response to some of the challenges identified and where the current information
available was too limited to draw clear conclusions. Examples for further analyses include developing models to
provide sustainable services in areas beyond the reach of public utilities, addressing potential affordability challenges
through well-targeted subsidies, and/or improving the financing and institutional framework for wastewater
treatments in those countries with no or limited prior experience.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.	 Governments and water professionals in the Danube region are facing a combined challenge of meeting their
citizens’ demand for universal, good quality, efficient, and financially sound, or in a word, sustainable, services,
while catching up to the environmental requirements of the European Union acquis communautaire. As this report
shows, much work remains to be done to provide sustainable water and wastewater services for all in the Danube
Region, in particular among recent or future EU members. Millions in the region do not have in-house piped water
or a flush toilet, with the bottom 40 percent and poor, rural, and minorities overrepresented. Some service providers
still struggle to provide continuous, potable water to their clients; low tariffs and inefficient utility practices create
challenges for the proper operation and maintenance of the existing infrastructure. At the same time, to satisfy
the acquis communautaire, the Water Framework Directive is being transposed into the legal and institutional
frameworks of the countries of the region, and large investments for the upgrading or development of water and
wastewater assets are being made, which create further technical and financial burdens on service providers.
Governments around the region are therefore revisiting the way services are being delivered and financed, and this
State of the Sector review seeks to document and inform the process by showing how policies focused not only on EU
compliance, but broadly on providing universal, high-quality, efficient, and financially sound services to all, including
the poor, will help meet the spirit of the EU acquis communautaire and citizens’ expectations in a sustainable and
equitable manner.

2.	 The State of the Sector report analyzes the region’s progress and challenges in delivering sustainable water
and wastewater services for all. The Word Bank’s twin goals are to eliminate extreme poverty and increase shared
prosperity, and water services play an important role in achieving those goals. The report therefore focuses particular
attention on understanding the situation of the bottom 40 percent of the population (with respect to income), and
on the extreme poor living on less than $2.50 a day PPP. While some of the information is available only for services
provided by utility companies, the report aims to cover the entire population, including rural areas. The review covers
161 countries contained within or bordering on the Danube watershed (Figure 1), which represent a great diversity of
socioeconomic, development, and geographic realities, but share a joint resource, the Danube; an intertwined history;


1	 A small part of the national territory of Germany, Italy, and Switzerland is also within the Danube Watershed. Those three countries were not covered,
however, because they are not traditionally seen as part of the Danube region, and the reality and organization of their water services is of limited direct
relevance to countries of the watershed.

and a common trajectory toward European integration. Given the relevance of the EU accession process for water
services, the report presents many of the results separately for EU members, EU candidates (including potential
candidates), and Non-EU countries. The report is a flagship product of the World Bank / International Association of
Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD) Danube Water Program (www.danube-water-
program.org), which provides parallel support to many of the region’s stakeholders to achieve smart policies, strong
utilities, and sustainable services.

3.	 The analysis assumes that the delivery of sustainable services depends on four main dimensions: access
infrastructure to be in place, service providers to operate and maintain it, sector governance that helps those
thrive, and the proper financing mechanisms to maintain and expand services in the long term. Before describing
those four dimensions, Chapter II highlights the context in which services are being delivered; Chapter III provides an
overview of the organization and governance of the sector in the various countries; Chapter IV describes the level of
access to water and wastewater services in the region; Chapter V deals with the performance of service providers,
in terms of service quality, efficiency, and overall performance; Chapter VI discusses the financing of services;
and Chapter VII presents conclusions. A number of boxes provide additional information on good practices or key
concepts. The report includes two annexes; the first (Country Pages) offers a comprehensive, country-by-country list
of indicators; and the second (Methodological Notes) provides further methodological details on the main sections
of the report. The report also includes a comprehensive list of sources for all data and information used throughout
the document. The report is complemented by 16 Country Notes, which provide greater details on the State of the
Sector in each country. All material are also available online on the sos.danubis.org website. Further information is
also available on the www.DANUBIS.org water platform, an online repository of resources for and about water and
sanitation services in the Danube region.

4.	 This report and the State of the Sector review is the result of a team effort of more than 30 contributors spread
over the entire Danube watershed and beyond, and builds largely on publicly available data and the collective
work of many institutions in the region, including line ministries, regulatory authorities, and national waterwork
associations. The report draws largely from existing, public data sources at the national and regional levels, although
it represents the first time those various sources have been consolidated into a coherent, regional narrative and
analysis. In-country data (referred to as “SoS data collection”) were collected by a team of local consultants in each
of the countries covered by the report, and validated with key stakeholders in each country. To keep the main text
readable, many of the references have been moved to the end of this report, along with some of the methodological
descriptions. The national data were complemented by publicly available household survey data in each country, as
well as regional resources such as the EU’s EUROSTAT, the FAO’s AQUASTAT, the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators, the European Environment Agency’s (EEA’s) WISE, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program, and the
IBNET / DANUBIS database. While preparing the report, assumptions were made, and although an extensive validation
effort was undertaken, it is to be expected that some of the data and information provided could be questioned. The
report’s preparation has also shown that some countries have much better information than others, and sometimes
official statistics do not reconcile fully with the reality that sector professionals know. The team therefore welcomes
comments and corrections.

5.	 While great care has been taken to ensure consistency and accuracy of the data and information, the main
aim of the report is to support an informed dialogue around the sector’s challenges rather than provide a
definitive set of policy recommendations. This report, by itself, will not solve the challenges highlighted in the last
chapter. By design, the report is limited to an analysis of the current situation, and does not include formal policy
recommendations for the region or the individual countries. National stakeholders are best placed to discuss whether
and how to address them, drawing on the analysis provided in this report, and the opportunities and good practices
described throughout the document and in its supporting Country Notes. It is the authors’ hope, however, that this
report will provide a solid information and analytical basis to inform the necessary dialogue, despite any limits and
shortcomings in the data available and the resulting conclusions. The authors will gladly provide any necessary
support to this process, and hope that the next edition of this State of the Sector Review will be able to build on a
much stronger database and document progress in addressing the sector’s main challenges.

II. CONTEXT FOR SERVICES
6.	 Water services are strongly dependent on the political, socioeconomic, and natural context in which they are
delivered. Following the collapse of socialist systems, most countries of the Danube region have shared a common
political and economic development transition path over the last few decades, with the European Union (EU)
integration agenda an overarching aim in almost all countries of the region. Major differences among countries still
remain, but those differences are gradually diminishing, and a convergence toward EU standards is occurring. The
region is also generally well endowed with water resources, despite the potential impact of climate change.

7.	 This chapter looks at the political-economic-social context in which water service provision in the region is
taking place; it describes the historical perspective and development, analyzes the socioeconomic situation in
different countries, and describes the richness and diversity of water resources, with consideration for expected
climatic changes and their potential impact.

8.	 The data and information used in this chapter come mainly from World-Bank elaborated/collected data,
including World Development Indicators, but also include publicly available United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), European Commission (EC), and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) publications and databases.
The information is complemented by a country-by-country data collection effort (referenced as “SoS data
collection” in the text) that relies primarily on country-level public sources, and is fully referenced in the country
pages at the end of this report.




A.	Historical Perspective
9.	 Provision of water supply and sanitation services and their development in the region have mirrored the
dramatic political and economic changes in the region since 1990, during which the region has moved from
a centrally planned, state-run, socialist economy to a western-style democratic, capitalist system and EU
membership. The largest part of the Danube catchment area belongs geopolitically to South-East Europe, and in
general has shared the same destiny over the last 50 years. Countries that are the subject of this report, from the
Czech Republic to Albania (with a partial exemption of post-Yugoslavia countries), have during the second half of 20th
century belonged to the so-called socialist block of European countries, and their economic and political situation
and development, regardless of major differences among them, has broadly followed a similar path. Development
of and issues in water and sanitation services provision in those countries, being part of overall municipal service
provision, have also followed a broadly similar process of transformation that can therefore be viewed as a region-
wide development process.

10.	 During the last 25 years, the sector’s development and changes were driven by two major political and
economic processes. The first one was the fall of communism and disintegration of the Eastern European socialist
block in 1990, which led to change in the political and economic system in those countries. The second was the
expansion of the EU toward Eastern Europe, bringing gradual alignment with the EU acquis communautaire in
candidate and new member countries. Both of those processes have also seriously impacted water service provision
and environmental standards in the region, leading to changes in service standards, financing, and governance. While
the current sector organization is described in detail in Chapter III, the following provides a brief historical synthesis of
the main stages of public service delivery in the region in the recent past.

   XXSocialist  system period (until 1990). This period was characterized by rapid industrialization, a lack of
      environmental sensitivity, and strong urbanization. The necessarily rapid development of the water supply
      infrastructure was not followed by adequate wastewater and wastewater treatment provision, causing major
      deterioration of natural water quality in receiving waters. Property, service provision, and management of utility
      providers was mostly in the hands of the central government (with some differences in the Former Yugoslavia).
      The overall water sector development and pricing approach focused on delivery of affordable service for all,
      at the expense of economic efficiency, quality, and sustainability of service provision, and lack of demand
      management combined with inefficient use of resources.

B.	Socioeconomic Situation
11.	 With the change of political systems, as outlined in the previous section, Eastern European countries
witnessed dramatic economic and demographic transitions. Having been closed to the movement of goods,
services, people, and ideas under socialist rule, the opening of borders following the disuniting of the Former Soviet
Union enabled people and money to move toward areas of economic opportunity, with resulting changes in GDP per
capita and population at subnational levels.

12.	 The embracement of market-based economic principles and open borders generated sizable growth in the per
capita GDP of several countries, with signs that economies farther away from markets are lagging behind. As can
be discerned from Figure 3, above, differences in GDP per capita (current 2013 US$ purchasing power parity [PPP]) are
still significant across the countries within the Danube watershed, with Moldova (at US$4,669) being the poorest, with
one-tenth the per capita GDP of the richest country, Austria (at US$44,149).

13.	 Growth in GDP per capita was heterogeneous within countries. With respect to income, the bottom 40 percent
of the population in Albania, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia experienced lower GDP growth per
capita compared to their respective country average, and, with the exception of Montenegro, those incomes even
declined between 1 and 2 percent annually from 2005 to 2010, as shown in Figure 4. In contrast, households among
the bottom 40 percent in Slovakia and Romania enjoyed annual increases in their incomes to more than double and
triple the average, although transfers are estimated to explain almost 90 percent of the increase in Romania (Bussolo
and Lopez-Calva, Shared Prosperity: Paving the way in Europe and Central Asia 2014, 37). While some countries
register higher growth in incomes among their bottom 40 percent, most countries still have a long way to go to close
the income gap between this group and the top 60 percent. The share of the bottom 40 percent in Bulgaria, Hungary,
FYR Macedonia, Moldova, and Romania was less than 20 percent of total income, closely followed by Albania, Croatia,
Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia, with about 22 percent (Bussolo and Lopez-Calva, Shared Prosperity: Paving the way
in Europe and Central Asia 2014, 19). Even in Austria, the bottom 40 percent holds only about 23 percent of the total
income (authors’ computation using EUSILC data from 2012).

14.	 About 2.3 million people within the Danube water region live of less than $2.50 a day (PPP), the regional level
for measuring extreme poverty. On average and excluding Austria, this means that about 1.8 percent of the total
population in the area is extremely poor. As Figure 5 shows, by far the largest incidence of poverty is in Romania,
which, with a population of 20 million, is the second-largest country after Ukraine. However, in terms of percentage of
poor, FYR Macedonia2 outranks the others, closely followed by Moldova, Kosovo, and Albania.

15.	 The Roma community, with 10 million to 12 million members (EC 2015), is the largest and poorest minority
in Europe and in the region. Although the precise number of Roma is highly debated, the largest populations reside
in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, though Roma also live in Albania, Austria, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, and Serbia, among the countries within the Danube
watershed. Compared to non-Roma, Roma have the worst socioeconomic indicators in almost all areas3, including
health, education, work participation, salaries, and living conditions, which is why their integration and improvement
has become an urgent focus of the poverty agenda of the European Commission, the World Bank, and other
development partners. To demonstrate an example from a household survey4 conducted in 2012 in these countries,

2	 Macedonia’s poverty estimates are reported for 2008, representing the last Household Budget Survey for which poverty was assessed (World Bank’s
Poverty and Inequality Database: Europe & Central Asia 2015).

4	 In 2011, the UNDP, the World Bank, and the European Commission conducted a sample survey of the largest Roma agglomerations in these
countries, with the purpose of enumerating the socioeconomic situation of Roma and non-Roma households (20,018 Roma and 9,782 non-Roma living
nearby). Reported statistics are significant only at the settlement level, not at the national level.

16.	 In Albania, FYR Macedonia, Kosovo, and Slovakia, the poor are distributed between rural and urban areas
in equal proportion to the population, but in all other countries the poor disproportionately reside in rural areas.
As shown in Figure 7, 86 percent of the poorest in Moldova reside in rural areas, although only 55 percent of the
total population are rural based. In Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine, at more than 70 percent, the share of the
rural poor significantly exceeds the respective share of the rural population. In some countries—notably Serbia,
Slovakia, and Ukraine—the share of the rural poor increased between 2002 and 2008 (Sulla 2011). A growing share
of rural poor poses a challenge to modern infrastructure services, because investments lack the economies of
scale to be provided cost-effectively, and the population is unlikely to be able to afford the maintenance of modern
infrastructure services. The average urbanization rate of countries within the Danube watershed is 63 percent,
which is slightly higher than the country average of Central Europe and the Baltics (62 percent), but significantly
lower than the rate of EU countries, at 74 percent.5 Overall, urbanization has been stagnant in Danube countries
since the early 1990s.

17.	 The combination of low natural population growth and outward migration has resulted in a decline in
the total number of people living in countries within the Danube watershed. From 1961 to 1989, countries
experienced a joint annual increase in the population of 0.8 percent, which declined from 1990 onwards at a rate of
0.4 percent per year. Lower fertility rates and an aging population in Europe—East and West—will make Europe the
only continent in the world in which the population is expected to decline over the next 40 years (Bussolo, Koettl
and Sinnott, forthcoming). However, countries within the Danube watershed are already experiencing a population
decline triggered by, in addition to a natural decrease, an outward migration following the opening of borders to the
West (Figure 8). Although it is mostly rural areas that are depopulating, some of the urban areas have also declined
in population numbers, especially those located remotely and isolated from global markets and transport corridors.
This has resulted in several cities facing an oversized infrastructure that lacks economies of scale and is costly to
maintain and upgrade.

C.	Administrative Organization
18.	 Administrative arrangements in all countries of the region show similarities, but with country specifics
that often have their origin in historical developments. All countries in the region are centralized countries (with
the exceptions of Austria, which is a federal country, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has a specific two-entity
structure), and key decision-making powers are often centralized at the highest level. Most of the countries in the
region have three levels of governance—national, regional (county), and municipal. However, three countries (FYR
Macedonia, Montenegro, and Slovenia) have only two (national and municipal) levels, and three countries (Austria,
Slovakia and Ukraine) have an additional fourth level of government between the regional and municipal levels.

19.	 In most cases, the national government retains overall policy-making authority over public services,
but service delivery responsibility is delegated to local levels of governance. The most common distribution
of responsibilities in the region is that the national level has the responsibility for defining and adopting the
sector legal framework, and responsibility for management of the national budget and resources (usually
implemented through a number of designated line ministries), while lower administrative levels such as regions
and municipalities are usually given authorities related to local development, including provision of municipal utility
services (with partial exception in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Kosovo, where the local utility service provision sector is
partially owned by the central state).

20.	 There are large differences among countries in terms of fragmentation of municipal governance. The number
of municipalities, as the lowest level of governance in individual countries, varies considerably among countries,
and ranges from 11,625 in Ukraine to only 23 in Montenegro. Central European countries such as Austria, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, with long traditions of local self-government, all have a large number of small
municipalities, while relatively new countries where municipal borders were drawn recently (such as Kosovo and
Montenegro) have a smaller number of relatively larger municipalities. A comparison of the number of municipalities
among different countries (Figure 9) shows that they not only differ greatly in territorial size (average size of
municipality ranges from 12 square kilometers [km2] in the Czech Republic to 611 km2 in Montenegro), but also in
population size (average population of municipalities ranges from 1,681 in Czech Republic to 48,000 in Kosovo).

are covered in this report (Germany, Italy, and Switzerland are excluded because they are not typically associated with
the Danube region countries, as such). Due to its large breadth from west to east, and diverse landscape, the Danube
River basin evidences great differences in water resources and climate. The Danube connects with 27 large and over
300 small tributaries from its spring in the Black Forest in Germany to the Black Sea in Romania, and as such is the
largest water basin in the EU. The region is rich with renewable water resources, but there are still major differences in
availability of these resources in different parts of the region, ranging from more than 24,000 m3 per capita per year in
Croatia, to 1,250 m3 per capita per year in the Czech Republic (Figure 10).

22.	 Only one country in the basin, the Czech Republic, can be qualified as water stressed. The most widely used
measure for scarcity of water is the Falkenmark indicator or Water Stress Index (Falkenmark, Lundqvist and Widstrand
2009), which uses 1,700 m3 of renewable water resources per capita per year as the threshold (based on estimates
of water requirements in the household and in the agricultural, industrial, and energy sectors). Measured by that
indicator, of all the countries in the Danube River basin, only the Czech Republic can be qualified as water stressed.
At the same time, no country in the Danube River basin falls below the “water scarcity” threshold of 1,000m3, again
emphasizing the solid availability of renewable water resources in the region compared to other parts of the world.

23.	 Rainfall in the region is only moderately seasonal and dependent on predominant climatic conditions. The
regional rainfall distribution shows a strong influence of different climates, which change from Continental to
Mediterranean depending on the part of the basin, and range from less than 300 millimeters (mm) to more than 1,400
mm per year. This has a major impact on the variation of renewable freshwater resources6, as seen in Figure 11.

24.	 The impact of climate change in the region is visible through changes in the hydrological cycle, leading to an
increasing occurrence of extreme weather conditions, from droughts to high waters and rainfalls. Since the Danube
region has mostly moderate climate, with a relatively balanced variation of rainfalls, the adverse effects of climate
change have so far been only moderate. Based on findings of the Climate Change Adaptation study (LMU 2012) for
the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR), the main impacts on water-related


6	 Renewable internal freshwater resources flows refer to internal river flows and groundwater from rainfall in the country, and are defined as renewable
water resources generated from endogenous precipitation at the territory of individual country, as opposed to renewable freshwater resources that
include all transboundary freshwater flows in the country.

sectors are triggered by temperature and precipitation changes, including (a) an increase in air temperature with a
gradient from northwest to southeast, particularly in summer in the southeastern Danube region; (b) overall small
annual precipitation changes for the whole basin on average, but major seasonal changes in the Danube River basin;
(c) changes in the seasonal runoff pattern, triggered by changes in rainfall distribution and reduced snow storage;
(d) the likelihood that droughts, low flow situations, and water scarcity will become longer, more intense, and more
frequent; and (e) an increase in water temperature and increased pressures on water quality (Figure 12 and Figure 13).

25.	 Potential damage to water sector provision due to climate change ranges from damage to infrastructure to
revenue loss. Due to their dependence on regular, expected rainfalls, and temperature-dependent consumption,
water services are sensitive to climate change, droughts, and lower groundwater tables, and potential drinking water
shortages are sensitive to extreme rainfalls and floods. Resulting from the above-mentioned negative impacts of
climate change, the major vulnerabilities of water supply and sanitation (WSS) are expected to include (a) drinking
water shortages due to droughts and groundwater table lowering, (b) water quality issues due to extreme droughts or
rainfalls, and (c) damage to residential and industrial WSS infrastructure due to extreme weather events. The damage
assessment following the May 2014 floods in the Sava catchment area illustrates the destructive force of floods on
man-made infrastructure, but also the relative resilience of water supply and sanitation infrastructure, since most of
the systems were back in operation in few weeks’ time.

27.	 The quality of surface waters has remained the focus of activities over the last few decades, and while
improvement is visible, overall good water status has not yet been achieved in significant parts of the basin.
Industrial activities and large population concentrations are responsible for the relatively high level of organic
pollutants and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) discharged into the waters of Danube River basin. The loads of
organic pollution in surface waters are still high in some parts of Danube and in most of the Danube River tributaries
(results for the whole Danube River basin area are presented in Figure 14 and Figure 15). This is the consequence
of still considerable discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated wastewater from municipal, industrial, and
agricultural sources, in particular in the lower part of the basin, where there are new or non-EU countries located. The
analysis prepared under the ICPDR shows that in the last two decades, there have been considerable improvements
in water quality in the Danube River basin. This could be attributed to the high level of investments in wastewater
treatment, made mostly under the EU accession agenda, and a significant decline of industry and agricultural
activities in the post-socialist period. However, the main nutrient pollution sources in the Danube River basin remain
agriculture (50 percent), followed by municipal wastewater (25 percent) and industry (25 percent) (ICPDR 2009).

groundwater are well represented as sources of water supply, groundwater is the dominant source of drinking water

29.	 Industrial and domestic use of renewable freshwater resources dominates in the region, even after the decline
in industrial output during the last 20 years. Water withdrawn for human use is shared among domestic, industrial,
and agricultural use. A comparison of different categories gives a clear indication of the form of economy that exists
in individual countries (Figure 17), with mostly agricultural use in Albania, mostly industrial use in Austria, and mostly
domestic use in countries that have developed neither industrial nor agricultural use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia).

30.	 Water management in the Danube River basin is driven by the principles of the EU Water Framework
Directive (WFD) under the auspices of the ICPDR. The ICPDR was established in 1998 on the basis of the Danube
River Protection Convention, the major legal instrument for cooperation and transboundary water management
in the Danube River basin, and the platform for implementation of all transboundary aspects of the EU WFD.
With support from the ICPDR, the 19 countries of the Danube watershed have elaborated a Danube River Basin
Management Plan in conformity with the WFD. The plan was first adopted in 2009 and is being updated jointly by
all countries in 2015, in conformity with the WFD’s six-year timeline. Its purpose is to establish a framework for the
protection and enhancement of the status of inland surface and groundwater, and to ensure sustainable use of
water resources, and aims to ensure that all waters meet “good status,” which is the ultimate objective of the WFD.

III.	ORGANIZATION OF SERVICES
31.	 The organization of water services in the Danube region is similar in its structure and distribution of
responsibilities to other regions of Europe, but with some specifics that originate from the region’s historic
background and development. Decentralization of service provision and ownership at the municipal level is
currently the dominant form of organization, while private sector involvement remains largely limited. Driven by the
EU accession process, some of the recent trends include the aggregation and corporatization of service providers
and the establishment of independent regulatory authorities.

32.	 This chapter reviews how the main functions necessary in a well-structured water services sector—service
provision, policy making, regulation, resource management, and sector monitoring—are distributed across national
and local governments in the different countries. The chapter describes the size, ownership, and management
of service providers; looks at policy-making responsibilities and at the relevance of the EU water directive for
organization and service provision; and presents recent trends in sector regulation and monitoring.

33.	 The data and information in this chapter are largely derived from publicly available sources at the country and
EU levels, and from a country-by-country review done by local experts of the sector’s governance and policies,
which is referred to as “SoS data collection” in the text. Numerical values are referenced in full in the Country Pages
at the end of the report.




A.	Service Provision
34.	 About three-quarters of the region’s population receive public service from a formal utility,7 and one-quarter,
representing households and communities, rely on self-provision or informal providers. Figure 18 shows the
main types of water service providers in the region and the share of the region’s population they provide service
to. Larger, regional utilities (whether public or private) already serve close to half the population. As the following
paragraphs show, the share is expected to continue to grow, given the ongoing push toward regionalization of
smaller, municipal or village-level service providers, which currently still serve about one-third of the population.
Despite a few high-profile recent re-municipalization cases, such as in Budapest, privately managed utility
companies continue to serve about 10 percent of the region’s population, mostly in larger cities (Bucharest, Sofia)
and in selected countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia).

35.	 There are over 10,000 formal service providers in the region, with wide variation in size of population
served among and within countries, but just 700 serve more than half of the connected population. Austria has
the largest number of, and the smallest utilities in, the region, serving, on average, only about 1,400 customers,
followed by the Czech Republic, where water utilities serve, on average, a little over 4,000 customers. The small
size is expected given the large number of service providers (and municipalities; see Chapter II, Section C) in the
Austrian and Czech water sectors. In contrast, Slovakia, where only 17 water companies provide services to over 6
million people, has the largest average size of utilities. The water sector reorganization process that Hungary and
Kosovo went through in recent years also resulted in few large companies serving, on average, around 200,000
people; and in Bulgaria, where decentralization never fully took place, the average size remains relatively larger at
130,000. The average size of utilities in the remaining countries ranges from about 20,000 to 50,000 customers
(Figure 19).




7	 In this report and throughout the Danube region, the term “public supply” is used to indicate the provision of public services by a formal utility service
provider, as opposed to informal, locally managed cooperatives or self-provision. The use of the term public does not refer to the ownership of the utility
provider, nor its management, which might be public or private.

36.	 Unsurprisingly, private providers serve on average the largest customer base followed by regional
companies, municipal companies, and small formal providers. As Table 1 shows, the few privately managed
utility companies in the region tend to have the largest size, at around 175,000 customers served. The more than
600 regional companies, defined as those that serve more than one municipality, serve an average of 70,000
customers, and dominate in countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
The more than 3,000 municipal utilities serve on average around 12,000 customers and are most prevalent in
Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, and Montenegro. Finally, there are close to 7,000 small
formal providers almost exclusively in Austria, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine, with an average size of about 800

   Kosovo Utility Regionalization, 2002–2007
   The main motive behind the Kosovo utility regionalization effort was to transform small and fragmented municipal companies
   into self-sustaining business organizations with clear customer orientation and to create an environment conducive to attaining
   socioeconomic goals for the Kosovar population. The reform of the utility sector took place in the context of the authorities’ EU
   integration agenda, which implied transposition of the relevant EC framework and adoption of prudent management principles
   and practices such as river basin management, integrated water resources management, and the like. Prior to sector reform,
   there were 35 municipal companies in operation offering water supply and wastewater collection together with other municipal
   services. The reform process was carried out in three phases:



                                    Unbundling                       Consolidation                                       Corporatization
                                      (2002)                         (2003–2004)                                          (2005–2007)


   Consolidation of the service providers also had a positive effect on the performance side. The key performance indicators
   since then have been making steady improvement. For example, the billing and collection ratio and the metering level have
   increased steadily, allowing better measurement of water consumption, thereby generating more revenue. The staffing level and
   the operating ratio remained stable, with modest improvements. Yet, NRW fluctuated over the same period, showing limited
   efficiency gains.

37.	 In an effort to benefit from economies of scale, establish cross-subsidies, and facilitate absorption of EU
funds, several countries are promoting or imposing the aggregation of small providers into regional utilities.
Countries like Kosovo and Romania had already embarked on such reforms in the mid-2000s, while other countries,
such as Croatia or Hungary, started more recently. These reforms, among other things, set a minimum size
requirement, thus necessitating utilities that do not meet this requirement to merge or absorb smaller municipalities,
and limit access to state or EU funds to compliant utility providers. The regionalization process in Croatia and
Romania is ongoing, with the expectation that it will result in a smaller number of large regional providers. A number
of other countries in the region, including Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine, have also identified consolidation of water
services as a sector priority, but have not yet adopted a regionalization agenda at the national level (Figure 19). A more
detailed discussion of the outcome of those aggregation processes is provided in Section C of Chapter V.

38.	 Wastewater services management is often provided by the same utility companies, except in a few countries
where they are managed by separate companies in larger towns. Historical reasons have led larger cities in the
former Austro-Hungarian area (Austria, Hungary) to have different companies for water and wastewater. In fact, in
Austria, of about 6,000 utilities, only 150 provide integrated services. This historical separation has also encouraged
somewhat more innovative governance models on the wastewater side: Budapest wastewater management is
managed by a private company even though the water supply has been re-municipalized; the wastewater treatment
plant in Zagreb is operated under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme; in Austria, special-purpose districts
(Gemeindeverband) have been set up by nearby municipalities to share the investment and operation costs of
wastewater management and treatment facilities. In most of the rest of the region though, wastewater services are
operated by the water utility companies.

39.	 In some countries, municipal utility companies provide more than water and wastewater services. In Slovenia,
for example, the type of a utility depends on its size; larger utilities tend to provide water supply and wastewater
services only, while smaller ones may also include gas, district heating, and solid waste management, among other
municipal services. FYR Macedonia is the only country in the region where multisector is the most common type
of utility; Macedonian utilities normally provide all communal services to their customers. This was also the case
in Croatia until recently, when a new act led municipalities to split water and wastewater services away from their
communal enterprises.

40.	 Most service providers in the region are controlled by local governments and went through a process of
corporatization. As a result of a widespread decentralization effort in the 1990s, in almost all countries local
governments are responsible for public service provision, and own the service providers, with limited exceptions in
Bulgaria, Hungary, and Kosovo (Figure 20). In a review of a dozen well-performing public utilities, World Bank staff
identified shared characteristics of those utilities (see box). Legally at least, utility governance in many countries of
the region match the first characteristic of external autonomy: the legal personality, accounts, and staff of public
utility companies have been separated from the controlling jurisdiction that retains a sole or majority ownership of
a corporation’s stock. In most utilities, the shareholding ministries or municipalities appoint the board of directors,

   Characteristics of well-performing public utilities
   External Autonomy
      XXAlthough utilities do not have complete authority to set their tariffs, they are able to put forward proposals that are

         consistent with their overall revenue requirements.
      XXPublic procurement rules, though considered intrusive, were followed without a significant impact on performance.

      XX Although most utility managers do not have total control of setting staff salary scales, they are able to hire and retain qualified staff.

      XXMost public utilities rely on government to source investment financing.

      XXBoard members are generally appointed by the government to represent the interests of owners.



   External Accountability
      XXAll utilities are subject to well-defined performance targets.

      XXPerformance  contracts are useful tools for sharing information but have limitations for enforcing performance.
      XXThe use of external auditors to enhance fiduciary responsibilities is almost universal.
      XXMost public utilities require authorization to secure external financing.

      XXExternal groups can be represented in utility advisory or management oversight bodies.

      XXIndependent regulatory arrangements are the exception rather than the norm, because most utilities are regulated by their

        owners.


   Internal Accountability for Results
      XXSenior management systematically reports to their boards on performance.

      XXIncentive-based systems for top management are common.

      XXStaff members are also subject to rewards and penalties to achieve well-defined performance targets.

      XXMost public utilities have focused on training for improving staff skills.



   Market Orientation
     XXUtilities outsource mostly noncore functions and retain core functions.

     XXAlthough benchmarking exercises are becoming common, there are no clear-cut paradigms for using data collected for

        improving performance.
     XXMost utilities are not involved in market testing.



   Customer Orientation
     XXPublic water utilities have developed billing and collection systems that best overcome specific constraints faced by

        various groups of customers.
     XXPublic utilities actively survey their customers to learn their opinions and views.

     XXCustomers have the opportunity to express their preferences regarding service options.

     XXCustomers are informed about service changes or interruptions.

     XXUtilities have developed effective complaint mechanisms.



   Corporate Culture
      XXWell-defined mission statements provide an internal indicator of good corporate culture.

      XXPerformance is the basis for salary increases in most utilities.

      XXUtilities provide ample career opportunities to their staff and experience low turnover.

      XXWater utilities have training programs for their staff as part of their annual performance agreements.

      XXStaff members are informed of management decisions on a need-to-know basis.

with the exception of FYR Macedonia, where nongovernmental representatives can also be members of the board.
Utility management is appointed either by the board of directors or directly by the government. In some cases, the
relationship between the utility and the government is formalized in a performance agreement (Table 2). In practice
though, the spirit of an arm’s-length relationship between corporatized utility companies and their controlling
jurisdiction is not always respected, and local governments and mayors often maintain tight control over managerial
and staffing decisions in their utilities. The characteristics of external accountability, market orientation, customer
orientation, and corporate culture, are far less often observed.

41.	 Most countries in the region did not embark on significant private involvement in the provision of water and
wastewater services. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several countries experimented with PPPs for their larger
cities, leading to concession contracts being signed for cities such as Bucharest, Budapest, and Sofia, as well as a
large share of the population in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. A management contract was also attempted in
Gjakovë-Rahovecare in Kosovo. More recently, Ukraine has developed a number of notable public-private partnership
(PPP) schemes, such as the long-term lease agreement between the City of Odessa and the privately owned company
Infoxvodokanal, and a large scale concession contract between Luhansk Oblast and the Russian private operator
Rosvodokanal. At present, though, few of the countries continue to actively pursue the traditional concession model,
with services in Budapest, for example, being re-municipalized. A number of softer PPP models are emerging,
however, for the management of specific facilities (BOTs in Zagreb, Serbia, and Kosovo) and for the delivery of
outsourced services, sometimes on a performance basis.

42.	 Every country in the region has a utility association, and sometimes more than one. Strong waterworks
associations exist in most of the EU members, led, for example, by ÖVGW in Austria, MAVIZ in Hungary, and ARA in
Romania. In most countries of the Former Yugoslavia though, the creation of such associations is more recent, and
their human and financial capacity more limited. Knowledge exchange activities such as conferences, workshops, and
journals are the most popular services provided by associations to their members, followed by association lobbying
and advocacy work. Seven associations in the region draft and set technical standards and guidelines as part of their
service offerings (Table 3).

43.	 In rural areas, water services are normally organized through a nearby utility, community-based organizations,
or self-provision. Overall, self-provision and community-operated systems account for about 26 percent of the
population. Little is known about the informal service providers, which are normally beyond policy and regulatory
reach and thus pose particular challenges for the sector due to their small size, limited technical and financial
capacity, and large numbers. Many countries in the region consider the aggregation or integration of such smaller
providers into regional utilities as the most viable option to improve the quality and sustainability of services. However,
such solutions might entail significant additional costs for public utility companies, and countries that traditionally
have had to deal with such situations, such as Austria, have developed alternative mechanisms to provide support to
those service providers, as the experience of Upper Austria Water shows (see Box).



   Upper Austria Water, an association of rural cooperatives
   Founded in 1946, Upper Austria Water is an autonomous, self-reliant,                 Federal State of Upper Austria
   nonprofit association of more than 1,700 cooperatives located in the               more than 1,700 water cooperatives
   Federal State of Upper Austria. Chaired by a board of seven directors, it
   manages water-related activities, especially in rural areas, and is in charge of
   decentralized, small-scale water supply and sewerage installations and flood
   protection and irrigation.


   Water cooperatives aim at securing sufficient, high-quality, and cost-efficient
   drinking water supply through the construction and operation of autonomous
   installations. The personal involvement and honorary services of members
   make this collective quality-controlled water supply an economical method of
   supply. The association provides support to its members on technical, legal,
   financial, and organizational issues. It supplies operational and maintenance
   services (technical assistance, emergency supply, mobile technical
   equipment), pooling programs (for water meter purchase and water analyses,
   for example), and measurement services (such as leak detection, pipe and
   valve location, flow rates and pressure, and aquifer tests). It also proposes
   education and training sessions and conducts networking activities and
   information exchange opportunities for its members.

B.	Policy Making
44.	 Water services sector policy-making responsibilities remain with central government authorities, but are
usually shared among different ministries, sometimes creating coordination challenges. Defining strategies
and policies of water services in the region remains the responsibility of the central government and its different
ministries in almost all countries of the region (the only exception being Bosnia and Herzegovina - Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina Entity, where water services policies are the responsibility of regional authorities). The
tradition of a strong central government is still present in some countries (Ukraine), while others are experiencing
extensive decentralization (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Policy-making responsibility for water service provision
is commonly shared among different government ministries and is broadly follows a similar pattern where (a)
water resource management is mostly the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture (but in some countries
also of the Ministry of Environment), (b) water utility affairs and infrastructure development are the responsibility
of the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Regional Development (or other ministries dealing with local self-
governments), (c) wastewater treatment standards are mostly the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment,
and (d) drinking water standards are mostly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. The multiplication of
water-services-related ministries sometimes creates confusion or leads to a lack of ownership for any utility
reform agenda. To alleviate this challenge, some countries have resorted to the creation of coordination bodies
(the Inter-ministerial Council for Water in Kosovo and the National Water Council in Albania, for example). In
other cases, the waterworks association (Romania) or the regulatory authority (Hungary) have taken active
policy coordination or advocacy roles. In only a few countries (such as Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia) all aspects
of water service provision are concentrated in a single ministry (usually the Ministry of Agriculture), but even in
those cases, the Ministries of Environment and Health retain significant monitoring and environmental protection
responsibilities.

  The Water Framework Directive
  The Water Framework Directive (WFD, Directive 2000/60/EC) has introduced into EU legislation a new objective to protect aquatic
  ecosystems in a more holistic way, while considering the use of water for life and human development. The WFD has introduced
  a number of key principles into the management and protection of aquatic resources, including an integrated planning process
  at the scale of river basins, comprehensive assessment of impacts, economic analysis of the measures proposed or taken, and
  integrated water resources management principles encompassing targeting environmental objectives with water management
  and related policy objectives. The key tool for the implementation of the WFD is the River Basin Management Plans and the
  accompanying Programs of Measures to improve water status. The directive aims to achieve good water status in all natural
  surface waters and groundwater. For surface waters, the definition of “good” is based on a new concept of “ecological quality,”
  taking into account biology, chemistry, and their physical features. The WFD provides for a number of deadlines by which Member
  States must fulfill particular obligations. Furthermore, the WFD introduces the requirement of cost recovery for water services, as
  well as public information and consultation in water management.



45.	 Even though EU water directives do not explicitly mandate specific governance or regulatory frameworks
for water services, they implicitly drive sectorial changes in the region, not only in member countries, but
also in the membership-aspiring countries. EU water directives (primarily the WFD, the Urban Waste Water
Treatment Directive [UWWTD], and the Drinking Water Directive [DWD]—see boxes), are mostly concerned
with the protection of water resources, the environment and human health, and the sustainable use of water
resources. In contrast to directives in other sectors, they do not explicitly mandate specific governance or
regulatory frameworks for the provision of water services, and in fact, among EU member states in the Danube
region and beyond, a wide diversity of organizational structure can be observed. Their main direct impact on
water services is through the definition of requirements for drinking water quality, wastewater collection and
treatment requirements (part of the EU acquis communautaire), and the overall requirement for recovery of
costs in accordance with the polluter pays principle. However, some stakeholders in the region have derived
further implicit or perceived policy recommendations, such as the need to consolidate water utilities to facilitate
the absorption of EU funds and the development of cost-effective investment packages; or the demand for a
stronger regulatory framework to ensure compliance with the cost recovery requirements. At any rate, all EU
member countries have completed the formal transposition of relevant EU water directives, and candidate or
potential candidate countries are in the process of aligning their water policies with requirements of the EU
acquis and relevant EU directives.

46.	 EU directives compliance deadlines for each new EU country are defined in the Accession Treaties, and are
set on the basis of the size of agglomeration, percentage of load and/or individual agglomeration, and sensitivity
of receiving waters. While some EU countries in the region have reached full compliance with the directives, the
transition deadlines for certain categories have still not arrived for Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia
(see Chapter IV, Section C for an overview of current compliance rates). Notably, several potential candidate countries
have started the transposition of EU directives into their national systems, even before obtaining formal candidate
status, demonstrating early commitment to EU directive objectives.

47.	 The large majority of countries in the region have prepared water strategies that define sector strategic objectives.
The preparation of a solid water sector strategy is seen as a foundation of sector development in most of the countries
of the region, and such documents were recently prepared and adopted in 12 countries of the region (Albania, Austria,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
and Serbia), while a further two countries (Kosovo and Moldova) have drafts prepared. Only two countries (Hungary and
Ukraine) do not have a designated water sector strategy, but cover the water-related issues through a number of different
sectorial strategies or government programs. Adopted national water strategies commonly provide strategic objectives,
and determine resources and actions needed to achieve sectorial goals. The water supply and sanitation sector is mainly
focused on (a) increased water supply and sanitation coverage, (b) improved protection of waters from point source
pollution, and (c) achieving cost recovery and sustainability of operation within 10 to 25 years. In EU member and candidate
countries, all recently prepared strategies have a strong EU compliance dimension, and objectives that are aligned with
transposition of EU water directives (aiming for full compliance by the end of the agreed individual transition period). The
only exception is Austria, which is already in compliance with the EU directives, so its focus has shifted to maintenance and
climate change adaptation as the next level of challenge in the water sector.


   The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive                                              The Drinking Water Directive
   The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD, Directive 91/271/EEC) is             The Drinking Water Directive (DWD,
   an emission-control-oriented directive and one of the major water policy tools in      Directive 98/83/EC) concerns the
   Europe. Its objective is to protect the water environment from the adverse effects     quality of water intended for human
   of discharges of urban wastewater from settlement areas and from industrial            consumption and defines the essential
   wastewater from the agrofood sector. The directive applies to agglomerations           drinking water quality standards at EU
   with more than 2,000 population equivalent (p.e.), and requires the appropriate        level. Its objective is to protect human
   collection of sewage and regulates discharges of wastewater by specifying the          health from the adverse effects of any
   minimum type of treatment to be provided and setting maximum emission limit            contamination of water intended for
   values on the major pollutants (organic load and nutrients). The directive requires    human consumption by ensuring that it
   the collection and treatment of wastewater in agglomerations with a p.e. of over       is wholesome and clean. The directive
   2,000, and more advanced treatment in agglomerations with a p.e. greater than          applies primarily to systems providing
   10,000 in sensitive areas. It is widely considered to be the most expensive piece of   drinking water to more than 50 people
   legislation of the acquis communautaire.                                               or 10m3/day.


48.	 Even among countries with significant Roma minorities, few perceive this as a water service provision issue or
have specific service provision schemes for such groups. While a number of countries in the region, including Bulgaria,
Romania, and Slovakia, have large concentrations of Roma (see Chapter II, Section B), only in FYR Macedonia and Bosnia
and Herzegovina do some utilities have a special approach to marginalized groups (consisting mostly of the free provision
of a basic quantity of water or discounts on the water tariff). All other countries state that they have the same approach to
all customers regardless of their ethnicity or social status. The issue of the position of marginalized groups is commonly
defined in national strategy (in some cases in legislation) for such groups, but assistance for populations with adverse
social and economic conditions is usually provided by a combination of state and municipal support, with very few cases
also including direct subsidies for water or other municipal services (see Chapter VI, Section D for more details).

49.	 Gender is not perceived as an issue in the water services sector, even with disproportionately low representation
of women in water utility staff. Gender imbalance is not perceived as an issue in the water sector in any of the 16 countries of
the region (SoS data collection), and is as such not covered under existing sector strategies. However, expert opinions also
confirm that there is a general gender imbalance among water utility staff, particularly at the decision-making/management
level. Underrepresentation of women among utility staff is usually explained by experts as being due to the physically
demanding work requirements, although this does not explain the underrepresentation of women at the management level.

C.	Resource Management
50.	 Water resources management mostly follows an Integrated Water Resources Management approach. The
Development of River Basins Management Plans in EU member countries, and adoption of the Integrated Water
Resources Management (IWRM) approach to water resources management and flood protection dominates
throughout the region, consistent with WFD requirements. Preparation and implementation of those plans are
generally under the responsibility of the line ministry responsible for water management (which is in most of the
countries the Ministry of Agriculture, but in some countries also the Ministry of Environment). A few countries, such as
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, and Serbia, have established national state water agencies with significant
water resources management responsibilities. As mentioned in Chapter II, Section D, those plans are then made
consistent with the Danube River Basin Management Plan under coordination of the ICPDR.

D.	Regulation
52.	 In the last 15 years, countries in the Danube region have been part of a trend toward greater independent
regulation of water and wastewater service provision, especially in counties with larger or regional utilities. Of
the 16 countries included in this report, 9 have an independent regulatory authority that oversees the water services
sector: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Of these regulatory
agencies, only the Albanian Water Regulatory Authority started operating before 2000. Others were established
or assumed regulatory functions over water services in the last 15 years (Figure 21), often in parallel with or as a
prerequisite to a utility sector restructuring or regionalization effort (Croatia, Kosovo, Romania). In addition, there are
ongoing discussions and studies being conducted to evaluate the possible formalization of regulatory frameworks in
three additional countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, and Montenegro).

53.	 Of the nine independent regulatory authorities in the region, only three are water-sector specific: Albania,
Croatia, and Kosovo. The remaining six authorities are multisector, also regulating the electricity, district heating,
and gas sectors, among others. One of the arguments in favor of a multisector regulator instead of a dedicated one
is to allow the transfer of regulatory knowledge and expertise from one sector to another. Furthermore, a multisector
model, at least theoretically, would increase independence of the regulator by not allowing a single sector to dominate
the agenda and make the agency financially dependent on any sector or large utility. Yet, this may not be the case in
practice. In a regulatory workshop organized by the Danube Water Program, two multisector regulators said that the
water sector often takes a lesser regulatory priority than the electricity sector in their agencies, sometimes resulting in
postponed decision making when it comes to the water sector.

54.	 All regulatory authorities in the region play a formal role in tariff setting and approval, often alongside local
government authorities. Of all regulators, only the Hungarian one has an advisory role in the tariff-setting process
(the formal decision rests with the line ministry). The remaining regulators have a direct responsibility for determining
tariffs, either by formally setting them or by reviewing and clearing proposed tariffs, often after they have been
previously approved by local government councils. In countries that have no dedicated economic regulator, regulatory
functions such as tariff setting and service quality monitoring are generally performed by local governments,
sometimes with the involvement of a national government control mechanism (FYR Macedonia, Serbia).

55.	 Tariff-setting methodologies vary across countries, but a revenue cap is most widely used. Four countries in
the region—FYR Macedonia, Kosovo, Romania, and Ukraine—use the rate-of-return approach. Hungary, Montenegro,
and Serbia do not have a developed methodology for determining tariffs in place. In practice, however, since utility
companies in the region are largely owned by local governments, which largely prioritize lower tariffs rather than
higher profits, tariff setting is not as effective a regulatory instrument as it would be in a private, profit-driven context.

56.	 Regulatory agencies in the region vary widely in their independence, governance, and financial and human
resources. Although all agencies are nominally independent, in about half of the cases they depend on the state
budget for their operation, and their management is appointed by the executive branch, as opposed to the parliament.
Furthermore, overall staffing and budget vary significantly, although some trends can be observed. Regulatory
agencies that regulate mostly municipal utilities tend to have a ratio of around one staff for each three to four utilities
regulated, while agencies that regulate large regional operators (Hungary, Kosovo, Romania) tend to have around two
staff for each utility; Croatia, where the regulatory framework is still incipient, is an exception, with only one technical
staff for the whole country (Table 6).

57.	 Service quality regulation is normally the responsibility of a public health ministry or agency, while
environmental regulation is the responsibility of an environmental ministry or agency in each country. None of the
countries in the region have concentrated all regulatory activities under a single agency; in fact, in a number of cases
the regulatory agencies have been established on top of existing structures, leading to complementary or sometimes
conflicting roles vis-à-vis local governments and line ministries.

of institutionalized utility performance information systems and other benchmarking schemes in all countries of
the region. In all countries with an established regulatory agency, the institution has taken the lead in developing at
least a limited utility information system. Practices with regard to whether the information is processed into a formal
regulatory ranking or performance revaluation, and whether it is made publicly available, vary, however. Only two

such institution exists, waterworks associations have often developed voluntary utility benchmarking schemes to help
their members improve their performance, and in some cases to allow for more effective lobbying for greater support
to the sector.

IV.	 ACCESS TO SERVICES
60.	 Access to water and sanitation services in the Danube region is high compared to the rest of the world. The
collection and treatment of wastewater is lagging behind the generally high access to piped water and private flush
toilets, especially with respect to EU standards that most countries in the Danube watershed aim to comply with.
However, when computing access by lower-income or minority groups or across subnational regions, service gaps
become visible that would need to be addressed through targeted policies or investments.

61.	 This chapter provides an overview of the access situation in all countries. The statistics are estimated from
household survey data and have been compared with similar statistics reported by the Joint Monitoring Program,
a WHO/UNICEF-managed database with statistics on water and sanitation access. Apart from national household
surveys, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) was applied where national budget survey data
were not available.

62.	 Estimating the statistics outlined in this section from the original surveys, whether national or EU-SILC, provides
an opportunity to compute access by different income groups, ethnicity, and region, which is not otherwise available.
Methodological Note A at the end of this document lists the different surveys, the variables informing income, and the
questions posed in the surveys to estimate access to services.




A.	Water
63.	 Household coverage with piped water has remained consistently high in countries within the Danube
watershed since the beginning of the millennium. EU Member States and candidate countries have witnessed a
small but significant increase in service coverage, which is mirrored by a small but significant decline by non-EU
countries, including Moldova and Ukraine.13 Figure 22 also shows the persistent and slowly widening gap between EU
member and candidate countries and their less-EU-integrated peers in the East.

64.	 On average and based on household survey statistics, 83 percent of the population in countries within the
Danube watershed have access to piped water in their dwelling. However, not all households receive their water
supply from public utilities, since average coverage through formal public networks is reported to be only 74 percent.14

13		 This trend analysis is based on data collected by WHO/UNICEF 2012. Average access to piped water by the population in the Danube watershed
countries, excluding Kosovo, was 75 percent in 2012, which is slightly lower than the average statistics of 83 percent estimated from the most recent
household surveys, largely because the WHO/UNICEF numbers were not updated after the latest round of household surveys became available.
14		 This statistic is reported by each country and constitutes the “known” provision of piped water by public utilities. It also includes coverage of

The difference of about 10 percent can cautiously be attributed to alternative water providers, which could range from
small communal systems, prevalent in less densely populated rural areas, or makeshift connections established by
the household and unknown to the utilities. As Figure 23 shows, the largest gap between public utility and alternative
provision is in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, at 28 and 29 percent, respectively.

65.	 Spatial differences in access within countries explain why some countries are lagging behind. Most EU
countries exhibit near-100 percent piped water access irrespective of location (see Figure 23 on the right), and even
poorer countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo show a low access gap between rural and urban residents,
though with perhaps higher reliance on providers other than public utilities. Yet, access to piped water by rural
residents is half or less of urban coverage in Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine, which are also the countries with the
lowest average access to piped water.

Sources: Spatial and average access is computed from various household surveys (2010–2012); piped public supply is derived from various sources
compiled through the SoS data collection and reported in the statistical annex by country.



66.	 About 22.5 million people, or 17 percent of the region’s population, have no piped water supply in their
dwelling. Half of the population without piped water is located in Ukraine (12.4 million) and another quarter is
located in Romania (5.8 million), mostly in rural areas but also with large populations without piped water in
urban spaces. Overall, lack of piped water access is largely a phenomenon of rural or less densely populated
settlements, which typically lack the economies of scale to cost-effectively provide network services through
modern infrastructure (figure 24). However, it is important to bear in mind that almost all people (99 percent,
excluding Kosovo) are reported by the Joint Monitoring Program to have access to improved water sources,
including protected wells, springs, and other onsite solutions, to meet their water supply demands (WHO/UNICEF
2012), so the challenge in European countries and their neighbors is more about service standards than basic
needs.

67.	 Access to piped water by poorer segments of the population can be only partly explained by differences
in the wealth of a country. Richer or more mature EU countries (Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovakia, and Slovenia) managed quite successfully to include poorer segments of the population (that is, the
bottom 40 percent and those living on less than $2.50 a day PPP per capita), as shown in Figure 25. Yet, some
of the poorest countries, notably Kosovo with the second-lowest per capita GDP among the Danube countries
(US$8,700 PPP in 2013), also managed to ensure high access for the bottom 40 percent (93 percent) and the
poorest (84 percent). In contrast, Romania’s GDP per capita is slightly higher compared to Bulgaria’s (US$18,600
versus US$15,900 PPP), yet, average access to piped water is lower in Romania (71 percent versus 98 percent in


households that share a water tap, which is why the piped public water supply could exceed the piped supply received by households in their dwelling,
as reported in the household surveys.

            68.	 Compared to their non-Roma neighbors, Roma generally have lower access to water and sanitation in most
            countries of the Danube watershed. Informality or remoteness of Roma settlements, discrimination, outstanding
            utility bills, and lack of financial resources to pay connection fees interact together but differently in each locality
            to explain limited access. Results from a survey of the largest Roma settlements in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
            Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia reveal significant differences in access to improved water and sanitation by Roma
            compared to their non-Roma neighbors (see Figure 26). While these estimates do not reflect country-level statistics,15
            they are important because they compare households living in the same neighborhood (thereby controlling for
            remoteness) but coming from different ethnic backgrounds.

            15	 	National statistics by ethnicity are reported only for Romania, and these show access to piped water within household by the Roma population
            of 47 percent compared to the national average of 71 percent. Access to improved water sources is expected to be significantly higher because the
            statistics include shared piped water services and other water sources that are considered safe for consumption.

 B.	Sanitation and Sewerage
 69.	 Almost 80 percent of the population in Danube watershed countries report using a flush toilet in their dwelling,
 yet only 66 percent are connected to public sewer networks. Although progress has been made in the region since
 2000 in increasing the coverage of the population with connection to sewers, changes are mostly visible among EU and
 EU-candidate countries (Figure 27). For Moldova and Ukraine, access to public sewers was already high 15 years ago
 due to the importance devoted to wastewater collection in the Former Soviet Union, but has been stagnating since.

 70.	 The difference between access to flush toilets and public sewers is largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and
 Montenegro (see Figure 28). Comparisons between access to flush toilets and sewers need to be made with the caveat
 that statistics on access to flush toilets are derived from household survey data and include only those with a private toilet
 in their dwelling, and statistics on access to public sewers are reported by national authorities and include households that
 share a toilet, while excluding those that have other safe means of excreta disposal, such as septic tanks.

 71.	 Even more than piped water supply, lack of access to private toilets is most prevalent in rural areas or areas
 with low population density. Moldova has the lowest reported coverage of private toilets by the rural population (7
 percent), but Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine also report rural access statistics below or just above 40 percent. In
 terms of absolute numbers, most of the population without access to private toilets is located in rural areas; only in

             Croatia and Kosovo are those without access distributed in almost equal proportion, as shown in Figure 29. In terms
             of sheer numbers, rural Moldova and Ukraine together account for slightly more than half of the population that does
             not have access to private toilets within the countries of the Danube watershed (51 percent). With the addition of
             Romania, almost 80 percent of the total number of residents without access to private toilets can be found in these
             three countries. Also, Bulgaria’s rural population is largely uncovered, contributing more than 5 percent to the total
             percent of those not covered with private toilets in countries of the Danube watershed.

             72.	 Less than 20 percent of the poorest and less than half of the bottom 40 percent have access to a private toilet in
             Bulgaria, Moldova, and Romania. The low access—on average and for poorer segments of the population—is particularly
             striking in Bulgaria, which performed significantly better on piped water and is much more urbanized compared to the other
             two countries (73 percent compared to 45 percent in Moldova and 54 percent in Romania) (Figure 30). Low access by the
             poor in Bulgaria is also mirrored by the low access to improved sanitation by Roma, outlined in Figure 26, above.

C.	Wastewater Treatment
73.	 Wastewater treatment coverage shows significant improvement over the last 15 years (particularly in EU member
countries), but still remains the least developed aspect of water service provision. At the beginning of the EU expansion
process in the region, wastewater treatment was significantly less developed than other aspects of water services provision,
with about 35 percent of the total population in the region connected to any level of treatment in 2000 (Figure 32). The
situation has been gradually improving following EU expansion in the region and large investments that have followed in EU
member countries, but the region is still significantly behind other parts of Europe in the area of wastewater treatment.

 of the population in Central European countries and 84 percent of the population in Northern European countries
 connected to a wastewater treatment plant compared to only 67 percent of the population in the EU countries of
 Eastern Europe. Due to much focus on nutrient removal from wastewater, tertiary treatment of wastewater has seen
 a very significant increase over the last decade throughout the EU. Currently, about 50 percent of the population in
 the new Eastern European member countries has tertiary level of treatment, which is still much lower than the EU
 average but which represents a 30 percent increase compared to 10 years ago. There are major differences in tertiary
 treatment in the region, with about 90 percent of the population in Austria, 60 percent in the Czech Republic, and
 20 percent in Slovakia (SoS Data collection and EEA 2015) connected to tertiary treatment, while tertiary treatment
 remains nonexistent in the southern part of the region (including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia,
 Montenegro, and Serbia)

 deadlines to reach full compliance. EU directives, as mentioned, require wastewater collection for all settlements
 with population above 2,000, although sewage treatment requirements vary by settlement size and sensitivity of the
 area. Among the EU countries in the Danube watershed, Bulgaria’s and Slovenia’s compliance rates with respect to
 wastewater collection are only 15 and 32 percent, respectively, while Romania is still “in transition” and will need to
 make significant efforts to meet future compliance deadlines (EC 2013, 2, Annex). Both Bulgaria and Slovenia are

expected to meet compliance with wastewater collection in settlements with populations above 2,000 by 2015 (SoS
data collection). Croatia still has a grace period, but needs to start working on closing the gap, since only 44 percent of
its residents are connected to a public sewer system.

    Technical standards in the Danube region
    Technical requirements for design and construction of water supply and sanitation structures in all countries of the region are
    defined by national legislation (usually consisting of construction law and associated secondary legislation), and existing national
    technical standards, while those that are EU members are in compliance with EU design and construction requirements. Several
    countries in the region have traditionally relied on German DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung) standards (Croatia, Slovenia),
    or the Former Yugoslavia JUS (Jugoslovenski Standard) standards (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia), while some still use their
    nationally developed technical standards with the tendency to gradually adopt them to those used in EU countries. Former
    Soviet-era technical and construction standards (that are solid on technical grounds but often not concerned with economy of
    operation) still apply in countries that were part of the Former Soviet Union (Moldova and Ukraine). In newly created countries like
    Kosovo, development of technical standards and water supply and wastewater norms is an ongoing process, but the objective
    is development of standards based on EU requirements, while in the transitional phase, they are mainly using DIN standards as
    ready-made and widely respected technical norms.

    Service standards and cost-effective solutions under EU directives
    Neither the Drinking Water Directive (DWD) nor the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) includes specific service
    standards or requirements at the household level. However, throughout Europe, piped water and flush toilets on the premises,
    which go beyond the JMP definition of improved services, represent the most commonly accepted service level. Both the DWD
    and the UWWTD impose quality standards, however, and in the case of UWWTD, collection standards if water and wastewater are
    produced, which evokes the question of how to address in a cost-effective way those requirements, in particular in cases where
    there is no public infrastructure in place.
    The UWWTD establishes the conventional wastewater collection and treatment systems as standard for agglomerations above
    2,000 population equivalent, but also provides the option of individual or other appropriate systems, where a centralized system
    would produce no environmental benefit or because it would involve excessive costs. However, in such cases, those systems
    must achieve the same level of environmental protection, which in court cases (Case C-119/2002 Commission v. Greece) has
    been confirmed to mean discharges to the soil must be treated to the same level as discharges to water bodies, thus limiting the
    use of this clause. Recent Commission guidance generally limits the use of such systems to 2 percent of a given agglomeration.
    Furthermore, in smaller settlements, centralized low-cost systems such as wastewater ponds and constructed wetland systems
    are extensive wastewater treatment options that are simple to operate, have a low energy demand, and can meet the requirements
    of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive for settlements below 10,000 population equivalent, even for sensitive areas. In
    addition, increasing attention has recently been given to modern onsite, decentralized, or semi-centralized wastewater management
    concepts that are already applied in several of the most advanced European countries (Germany, Holland, Sweden), particularly
    in rural and semi-urban areas. These concepts comprise collection, treatment, and disposal or reuse of wastewater from small
    communities (from individual homes to portions of existing communities) using many small sanitation/wastewater treatment
    facilities designed and built locally, that are more flexible, sustainable, and cost-effective (WECF 2010).

V.	 PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
77.	 The overall performance of water and wastewater services, in terms of their quality and efficiency, varies widely in the
region, but is generally below international good practices. In the last 20 years, however, positive trends have been registered
on a number of dimensions, showing that utilities in the region are slowly converging toward international standards. The
overall performance of utilities appears largely driven by the country’s own level of development, with EU members generally
leading the way. However, a more detailed analysis also sheds further light on the drivers of utility performance.

78.	 This chapter covers services provided by formal utility companies (“public supply”), which represent about
three-quarters of the population in the region (see Chapter IV). Unfortunately, little information is available about
the performance, quality, or even costs of informal providers (community or village systems and self-supplied
households), which represent one-quarter of the population. Further work on understanding those services will be
necessary in the future. However, whenever possible and meaningful, the figures in this chapter include the weighted
average16 for EU members (blue), EU candidate countries (green), and non-EU countries (red), as well as good
practices (in green and taken as the 90 percent top percentile of best-performing utilities in the region).

79.	 Most of the information in this chapter is derived from two sources, a country-by-country effort conducted under
this review to collect publicly available country-level data about service performance (cited as SoS data collection
and referenced individually in the country tables at the end of the document), and the large dataset available from the
International Benchmarking Network (IBNET) / DANUBIS database, which covers more than 450 utilities and close to
3,400 observations between 1995 and 2013. Both sources entail potential data challenges. Country-level data usually do
not offer long time series, and present an average, rather than the entire spectrum of data. In addition, the quality of the
data varies significantly, and is limited in those countries that do not have an independent regulatory agency collecting
utility performance data. Furthermore, IBNET / DANUBIS data do not systematically include all utility companies (highest
coverage is in Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Kosovo, and Moldova); therefore, trends and averages might not
be fully representative of the overall sector. Finally, as discussed in the last section, the country-level averages mask a
high heterogeneity among companies within the same country. The exact sources and values of the indicators and data
mentioned in the text are listed in full in the tables at the end of this document, and the methodological approach for this
chapter’s analysis is detailed in methodological notes also at the end of this document.



A.	Service Quality and Customer Practices
80.	 In many of the region’s countries, water service is generally continuous, and drinking water meets national
quality standards. There are, however, exceptions, most notoriously in Albania, where many of the utilities do not
provide continuous supply, and in Moldova, where drinking water quality is an ongoing challenge. Wastewater
treatment plants, where operating, generally also fulfil the requirements issued in the licensing permit, except again
in Albania and Moldova, and in Kosovo and Montenegro, where wastewater treatment has largely only recently
been introduced. Table 8 and Figure 34 provide an overview of the situation in the different countries for which
information is available.

81.	 Customer satisfaction is, unsurprisingly, higher where service quality is higher. According to a 2013 Gallup
poll, customer satisfaction with water and sanitation services in most countries of the Danube region is lower than
the EU average, with EU members faring better than candidate countries and non-EU members (Figure 35). Perhaps
not unsurprisingly, customer satisfaction is also relatively closely correlated with overall service performance as
measured by the Water Utility Performance Index (see Section C in this chapter for more details).

82.	 Customer protection mechanisms are somewhat underdeveloped in the region, particularly in countries
without regulatory agencies. In about half the countries in the region, the law mandates that utilities have an internal
customer complaint redress mechanism; however, few utilities voluntarily conduct customer satisfaction surveys,
with the exception of privately managed utilities in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, for example. Those countries that
do not have independent regulatory agencies generally do not offer an external institutional mechanism to address

16	 Averages are generally weighted by country population.

  complaints or evaluate customer satisfaction. Among those countries with an established independent regulator,
  almost all provide a formal customer complaint mechanism through the regulator, but few have more comprehensive
  customer protection practices. In fact, only Albania, where the regulator was established almost 20 years ago, reports
  the use of tools such as public hearings for tariff setting, as well as the signing of formal contract service agreements
  between utilities and their customers (Table 9).

   Drinking water quality standards                                  Wastewater treatment quality standards
   Requirements for drinking water quality reflect                   Requirements for wastewater treatment and discharge as prescribed
   transposed requirements from relevant EU directives               by relevant EU requirements (Directive 86/280/EC, 86/278/EC and
   (Directive 98/83/EC on quality of water intended for              91/271/EC) concerning urban wastewater treatment (UWWTD)
   human consumption), and CEN (Comité Européen                      have been transposed into national legislation in all EU member
   de Normalisation) standards are transposed into                   countries. Some countries, like Austria, have adopted national
   national legislation in all EU member countries, while            standards that are higher than EU or WHO requirements. As part

   drinking and wastewater discharge requirements are                related wastewater treatment requirements. Moldova and Ukraine

 84.	 Conversely, individual consumption has followed a steady downward trend. Due to the increase of individual
 metering, increasing tariffs, and the decrease in industrial activities throughout the region, overall consumption of water
 per person has decreased over the last 10 years and is stabilizing around EU-wide standards of 100 liters per capita per
 day to 120 liters per capita per day, with notable exceptions particularly among countries of former Yugoslavia, such
 as Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia (Figure 36 and Figure 37), where tariffs are also
 among the lowest (see Chapter VI). As tariffs continue to increase and apartment-level metering spreads further, it can
 be expected that individual consumption will continue to decrease in those countries where it is still relatively high.

86.	 Nonrevenue water (NRW) has been and continues to be a significant challenge. Although the structure of NRW
in the region is not well defined because of the lack of proper metering and water balancing in most utilities (see box),
overall NRW generally stands much above good practice levels, with the exception of countries in the western part
of the watershed (Figure 38). While NRW should not necessarily be minimized at all costs (there is an economically
efficient level of NRW, which depends on the cost of further reducing NRW and on the opportunity cost of water
produced and billed), current levels are much above those of even similar utilities and levels of development in other
regions. Furthermore, a review of the evolution of NRW over the last 10 years shows no clear regional trend, with
utilities in Bulgaria and FYR Macedonia showing increases in NRW, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, and Romania
showing decreases, and most other countries remaining stable at a high level. Some of the data heterogeneity is
likely to derive from better measurement of NRW today than 15 years ago because of the widespread adoption of
systematic metering on the production and distribution side.

   87.	 Energy efficiency is an important but less researched issue in the region, as well. Although regional information
   is not systematically available, evidence from a limited sample of utilities appears to show that energy costs per cubic
   meter produced have been increasing in recent years (Figure 39), pointing to the need to focus further on energy
   efficiency measures. In fact, a review done in the context of the Danube Water Program of more than 30 treatment
   plants, pumping stations, and hydraulic systems in utility companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro,
   Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine demonstrated a potential for energy savings averaging 35 percent, with values higher in
   countries with a legacy of limited investments in maintenance, such as Ukraine (50 percent). Most of the investments
   needed to materialize those energy-saving potentials would have payback periods of only two to three years, but
   financing for such efforts is not easily accessible.18

88.	 Utilities in the region are commonly staffed at levels above regional good practices. Overstaffing is a
traditional issue of many locally owned public utility companies in the region. Trends in the region show, however,
steady improvements in staff productivity (Figure 40), especially in those countries where initial staffing levels were
significantly above international practices. However, in a number of countries the levels of staffing per 1,000 people
served are still above international good practices of 1 employee per 1,000 people served,19 even though the range of
services provided is often lower than elsewhere (limited sewer coverage and wastewater treatment).

89.	 The commercial efficiency of utility companies is generally solid, but varies widely throughout the region. The
collection ratio, that is, the ability of a utility company to collect billed revenue from its customer base, is often used as an
important proxy for sound commercial practices. The region’s performance in this respect is solid, with the average collection
ratio of many countries above 90 percent, but with some important exceptions in Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Montenegro, for
example (Figure 41). Payment morale in countries in the western part of the watershed is particularly high, as it is for countries
of the Former Soviet Union. Collection rates in countries in the central and southern part of the watershed are lower.

increases with the level of economic development of the country. Figure 43 shows in which performance
quintile utilities in each country fall. For example, 100 percent of the utilities in the Czech Republic were among

database, while for Albania and Kosovo, the data show that utilities overreport the population in their jurisdiction, since the combined market share
reached more than 100 percent of the total population of the country.

 the 20 percent of best performers in the region in 2013. Not surprisingly, utilities in the countries that were
 among the first to join the EU (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia) also perform particularly well, whereas
 countries that are farther away from joining the EU have a larger proportion of struggling utilities. Also, while
 in many countries the performance of utilities is relatively homogenous, in a few countries such as Albania,
 Bulgaria, and Serbia, there is much more dispersion of performance. This is particularly important because it
 indicates that in those countries, the enabling environment is such that it is possible to perform at a high level,
 yet many utilities do not do so.

 92.	 Overall, the performance of water utilities has improved over the last 10 years. The previous paragraphs and
 chapters have already shown positive trends in the region, particularly with regard to sewerage and wastewater
 treatment services coverage, as well as utility efficiency. Those trends can be confirmed by an aggregated analysis
 of the Water Utility Performance Index. Figure 44 shows, for example, the proportion of utilities in the overall
 sample that fall under each quintile of performance during 2000–2007, for which the sample is relatively consistent
 in terms of country participation. The share of worst performers decreased during this period from 10 percent to
 5 percent of the sample, whereas the share of best performers increased from 28 percent to 40 percent. A similar
 trend can be observed for the average WUPI of the sample, which increased from 67 to 73 during the same period.
 The trend is further confirmed that in the overall sample, the WUPI of utilities in the last year they appear in the
 database is 3.7 points higher than the first year they appear (Klien 2015).

 93.	 The region’s utilities also show a converging trend toward better practices. The analysis shows that utilities
 that start with a lower score show higher improvements than utilities that already have a higher score at the
 beginning, hinting at a convergence of the overall performance of utilities in the region toward better practices
 (Figure 45). The detailed analysis also shows that most utilities perform relatively consistently over different
 dimensions, meaning that utilities that show a high level of service coverage or quality also tend to show better
 managerial indicators, for example.

 94.	 Utilities displaying better performance also generally have higher tariffs. A scatterplot of utility
 performance against average revenue per connection (taken as a proxy for average tariff) shows a wide
 dispersion (Figure 46), with EU member utilities having generally higher performance, and non-EU member
 utilities having a higher tariff income per connection (in PPP terms) than utilities from EU candidate countries.
 Overall, however, Figure 46 and underlying analysis show that utilities that display better performance also tend
 to have higher tariffs. In other words, quality has its cost, and it is particularly telling that no utility with high
 performance simultaneously offers low tariffs (bottom right corner of the figure). Conversely, though, there are
 many low-performing utilities with relatively high tariffs, which should engender questions from those holding

them accountable.22 A more detailed review of the data shows that utilities with higher service coverage and
quality (the first two groups of WUPI dimensions) tend to have higher tariffs, while utilities with better managerial
practices (the last WUPI group of dimensions) tend to have lower tariffs (Table 10). Unsurprisingly, though, the
savings from improved management practices are not sufficient to compensate for the higher revenues needed
to sustain the better services, and an overall improvement of 10 points in the WUPI score is associated with a
tariff increase of 6.7 percent (Table 10).

95.	 At the country level, the drivers for utility performance appear to be largely external to the sector.
A systematic econometric analysis of utility performance against a range of external drivers reveals mixed
messages. Much of the variation in performance in the sample can be explained by country context—which
is largely beyond the reach of sector policy makers. In other words, some countries (Austria, for example)
simply offer better conditions for utilities to be successful than others. More specific policy changes, such as
the establishment of a formal regulatory framework or the EU accession and membership process, cannot
be shown from the dataset to demonstrate a clear short-term impact on utility performance. However,
this is largely driven by constraints from the available data and cannot be taken as the basis for policy
recommendations; anyway, such reforms take significantly longer to demonstrate impact than the time series
available in the database.

96.	 At the utility level, however, some clear drivers of performance, such as size and density, emerge, but they
are difficult to translate into concrete policy recommendations. Utility governance models tend to be relatively
similar for most utilities in a given country and within a given size range. The dataset, therefore, does not allow
conclusions on which utility governance models might provide better results. The analysis confirms, however,
that the water sector, like many others, is prone to economies of scale, and utilities that are larger and/or serve
denser areas are more likely to have better performance and lower costs than their peers, everything else being
equal (Figure 47). It is, however, important to consider that those benefits cannot easily be reaped by changes
of sector policies. The density or size of a city are equally beyond the reach of sectorial policy makers, and the
mere aggregation of several operators into larger ones does not produce the same clear outcome (see paragraph
below).

97.	 The impact of regionalization or aggregation processes on utility performance and cost is not unambiguously
positive, and policy makers should carefully weigh the particular circumstances of their country before promoting
such processes. In an attempt to achieve economies of scale and ensure more professional and financially stable
service providers, a number of countries are turning toward the aggregation or regionalization of service providers
(see Section A in Chapter III for more details). The analysis of the dataset, based on a rigorous difference-in-
differences approach (Klien 2015), does not allow general conclusions to be drawn, and each country should evaluate
the pros and cons of a regionalization process. Contrary to generally held opinions with regard to the positive impact
of regionalization or aggregation processes on overall performance and costs, the analysis offers a number of
cautionary tales showing, for example, that:

   XXAggregated   utilities perform only marginally better, on average, than similar utilities that do not go through an
       aggregation process. The most positive impact occurs on managerial performance, while service quality is

       unaffected and coverage is negatively affected.23 The actual overall impact depends on the characteristics of the
       merged utilities (size, performance) and on the merger process itself (number of merged utilities, overall increase in
       size).

   XXAggregation   processes involving fewer utilities and generating denser service areas provide positive benefits,
       whereas mergers with large numbers of utilities and limited gains in density or population served tend to return
       negative impact on overall performance and costs.

   XXSmaller   utilities that merge or aggregate reap higher benefits (in terms of costs and performance) from
       aggregation than larger utilities, indicating that economies of scale are nonlinear and large utilities cannot
       expect to further improve their performance or reduce their costs by growing.

   XXThe   effects of aggregation processes are most marked in the first few years after the merger, and tend to
       dissipate over time.




23	 This is likely because the additionally aggregated systems have lower levels of coverage than the incumbent’s.

VI.	FINANCING OF SERVICES
98.	 Increasing costs have driven increases in tariffs throughout the region, to the point where services might
become unaffordable for lower-income customers in some countries; yet the region is still far from putting the
Water Framework Directive’s (WFD’s) principle of cost recovery into reality. Countries in the region have adopted
varied approaches to the financing of water and wastewater services; the cost structure and pricing approach also
varies widely from country to country. However, common to most countries are above-inflation increases in both
costs and tariffs, as well as significant levels of subsidies for investments and to a lesser extent operational costs.

102.	 The structure of financing of services in the region varies widely from country to country, but investments are
generally supported by public funds and external transfers, while operational expenditures are mostly covered from
utilities’ own tariff revenue. The shares of overall sector financing stemming from transfers is generally higher for new
EU members due to the strong financial impact of EU funds; conversely, for most of those, the share financed from
tariffs is relatively low—an interesting finding in view of the WFD’s cost recovery requirement (Figure 49). The share of
financing coming from taxes—either through direct investment or operating subsidies, or through the reimbursement of
IFI commitments and other loans—is relatively constant at between 10 percent and 20 percent across most countries,
representing around 0.1 percent of GDP, with the notable exception of Montenegro and, to a lesser extent, Albania
and Kosovo. Contrary to other regions, water sector expenditures do not represent a significant fiscal burden on most
national governments, which rely instead on transfers when available (most often from the EU) and tariffs as the main
instrument to recover sector costs. This finding is consistent with the strong role played by local governments in the
provision of services, shown in Chapter III, and shows the limited leverage national governments have over the sector.

103.	 Despite the widespread adoption of the cost recovery principle in national legislation, only two countries—the
richest and the poorest—rely on tariffs to finance around 90 percent of the sector. As shown in Table 11, the vast
majority of the countries in the region have inscribed in their national legislation the principle of cost recovery. The reality,
however, is quite different. In Austria and Moldova, the absence of EU funding and limited fiscal space mean that around
90 percent of sector financing comes from tariffs. In most other countries, taxes and transfers represent between 25
percent and 75 percent of the sector’s overall financing, which as long as access and consumption is relatively even,
means subsidies are spread evenly or are income neutral. However, that financial support becomes a regressive public
expenditure when access to public services is not evenly shared, so that only those with public services are reaping
the benefits from that public spending. Since richer households typically use more water (having more appliances, like
washing machines or dishwashers), consumption is also rarely even, and public spending therefore disproportionately
reaches households with higher water consumption. In contrast, when public spending is targeted to address existing
access gaps or affordability constraints (as will be discussed later), such spending could become more progressive.

104.	 Few countries have developed a dedicated water sector financing mechanism providing predictable funding.
In most countries, investments are financed from external transfers or ad-hoc IFI-supported loans repaid by state or
local government budgets. While many countries partly finance the sector’s investments from their national budget,
about a third of the countries have a dedicated mechanism to finance investments (Table 11), guaranteeing more

    predictable funding. One such example is Croatia, where water extraction rights and wastewater discharge fees are
    managed by the national water agency and finance €70 million in annual investments (see Table 4 in Chapter III for
    more details). However, even in countries with such schemes, the decisions on the use of funds are often somewhat
    arbitrary and are not necessarily directly linked with the sector’s policies and strategies. Not surprisingly, in all EU
    member countries and the more advanced candidate countries, EU-related funding (Cohesion Funds, regional policy
    funds, Instrument for Pre-Accession [IPA] funds) represent the majority of external financing to the sector, while in
    other countries, IFI and bilateral donors continue to play the main role.

    24	 The absorption rate for water-specific EU funds has been assumed to follow the same trend as overall EU funds absorption in a given country,
    although anecdotal evidence shows absorption in the water sector is lower than average.

105.	 EU Funds now represent a large majority of external financing in the region and have displaced other
traditional lenders. Although it is challenging to obtain an accurate overall picture of investment flows into the
region, an analysis of OECD and EU data shows that overall external investment funding has grown in the last 15
years (Figure 50). Much of the growth is due to EU funds, which are limited to 8 of the region’s 16 countries, and the
funding has displaced to some extent traditional lenders such as IFIs and bilateral donors, which were providing
high levels of funding particularly in the western Balkans following the conflicts in the 1990s, but gradually moved
out as the EU funds and IPA funds became more important. A comparison of publicly available information about
EU funds going toward the sector and actual investments shows, however, that in most of the EU countries,
EU funds represent only a limited part of the overall investments, ranging from around 10 percent in the Czech
Republic (where the private sector absorbs most of the needs) and 30 percent in Romania, to a much higher value
of around 60 percent in Bulgaria.




B.	Services Expenditures: Operating and Investment Costs
106.	 On average, the sector directs about half of overall expenditures toward operating and maintaining
(O&M) infrastructure, and half toward renewing or expanding it. Figure 51 shows the proportion of overall costs
going toward O&M and toward investments for countries in the region. There is an important variation among
countries, with the share of overall costs going toward investments varying between one-third and two-thirds.
The superimposition of levels of investment (as a percentage of GDP) on the same figure logically shows that
countries that have a very high expenditure going toward O&M are those that also spend less on investment overall,
raising potential concerns about long-term service sustainability. In those countries for which data are available,
investments in wastewater are a priority, a reflection of the gaps in service levels compared to water supply
(Chapter IV). Furthermore, the significant share of sector resources going toward investment shows the importance
of carefully managing and developing assets, and applying the principles of efficiency not only to the operating of
water utilities, but also to the planning and implementation of investment projects. In that respect, the particularly
low levels of investment (as a share of GDP) in countries such as Moldova, Serbia, and Ukraine, and to a lesser
extent Hungary, should raise questions about whether assets are properly managed and maintained in the long run
or tariffs are maintained artificially low by living off assets, which will eventually result in reduced service quality.

107.	 Total water and wastewater investments in the region are around €3.5 billion a year, significantly lower than
the €5.5 billion estimated by the region’s governments to be needed to achieve EU or national targets. Governments
or external financiers in most countries have estimated the amounts needed to achieve each country’s own targets or
to comply with the EU acquis, and the combined national estimates amount to €5.5 billion of necessary investment

           annually. Actual investment levels are around 55 percent of this level, leaving a gap of more than €2 billion a year
           (Figure 52). Overall, about 40 percent of all investment needs are directed at water supply and compliance with the
           Drinking Water Directive, while 60 percent are for wastewater management and compliance with the Urban Waste
           Water Treatment Directive (see section B in Chapter III for more details on both directives, and Chapter IV for a
           discussion on the infrastructure gap). Furthermore, a country-by-country review of projected investment needs and
           current investments (Figure 52), shows that:

                                        XXMost   countries project investment needs higher than their current levels of investment. Only the Czech Republic
                                          has investment levels generally at the level of its projected needs.
                                        XXEU members and candidate countries project higher investment needs than non-EU members; even Austria,

                                          where access to wastewater services is already high, projects significant investment needs largely because of
                                          the need to renew assets built in the first wave of wastewater investments, around 30 years ago.
                                        XXMore recent EU members—Bulgaria, in particular—are still struggling to absorb EU funds efficiently and show

                                          significant funding gaps.
                                        XXMost countries outside the EU have significantly lower investment levels and generally do not currently cover

                                          their needs.

           C.	Cost Recovery: Cost and Tariff Trends
           108.	 The costs of providing services varies widely from country to country but have grown significantly over
           the last 20 years, leading to parallel tariff increases. The chapters on access to services (Chapter IV) and utility
           overall performance (Chapter V) have demonstrated how the sector’s overall performance has improved, in terms
           of coverage and quality of services, in the last 20 years. The necessary investments, in particular for the extension
           of wastewater collection and treatment, have been matched by significant increases in overall operating expenses.
           Figure 53 shows the evolution of operating costs in a sample of water and sewerage utilities, with increases in many
           countries, particularly EU members, going beyond 100 percent in constant PPP. Figure 54 shows how utilities have
           had to grow their revenues in a similar fashion, largely through tariff increases. Despite decreasing consumption,
           per-connection revenues grew at an annual rate of more than 10 percent (in real terms) in utilities of new EU members

        such as the Czech Republic and Romania, and to a lesser extent, Hungary. Even in non-EU members such as Kosovo,
        Moldova, and Ukraine, utility revenue increases averaging 5 percent per year in real terms were observed over
        sustained periods of time. Such steady increases, in the absence of sustained and broad-based economic growth, can
        lead to serious affordability constraints, as will be discussed in Section D of this chapter.

        109.	 Both O&M costs and residential tariffs generally follow the level of economic development of countries, with
        costs and tariffs highest in EU member countries. As Figure 55 shows, there is a relatively close relationship between
        O&M costs and residential tariff levels. Austria clearly shows the highest costs and tariffs, followed by all EU members
        except Bulgaria, where costs and tariff levels are significantly lower than those in the other EU member countries. In
        contrast, most countries of the Western Balkans have tariff levels far below the regional average, despite the fact that
        affordability is not generally a constraint, as will be discussed in Section D of this chapter.

    110.	 Full cost recovery from tariffs does not appear to be a priority in any country, and many utilities in the
    region do not even cover their operating costs from billed revenues. To maintain service quality in the long run,
    utilities should be able to recover their operating and regular maintenance costs, as well as those necessary for
    asset management and renewal, from their own revenues. Figure 56 displays the average operating cost coverage of
    utilities in the region, measured as the net billed sales over operating expenses, including depreciation; utilities should
    have an operating cost coverage above 1 to be financially self-sufficient in terms of O&M. As the figure shows, only
    in a minority of countries do utilities recover all of their operating expenses from own revenues. While the average for
    EU member countries is above one, even some EU member countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary (where strong tariff
    controls are in place), and Romania, which formally fall under the EU WFD requirement of cost recovery, do not appear
    to fully comply. The overall situation is not particularly positive, especially considering that utilities in a number of
    countries fail to collect a significant share of billed revenues (see Figure 41), and therefore the actual ability of utilities
    to finance themselves is even lower (provisions are seldom made for accounts receivable write-offs).

    Source: Authors’ elaboration from SoS data collection.
    Note: The apparently very high value for Kosovo should be looked at keeping in mind that Kosovo has one of the lowest collection ratios in the region,
    and therefore collected revenue is significantly below billed revenue, which is used to compute this indicator.




    D.	Addressing Affordability
    111.	 Although tariffs have increased over the last decade, current levels are still affordable for the average
    consumer. As outlined in section C of this chapter, real tariffs have increased by 5 percent to 10 percent per year,
    on average, over the last decade, but clearly so have disposable incomes among residents. Computing reported
    expenditure on water and wastewater as a share of income for different income groups reveals that the average
    expenditure is well below the 5 percent threshold,25 with the highest shares of 4.4 percent and 4.2 percent observed
    in Ukraine and Romania, respectively. Both countries also show the highest share of households that have water and
    wastewater expenditure above 5 percent (28.8 percent for Romania and 32.5 percent for Ukraine).



    25	 Different donor institutions have applied different thresholds for assessing affordability constraints of utility services, including electricity, heating,
    water, and wastewater. An excellent overview of these thresholds is provided in Fankhauser and Tepic 2005, 5. For water and wastewater, 3 to 5 percent
    of total income is the typically applied benchmark to assess an affordability constraints.

112.	 Estimations of the expenditure share for the bottom 40 percent show a slight increase, but affordability
constraints are prevalent only in Ukraine. There, more than half of households among the bottom 40 percent face
a water and wastewater bill above 5 percent of their income, and people within that income group pay 5.8 percent,
on average, for water and wastewater services. Computing the expenditure share of the extreme poor (that is, those
living on less than $2.50 a day PPP) shows only Romania having viable statistics (that is, a sufficiently large sample
size), according to which the poorest pay 5.1 percent of their income for water and wastewater services. Not all
countries have household surveys that report water and wastewater expenditure separately from other utility or rental
expenditures, but those that do are reported here and in Figure 57.

  percent can only be explained by difference in samples or lower hypothesized consumption.

    113.	 When assuming that the entire population would be connected to piped water and sewage services at a
    minimum consumption level and prevailing tariffs, affordability constraints emerge in Moldova and Romania. Using
    reported country statistics on average tariffs and assuming a minimum but sufficient consumption of 100 liters per
    capita per day,26 expenditure for water and wastewater collection and treatment were computed for each household,
    taking into consideration the size of household and income as reported in the household surveys. The share of the
    computed expenditure in total household income was subsequently calculated, to understand whether average
    expenditure on water and sewage—at income levels reported in the household surveys—would exceed recommended
    thresholds. Under these assumptions, Moldova and Romania both show expenditure for water and sewage services
    above 4 or 5 percent of income for the average citizen, and near 7 and 8 percent for the bottom 40 percent of
    income distribution. Moreover, 32 percent of households in Moldova and nearly 45 percent in Romania would incur
    expenditures above 5 percent, and 100 percent in Romania and more than 80 percent in Moldova belonging to the
    bottom 40 percent would face expenditures for water and wastewater above 5 percent. This implies that connecting
    the largely rural populations in Moldova and Romania to piped water and sewage systems would, at current tariff
    levels, not be affordable for large segments of the population. Although combined water and wastewater expenditure,
    at 2.3 percent of income, appears to be affordable to the average Bulgarian citizen, almost 60 percent of households
    incur charges above 5 percent, which can be explained by a significant portion of very low incomes in the country’s
    income distribution (Figure 58 and Figure 59).

    114.	 Several countries have defined thresholds to identify affordability constraints at much lower levels than
    5 percent. For example, Bulgaria sets an affordability limit of water and sewage expenditure at 4 percent of the
    average disposable household income and if the entire population were covered under the outlined assumptions,
    Bulgaria’s bottom 40 percent of households would hit that limit. Croatia uses 2.5 percent of median disposable
    household income, and the Czech Republic designates 2 percent of the average net household income as the
    threshold. Under given scenarios, the Czech Republic would exceed that threshold slightly for the average income
    earner and more so for the bottom 40 percent; yet, current average consumption in the Czech Republic is also
    lower (88 liters per capita per day) compared to what has been assumed as basic but sufficient consumption. Both

116.	 The performance of subsidy schemes ultimately depends on what percentage of the subsidy reaches
households in need of such subsidy. By definition, subsidies delivered by charging tariffs below cost or through
transfer from local government to utility budgets are not targeted, and one would expect a large part of the subsidy to
be leaked to households that are not poor (the so-called “errors of inclusion”). Means-tested programs, often applied
in combination with other social protection efforts, have a higher chance of reaching the poor, but only when the
criteria to identify poor households are rigidly applied. The example of the low-income family allowance in Ukraine
demonstrates that the targeting performance of this means-tested program is relatively high—with the lowest 20
percent earners receiving 78 percent of the subsidy—but the coverage performance is low, since the program does
not reach 97 percent of the poorest households (the so-called “error of exclusion”). In contrast, Ukraine’s housing and
utility allowance is not allocated based only on income, and its targeting performance is poor, with only 32 percent of
the total subsidy reaching poor households (Betliy, Movchan and Pugachov 2013).

VII.	CONCLUSIONS
117.	 In their quest to achieve sustainable services for all, countries across the Danube region show very different
levels of progress, with the level of progress generally mirroring the level of economic development of the country.
In many ways, the sector is today in a better position than it was 15 years ago, but governments in the region will
need to continue aligning policies, institutions, and financing mechanisms to ensure that service coverage, quality,
and efficiency continue to improve while managing affordability constraints. Particular attention is needed to support
the most vulnerable, the poor, minorities, and the rural population in obtaining access to affordable, quality services,
as well. In this regard, the EU accession process represents a tremendous opportunity to influence the sector’s
trajectory—but one that could easily be squandered if governments focus only on EU funds absorption and pure
compliance, or push reforms without carefully looking at how the reforms address their specific challenges and the
broader services sustainability agenda.

118.	 The report analyzes the capacity of countries to deliver sustainable water and wastewater services for all
across four main dimensions: access to services (Chapter IV), quality of services (Chapter V), efficiency of services
(Chapter V), and financing of services (Chapter VI). In this concluding chapter, those dimensions are consolidated into
an overall services sustainability assessment with the aim of pointing to areas of particular challenge in each country.
Each of the four dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators, drawing from the rest of this
report (Figure 60). For each indicator, best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the
region. Countries closest to the best performers are deemed to have more sustainable water services.27 The region’s
main challenges are also discussed, as are the opportunities presented by the current situation. The chapter also
highlights areas of insufficient information and future work.

119.	 Given the limits of the data and analysis, policy makers and stakeholders should use these conclusions
in a broader dialogue to critically examine what specific recommendations could be derived for their particular
context. Although every effort has been made to validate the information presented, an exercise involving 16
countries and hundreds of sources of information is inherently challenging. There are information gaps, and
only limited times series, and the quality of information is much better in some countries than in others. Some
of the data sources might not be fully comparable. While the household-level analysis is representative at the
country level, the utility data are not always comprehensive. National averages sometimes mask the significant
heterogeneity within a country. Therefore, the report and its conclusions are meant to inform the policy dialogue
in each country around priorities and areas of further work, rather than provide definitive recommendations. In
parallel, this chapter also identifies a number of areas where more work is needed to understand the situation of the
sector and put forward sound conclusions.




A.	Sustainability of the Water and Wastewater Services across
the Region
120.	 The water sector has been strongly impacted by the region’s overall trajectory over the last 30 years, from
the socialist period, to the transition period, into the EU accession process. While countries throughout the region
are at different stages of their own development, most share a similar trajectory toward European integration, which
conditions, indirectly and directly, the development of the water services sector. Table 12 summarizes the main
components of this evolution in terms of the external context and the main policy and service performance trends,
which helps provide context for the overall conclusions presented in this chapter.

121.	 The overall services sustainability assessment shows there is a significant gap between EU levels and the
performance of EU candidates and non-EU countries, which might require a different approach to their accession.
Figure 61 shows the results of the services sustainability assessment, combined for the following groups: EU
members, EU candidate countries, and non-EU countries, for each of the four dimensions and 12 indicators of the
assessment. It is clear from the rest of the report that there is a wide diversity of situations in the region, but the figure
highlights once again the significant gaps existing between EU members, candidate countries, and non-EU countries.
Those gaps, not just in access, but also in service quality, efficiency, and financing, appear to be much larger than the
gaps the recent EU members faced when they joined. In the context of an overall EU accession effort, decision makers
on all sides should reflect on whether the time and financial and normative frameworks that have helped recent EU

members meet the requirements of their accession treaty are still the adequate ones for candidates with much larger
gaps, or whether they should be rethought to take into account broader sector development needs.

122.	 Beyond the EU accession framework, the assessment also shows that despite a general correlation between
economic development and services sustainability, some countries appear to outperform their peers. A plot of the
services sustainability assessment for different countries against the level of GDP per capita (Figure 62) shows a clear
correlation between economic development and water services sustainability assessment. EU members lead the
region in services sustainability and economic development, with a few interesting exceptions. For example, the Czech
Republic performs much better than Slovakia and Slovenia at the same level of GDP per capita; conversely Romania
appears to face higher challenges than other countries at the same level of economic development, largely because of
the much higher share of rural population in the country. The EU candidate countries present relatively similar levels
of services sustainability, but Kosovo, for example, has the most sustainable sector among those despite having the
lowest GDP per capita, possibly because of a clear and stable sector organizational framework (see Box in Chapter
III). Finally, Moldova, the least economically developed country in the region, also faces the greatest gap in achieving
universal, efficient, and sustainable services.

123.	 Although each country is at a different stage, all have areas in which they can further improve. Table
13 identifies, for each country, the overall score and qualitative outcome for each of the four dimensions of the
assessment. As the table shows, most EU members do well providing access to services for all, and most countries in
the region offer reasonably good service quality to those connected to public supply. The efficiency agenda is highly
relevant for most of the recent and non-EU member countries. Sound sector financing remains an issue throughout
the region, with some exceptions in older EU Member States.

    B.	Remaining Challenges
    124.	 With much of the region’s attention focused on the EU accession process, a number of broader
    developmental challenges must be addressed to successfully move ahead, particularly among recent and future
    member states. The review shows how EU members, especially those that joined before 2007, have benefited from a
    generally stable policy environment and a steady stream of EU funding. Access in particular to wastewater services

 has increased, the performance of their utility companies is generally at par with international practices, and despite
 some concerns with regard to affordability, the financing of their services is sound, as well. However, some of the
 more recent EU members and candidates are facing a significantly different situation, with important basic services
 gaps especially among the most vulnerable, a focus on investment absorption rather than cost-effective solutions,
 service providers less prepared to assume the responsibility of developing and maintaining the necessary assets,
 underfunded services, and incomplete or unclear sector governance. The governments’ attention is understandably
 focused on the transposition of EU legislation and development of wastewater management infrastructure. However
 governments should also address a series of broader, but related, sector challenges to ensure that all citizens benefit
 fully from the EU accession process. Below is a summary of the key regional challenges identified in this report. A
 more nuanced and detailed discussion of each country’s specific challenges is included in the Country Notes that
 accompany this regional report and which are available on the SoS.danubis.org website.

     XXWhile    service provision remains a local government responsibility in most countries, policy reforms
        accompanying the EU accession process tend to subject those services to increased national regulatory and
        institutional oversight, creating the need for clearer accountability mechanisms. After an initial wave of strong
        decentralization and local government empowerment in the 1990s, reforms explicitly or implicitly linked to the
        EU access process are increasingly reasserting the role of national governments, through the establishment
        of new national regulatory agencies in more than half of the countries in the last 15 years (led by Albania and
        Slovakia), and the various efforts to regionalize or aggregate service providers (led by Kosovo and Romania).
        In practice, though, implementation of those reforms has lagged. New regulators often struggle to extend
        their regulatory reach over large numbers of local public service providers and achieve meaningful regulatory
        outcomes. Sector financing strategies have not been developed upon adoption of the cost recovery principle.
        Utility companies and management continue to be largely driven by local interests. In many cases, those
        reforms have not yet borne fruit, and the analytical work done under the State of the Sector review shows that
        the long-term impact of such policies is still to emerge. While the EU accession offers a tempting opportunity (or
        excuse) to resort to regional recipes, governments would do well to look at the actual reasons that undermine
        the institutions’ ability to deliver on their mandate, and address those by establishing a clear responsibility,
        accountability, and incentive framework for service providers and local governments, before attempting far-
        reaching reorganizations.

     XXWhile  wastewater management captures much of the public attention, there are 22.5 million people without
        piped water and 28 million without flush toilets in the Danube region; rural populations, the poor, and
        minorities are disproportionally represented among them (Figure 63). The centralized collection and treatment of
        wastewater is a clear objective of the Urban Waste water Treatment Directive, and many governments are focused

     on addressing it. However, as Figure 63 shows, although the overall level of access to water and sanitation services
     is high throughout the region, there are still important equity challenges in providing access to basic, good-quality
     services to all. For example, there are still 22.5 million people without piped water on their premises (the vast
     majority of whom use shared pipes, or have springs or wells in their backyards), and 28 million without flush
     toilets—with rural populations, poorer households, and minorities disproportionally represented. Even among those
     who have access to public services, the rapidly increasing tariffs have meant a particularly high burden on the
     bottom 40 percent and on the poorest share of the population, particularly in those countries where most unserved
     people live (Moldova, Romania). The unaffordability of tariffs could threaten the gains in extending access to all
     through infrastructure development, unless sound subsidy schemes are implemented.

 XXThe     performance of many service providers in the region still trails regional and international best practices,
     threatening the long-term sustainability of ongoing investment programs. While positive trends have been
     observed since the socialist period ended, progress appears to be stagnating in more recent years, and many
     utilities—the main actors ensuring sustainable services for all, at least in urban areas—remain short of operating
     at good practices levels (Figure 64). This report shows, however, that improved management practices can
     help mitigate the impact of increasing asset development and management costs, and that in most countries
     there are utilities that outperform their peers by a wide margin, independently of the sector’s organization and
     structure. Failure to address the performance of utilities will threaten the sustainability of the large ongoing
     investments in infrastructure, particularly for wastewater management.

 XXThe    sector’s overall financing framework does not guarantee universal, high-quality services in the long
     term. The Water Framework Directive and sound sector policies have led to the widespread adoption of the cost
     recovery principle in national legislation; however, many utility companies are barely recovering their operating
     costs from tariffs, and tariffs are widely set with limited consideration of the established regulatory frameworks.
     At the same time, this report shows that in most countries, there is still significant space for tariff increases
     without creating affordability constraints for the average household. The financing of investments, including
     from EU funds, is done in an ad-hoc manner, with transfers distributed with limited attention to equity and
     cost-effectiveness of projects, and taxes providing untargeted subsidies (Figure 65). The significant taxes and
     transfers going toward the water sector represent a missed opportunity for national governments to provide
     the right set of incentives to service providers. The estimated investment gap is around €2.5 billion a year, and
     investment levels in a number of countries are below the levels necessary to maintain and manage assets in the
     long run. Costs are expected to continue to rise rapidly in the future. In the absence of a sector financing policy
     providing the proper efficiency incentives to service providers on both operation and investments, coupled with
     clear, well-targeted subsidies to address affordability concerns for the poor, service providers will not be able to
     provide universal, high-quality services in the long term.

  XXMore          and better publicly available data are necessary for sound policy making, utility performance
           improvement, and management accountability. A recurrent challenge in many of the countries—surprisingly,
           particularly in more advanced economies including Austria or Slovenia, for example—is the lack of publicly
           available, structured, reliable, and representative data about the sector. In the absence of clear data and
           benchmarks, utility managers cannot assess whether their operation is on par with good practices. Without
           reliable sector financing information, policy makers lack a key instrument with which to promote sustainable
           services, and sector planners, in the absence of consistent data about access to services, cannot ensure that
           limited public funds go to those who need them most. Perhaps most important, given the significant amounts of
           public funds going to support water services, citizens, taxpayers, and their elected officials in many countries do
           not have access to transparent information to help them hold accountable sector decision makers at all levels.




C.	Opportunities
125.	 In responding to the challenges identified in the previous sections, the region can also build on a few
important opportunities. Compared to other regions of the world, the water services sector in the Danube region has
a few important assets it can turn into opportunities to continue advancing its development, often by turning existing
challenges around.

  XXThe         EU integration process continues to present a tremendous policy and financing opportunity for many
           countries. The EU accession process has proven, for many recent EU members, an important vehicle to
           build institutions and strengthen rule of law. The water sector is bound to benefit from such changes. More
           specifically to the sector, the process of negotiating and delivering accession commitments creates a higher
           scrutiny of sector financing and organization. Countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania have used those
           processes to plan and implement far-reaching changes in the sector. In addition, EU funds, if used properly, can
           drive change for the sector and reduce inequity in service provision.

  XXRecent         history has shown that the water sector is open to change. Despite their somewhat haphazard nature,
           the policy reforms that have occurred over the last 15 years—ranging from decentralization to public-private
           partnerships and from regionalization to regulation—show that the water and wastewater sector in the Danube

     region is much more open to change than in other parts of the world. In fact, governments in at least a third of
     the countries of the region are currently considering one reform or another. If those reforms are based on a solid
     analysis of the underlying sector challenges and incremental improvements, they can continue to build positive
     momentum in the sector.

  XXThe   widespread adoption of formal regulatory frameworks and utility corporatization reforms can help
     promote greater accountability. The massive decentralization of waterworks to local governments in the early
     1990s greatly empowered mayors and local governments, shortening the accountability lines. Recent changes
     in many countries to establish stronger regulatory frameworks, the progress of open information platforms and
     legislation, and more structured local utility governance forms (the corporatization process) can help establish
     proper checks and balances among the various actors at the national and local level.

  XXDespite   managerial shortcomings, the sector can count on a strong technical workforce. The region has many
     excellent technical schools and universities, and utility staff and midlevel management are often technically
     highly qualified. With the proper managerial training and capacity building, those resources could contribute
     to turning around many of the sector’s institutions. Waterworks associations such as ÖVGW in Austria, ARA
     in Romania, and SHUKALB in Albania, have recognized the important role they can play in promoting such
     professionalization, and are offering formal training curriculums and, when possible, are lobbying for staff
     accreditation schemes to be anchored in the legal framework of the sector. In fact, the International Association
     of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD) itself is currently in discussions with
     waterworks associations around the region to set up a more formal regional training partnership.




D.	Areas of Future Work
126.	 In some cases, more work is needed to properly design and implement sound policies to respond to the
challenges and opportunities above and provide sustainable services for all. This first State of the Sector study
consolidates a vast amount of information from which early trends can already be discerned, but it has also
revealed areas in which more work is needed in order to be able to draw clear conclusions and inform public policies
responding to some of the challenges identified above.

  XXPopulation    without piped or public water supply. A significant number of people do not benefit from
     piped or public water services in the region, often because they lie outside of the services areas of utility
     companies. In the absence of better information on whom they receive service from, at what cost, and
     with what quality, and what would be the welfare and economic impact of providing them with higher
     levels of service, it is challenging to determine how governments can ensure that their entire population
     benefits from sustainable services. More work should also be done to understand what least-cost or cost-
     effective service provision technologies (see box in Chapter IV), models, or support mechanisms could be
     implemented to support those populations without necessarily overburdening existing utility companies by
     making them responsible for those.

  XXDrivers  of utility performance. Improving utility performance is key to the sustainability of services
     provided to three-quarters of the population in the Danube region. Yet, little is understood about why
     some utilities thrive and others do not. Many countries are currently collecting some type of data on utility
     performance, and this report has presented some early analysis of utility performance drivers. However,
     the availability of more systematic data for longer time series should in the long run help decision makers
     better understand the trends and drivers of utility performance in their respective countries and draw
     informed policy conclusions.

  XXLong-term    affordability and subsidies. Most countries are not yet facing significant tariff affordability
     problems. There are, however, some exceptions, and many countries expect to see continued increases in tariffs
     beyond inflation rates. Since few countries have set up targeted subsidy schemes to allow the cost recovery
     principle to be implemented without creating social problems, the proper design and implementation of such
     subsidy scheme should be further explored.

  XXWastewater     management. For most of the countries in the Danube watershed, managing wastewater and
     sludge remains an important challenge in the context of their EU accession process. The Urban Waste Water
     Treatment Directive mandates significantly higher levels of collection and treatment than currently available,
     and the new infrastructure that is being built or needs to be built creates financial and technical strains for
     utility providers. Operating costs and difficulties mean a number of plants are not functioning as intended, and
     alternative service delivery models, involving innovative financing models and institutional arrangements, should
     be developed.

127.	 Most of these areas should be addressed at the national level in the countries where the corresponding
challenges are most pressing, but further work at the regional level would also help document and inform policy
work more broadly. Academic institutions, think tanks, and development partners will all play a role in ensuring that
those knowledge gaps are addressed. In addition, the authors hope that the Danube Water Program will be able to
support work to address some of the above points in the coming years, together with interested governments and
stakeholders.

128.	 This report has presented the state of the sector and its main challenges and opportunities, but it does not
provide policy recommendations. If policy makers and utility managers take only one thing away from the report,
it should be the importance for each government and each management to analyze their current challenges based
on solid information, learn from others’ successes and mistakes, and develop a way forward that will reflect their
local realities and regional and international experience. Many of the challenges and opportunities highlighted above
are current areas of work of the Danube Water Program, and the program will seek to work alongside its partners
to continue filling the gaps revealed by the analysis. It has been an endeavor of the Danube Water Program to
help inform such processes by documenting experiences throughout the region and fostering a dialogue across
institutional and political boundaries. The authors hope this report will contribute toward the realization of smart
policies, strong utilities, and sustainable services for all.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
A.	Access data
129.	 Statistics reported on access are drawn from two sources: household survey data in the case of piped water and
access to flush toilets, and country data collected by consultants in response to the Danube Water Program (DWP)
country survey questionnaire on access to public piped water and access to sewers. The methodological discussion
here refers to the estimation of statistics using household survey data, since these datasets are heterogeneous and
require interpretation and definition.

130.	 Income/wealth proxied by consumption expenditure, self-reported disposable income, or wealth index. The
household surveys used in this analysis report different variables that can proxy for income, which is necessary to
sort households into quintiles or to compute shared prosperity indicators. While the Living Standards Measurement
Survey (LSMS) applied in Albania and the Household Budget Survey (HBS) applied in non-EU countries and Romania,
are similar in the way they estimate income/wealth (that is, from consumption or expenditure of households), the
approach is very different and yields potentially different outcomes from self-reported income, as applied in the
European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) collected by EUROSTAT, or from an asset or
wealth index, as estimated in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) collected by UNICEF. Moreover, a wealth
index prepared in the MICS can only be used to sort households into quintiles, but does not give information on the
distance of wealth between households and, since it does not include consumption/expenditure, cannot estimate
statistics for the poorest households, as defined in this report as those living on less than $2.50 a day purchasing
power parity (PPP).

131.	 Measuring access to piped water and sanitation at the household level. As outlined in table 14, each
survey poses slightly different but often similar questions that are used to inform on access to services. Several
questionnaires, especially the MICSs but also some of the HBSs, have even more detailed information on access to
services that has been analyzed but not used in this report. The most dissimilar question is being posed in the EU
SILC with respect to piped water, perhaps because it is implicitly assumed that households in EU countries mostly
have piped water in their dwelling, so the question posed relates to the quality of that installation. Likewise, country
surveys rarely specify whether household access to a flush toilet implies access to a sewer system, a septic tank, or
nothing, and never do these surveys inform whether sewage collected is treated, since the household may not know
the answer.

132.	 Statistical significance. When estimating access by income/wealth quintiles, ethnicity, region, or shared
prosperity indicators, special attention was paid to whether the estimated indicator is statistically significant by
checking both the standard errors of the estimate (that is, large standard errors relative to the mean are indicative
of an estimation problem) and the design effect (deft), which shows how much the sample standard error varies by
applying “cluster” sampling (typically applied in surveys) as opposed to simple random sampling. A well-designed
sampling framework would typically generate a deft between 1 and 3, with 1 being associated with a lower standard
error and reflecting equal standard errors between cluster and simple random sampling. On the basis of these two
checks, two indicators for the affordability analysis (discussed under point 4 below) are not being reported.

133.	 Data verification. All statistics have been estimated using population weights to generate population estimates
on access. Since the number of observations inflate from sample to total population size, one verification possibility
entails whether population estimated from the survey is approximately equal to the population of the country in that
particular year. The other verification method applied was to compare average estimates on income and access
with other available data reported on these statistics. In the case of piped water access, estimated statistics were
compared with the statistics prepared by the Joint Monitoring Program, and in the case of income, sources including
from the OECD and poverty assessments prepared by the World Bank were consulted to draw comparisons. On all
accounts, the estimated statistics are considered robust.

B.	Water Utility Performance Index
134.	 As part of the utility performance analysis conducted under the State of the Sector study, there was a need to
evaluate the overall performance of specific utilities. To do this, an aggregated performance index, called the Water
Utility Performance Index (WUPI), has been elaborated. The WUPI seeks to emulate an expert opinion; it evaluates the
performance of a single utility taking into account how closely the utility is performing to regional best practices on 10
common Key Performance Indicators. The WUPI is expressed by an aggregated score ranging from 0 (worst practice)
to 100 (operating at best practice level on all indicators).

135.	 WUPI construction. The WUPI is constructed in a simple and robust manner. A set of 10 indicators, selected
among the IBNET28 indicators, is used to calculate the WUPI (Table 16). For each indicator, the regional best practice
value (higher bound) has been defined by using expert opinion and an analysis of the existing database (see Table 15);
the lowest bound has generally been defined as the lowest possible value. The performance of a particular utility is
then evaluated on the basis of a linear relationship between this lower and higher bound. Each indicator is weighted
equally (10 percent) in the overall index calculation. For water-only companies, seven water-related indicators are
taken into account. For wastewater-only companies, six wastewater-related indicators are taken into account, as
shown in Table 15. In such cases weights are adjusted to remain equal.

136.	 WUPI calculation in case of missing data. The overall utility dataset is not complete; therefore, the following
adjustments are made to maximize the number of utilities for which a WUPI can be computed without compromising
the validity of the value:

   XXIf   indicator I1 and I2 are missing, no WUPI is assessed.

   XXIf  indicator I3 (wastewater treatment) is missing, it is replaced by the value 0, hence allowing calculating the
        WUPI of the utility while assuming that the utility does not provide wastewater treatment.

   XXWhen     up to three “noncoverage” indicators are missing (that is, I4 to I10), the average of all other noncoverage
        indicators is used to fill up the missing values. If the utility has more than three “noncoverage” indicators

       missing, then the WUPI is not assessed. This calculation process and threshold have been elaborated based
       on correlation tests that show that WUPI scores remain robust when removing up to three indicators, since
       correlation is above 80 percent to 90 percent.

137.	 WUPI robustness and validation. Due to its construction, the WUPI is a best practice indicator (Table 16). For
given cost/expenditures, higher values represent better performance. The indicator is therefore similar to the APGAR
indicator by IBNET (van den Berg and Danilenko 2011), and is highly correlated to it (0.77). The overall WUPI rating for
a subsample of utilities was also shared with experts from the region who did not detect significant inconsistencies
with their own professional judgment. Furthermore, the correlation between the WUPI based on the full set and
the WUPI where one, two, or three indicators are dropped is very high. In the case where one or two indicators are
dropped, all correlations are above 0.90. Even in the case where three WUPI indicators are missing, only 1 out of 35
correlations with 0.88 is below the 0.90 threshold. These findings confirm that calculating the WUPI based on only
a subset of the indicators does not introduce significant bias. A more detailed discussion of the construction and
validation of the WUPI and its use throughout this report is included in Klien 2015.

C.	Sector financing
138.	 The sector financing calculations focus on the public water and wastewater sector. Expenditure made by the
share of population using onsite water and sanitation facilities, whether piped or not, are not considered. The annual
overall financing of public services in the water and wastewater sector was assessed using data from 2011, 2012,
or 2013, depending on the available information for each. The methodology consisted of (a) assessing the yearly
revenues from tariffs and the yearly operating costs of utilities; (b) using the data collected regarding investments,
local and national taxes, and international transfers to consolidate total funding and total spending values; and (c)
verifying the data to make sure that the overall assessed yearly funding, through tariffs, taxes, and transfers, would
match overall annual spending composed of operation costs and investments.

139.	 Assessment of utilities revenues coming from tariffs. Revenues of water services coming from tariffs were
estimated by multiplying the average water price expressed in €/m3 (for sources, see the “Country Data Summary”
section in the Annex) by the average water consumption expressed in liters per capita per day. Consumption
values were reported in water surveys computed by local consultants. See the bibliography of each Country Note
for a comprehensive source list of consumption appraisal. This amount was annualized to obtain the annual
average water invoice per capita, which was then multiplied by the share of population connected to public water
service (for sources, see the “Access Data” section in the Annex). This amount was then corrected by the billing
collection ratio (for sources, see the “Country Data Summary” section in the Annex) to assess the cash income
effectively perceived by water utilities. The billing collection ratio is defined as the ratio between cash income
and billed revenues (IBNET indicator 23.2). Revenues of wastewater services coming from tariffs were estimated
by multiplying the average wastewater price expressed in €/m3 by the average water consumption expressed in
liters per capita per day. This amount was annualized to obtain the annual average wastewater invoice per capita,
which was then multiplied by the share of population connected to public sewage service. This amount was also
corrected by the billing collection ratio in order to assess the cash income effectively perceived by wastewater
utilities. As a result of this calculation, the yearly revenues effectively collected by water and wastewater utilities
through tariffs were assessed.

140.	 Assessment of utility operation and maintenance costs. The operation and maintenance expenditure of
utilities was appraised by dividing the sector revenues from tariffs calculated according to the above-mentioned
methodology, by the operating cost coverage ratio (for sources, see the “Country Data Summary” section in the
Annex). This ratio is defined as the total annual operational revenues divided by the total annual operating costs
(IBNET indicator 24.1).

141.	 Assessment of utility revenues coming from taxes and transfers. Funding from transfers, expressed in
euros, were assessed using official reference documents such as Sector Operational Programme (SOP), Operational
Programme for Environment (OPE), and Instruments for Pre-Accession (IPA) reports, World Bank reports, OECD
reports, and national reporting. See the bibliography of each Country Note for a comprehensive source list. When the
transfer amounts were known for a several-year period, they were linearly annualized to allow a yearly calculation.
Funding from national and local taxes, expressed in euros, was assessed using official reporting documents
computed by local consultants in water surveys. See the bibliography of each Country Note for a comprehensive
source list.

142.	 Assessment of investment costs. Investment costs, expressed in euros, have been assessed using official
reference documents such as audits of the National Master Plan or National Water Strategy Program, data from the
Statistical Yearbook, and reporting assessments on the spending of EU funds and IFI loans. See the bibliography of
each Country Note for a comprehensive source list. When the investment amounts were known for a several-year
period, they were linearly annualized to allow a yearly calculation.

143.	 Data verification. To ensure that yearly funding matches yearly spending, data verification was performed
for each country. If a discrepancy was noticed between total funding and total spending in a specific country, an
adjustment would be made mainly on transfers or investment values, since these data have been linearly annualized
for the purpose of the yearly calculation. But they actually do vary from one year to the other.

D.	Affordability calculation
144.	 Affordability analysis, using existing expenditure on water and sanitation. Expenditure for water and
wastewater services are reported in some household surveys, as shown in Table 14, above. Other household
surveys (EU SILC and most of the HBSs) report these expenditures together with other utility expenditure or rental
costs. Subsequently, the share of these expenditures in total income was computed and compared to benchmarks
(that is, 5 percent, 3 percent) commonly applied to assess affordability (as outlined in more detail in Fankhauser
and Tepic as in 2005). Since some households did not respond to this question, and since the sample size for
persons living on $2.50 a day PPP is already small, estimates with too few observations and corresponding large
standard errors were not reported.

145.	 Affordability analysis, using assumed minimum water consumption and average tariff, as collected through
SoS data collection. Using a potential minimum water consumption of 100 liters per capita per day and average
tariff for water and wastewater collection, the average expenditure per person was calculated for each household,
taking into consideration household size, and computed as share in total income, estimated from the household
surveys. This scenario assumes that all households would be covered with public water and wastewater services in
the country under equal conditions and without taking into consideration differences in price and income elasticities.
This hypothetical scenario provides an upper benchmark of potential affordability constraints, should full coverage of
services be pursued.




E.	Water Services Sustainability Assessment
146.	 The State of the Sector study looks at many different dimensions of water and wastewater services; those are
discussed in details in each of this report’s chapters. In the concluding part of the report, the team consolidated those
various dimensions into an overall services sustainability assessment to evaluate how close each country was to
being able to provide sustainable services for all. In that context, sustainability was understood to include access to
infrastructure, quality of services provided, their efficiency, and the financing framework in place to provide financially
sound yet affordable services. The services sustainability assessment combines those four dimensions and the
underlying numerical indicators into an overall value. It is based exclusively on sector outcome indicators and does
not consider the way the sector is organized or structured.

147.	 Services sustainability assessment construction. The services sustainability assessment was constructed
from four dimensions (access, quality, efficiency, and financing), each measured through three indicators (Table
18). For each indicator, the regional best practice value (higher bound) has been defined by using expert opinion
and analysis of the existing data (see Table 17); the lowest bound has generally been defined as the lowest possible
value. The sustainability of a particular country is then assessed on the basis of a linear relationship between this
lower and higher bound. Each indicator is weighted equally in the overall index calculation and simply added to
obtain the overall value.

148.	 Assessment in case of missing information. For some countries, not all 12 indicators are available. When a
given indicator is missing, its value is assumed to be the average of all the other indicators. However, all countries
have at least 75 percent of the necessary information available, and most have 100 percent.

149.	 Assessment robustness and validation. The water sector assessment is a simple aggregation of the sector
outcomes along different dimensions. An extensive review of similar aggregated assessment initiatives, such as the
World Bank’s Doing Business, the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, the Gallup Well-Being Index,
or the Times’ World University Rankings, was conducted prior to developing the proposed services sustainability
assessment. Many if not most of those use simple additive aggregation methods and simple weights. As a
consequence, the sustainability assessment is aligned with international practices, and its simple and transparent
construction ensures easy understanding and replicability. At the same time, it is clear that any such effort will have
limitations in terms of the comparability and oversimplification of policy messages; for example, countries facing
significantly higher rural population, such as Moldova or Romania, are somewhat penalized because of the usually
much lower level of piped water in rural areas.
