EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Introduction

The largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide, including Mexico, is the combustion of fossil
fuels. In Mexico, in 2010, approximately 80% of CO2 emissions originated from the combustion of
fossil fuels1. Mexico´s National Emissions Inventory2, published in 2015 and based on data from
2013, indicates that Mexican greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2013 amounted to 665 Mt CO2
eq. Of this, 75%, or 499 Mt, are CO2 emissions.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is looked at as a potential way to contribute to the
reduction of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, while meeting the growing demand for energy.
Mexico is exploring the possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions associated with this increased demand
for electricity to reduce GHG emissions by 50% below 2002 levels by 2050. In parallel with the
exploration of renewable energy sources for electricity generation, Mexico is considering
technologies such as the carbon capture, utilization and storage of CO2. Mexico is particularly
interested in the enhanced recovery of oil through the injection of CO2 in view of the large potential
for secondary and tertiary hydrocarbon extraction in the country.


Objectives of the study: the importance of a sound regulatory framework for CCUS
projects

The 2014 Roadmap for CCUS is an important step towards the implementation of CCUS projects in
Mexico. This study intends to provide an in-depth assessment of the regulatory framework in
Mexico and to identify necessary modifications for the implementation of the pilot and
demonstration projects set out in the Roadmap, especially in view of the recent changes in the
overall framework for energy policy in Mexico.

In 2010, the CO2 Capture Project (CCP), a partnership of major energy companies who work
together to advance CCS technologies, stressed the need for robust and clear regulatory frameworks
for CCS projects with a view to ensure long term legal certainty and comprehensiveness of the
regulatory frameworks. In addition to these considerations, the development of a clear, robust and
environmentally sound regulatory framework is of essential importance to ensure public support for
CCS projects in a country.

The assessment of detailed regulatory issues in this report should thus provide a sound basis for the
Mexican government in developing and adapting its regulatory framework for each of the key
issues of a CCS project. This report aims at formulating recommendations for modifying the legal
framework in Mexico with a view to allow for the deployment of these activities in such
circumstances.

A regulatory framework for CCUS activities should cover a wide range of aspects. The CCUS chain
covers several very different, though closely connected, activities which require an integral
approach. Nevertheless, some aspects of CCUS activities are very similar to other existing activities
and could be covered to a large extent by existing legal provisions. Other aspects of CCUS are

likely to be unaddressed in existing laws and regulations and will require being developed. This is,
for instance, the case for the monitoring and liability requirements when transitioning from
enhanced oil recovery activities using CO2 to a permanent storage site. It is important to capture the
entire CCUS chain in a regulatory framework for several reasons, from limiting gaps in the legal
framework, in particular for issues such as ownership and liabilities, to enabling the effective and
environmentally sound implementation of CCUS projects.

A sound regulatory framework for CCUS activities should enable the deployment of the projects
envisaged in Mexico in both the short and longer term with a view to giving these activities a place
in the action plan to tackle CO2 emissions from stationary sources in the country, while providing
the necessary guarantees from a perspective of public health, environmental protection as well as
for the investors in such activities.

Scope of the analysis and methodological approach

A systematic approach was followed for the review of international best practices and of the
Mexican regulatory framework for CCUS activities, to identify possible gaps and barriers, and,
ultimately, to develop recommendations. At the outset of the project, tables were developed
following a similar structure, with a view to ensure a structured and coherent approach to the
analysis. A list of key issues to be covered in the review was prepared, with the intention of
ensuring the comprehensiveness of the analysis. The list was developed on the basis of the key
issues in the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework and then completed with additional issues
which the team considered useful to review. Special attention was paid during the analysis to the
regulatory approaches taken for specific issues in each of the countries as well as to the regulatory
context.

The list groups the key issues in the lifecycle of a CCS project into five main categories. One first
category covers general overarching issues, which could be applicable to several phases of the CCS
project. A second category deals specifically with CO2 capture, a third with CO2 transport and a
fourth with CO2 storage and usage. A fifth category covers environmental and health and safety
requirements applicable to all stages in a CCS project. It captures, for instance, pollution prevention
requirements, environmental impact assessments applicable to CCS projects or the mechanisms in
place to protect human health and workers´ safety.

The list of key issues was developed and agreed upon during the inception meeting.

The potential gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory framework for CCUS activities were
assessed against international best regulatory practices and in view of regulatory models, and
subsequently prioritized on the basis of a set of criteria. The list of international best regulatory
practices and models was developed jointly by the project team and the client.

It covers the regulation of CCUS activities in a number of countries that have already developed
comprehensive regulatory frameworks for CCS activities. These countries were selected on the
basis of, for example, proximity, similarity in the legal frameworks or activities in the countries, or
because they are considered as leading best practices in regulating such activities. The countries
selected for an in-depth review on this basis were Australia, Canada, the United States and the
European Union. Domestic circumstances were considered as they provide important contextual
information on the approach taken towards regulating each of the key issues. This allows distilling
similarities and differences when identifying good regulatory practices for the regulatory
framework for CCUS in Mexico.

On the other hand, the in-depth assessment of best regulatory practices covered international model
policies for CCS activities. These are regulatory models or detailed checklists developed by
international organizations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) or research institutes.
These models are considered as comprehensive checklists of all aspects of the CCS chain which
should be covered by regulatory frameworks.

The current report is the final report submitted in the framework of this study. It presents the in-
depth assessment of the international legal framework for CCUS activities, covering regulatory best
practices and international regulatory models, as well as the existing regulatory framework for
CCUS activities in Mexico. These reviews provided a basis an identification and prioritization of
gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory framework and the development of recommendations
regulatory changes.

The existing regulatory framework for CCUS in Mexico


The 2013 Energy Reform

In December 2013, a Constitutional Reform substantially modified the structure of the energy
industry in Mexico, as well as the environmental provisions related to the oil sector. Prior to this
reform, the primary activities of the energy sector were reserved to the Mexican State and exercised
through state-affiliated entities (i.e. PEMEX and CFE.), and the protection of the environment was
mainly attributed to SEMARNAT and its organisms PROFEPA and CONAGUA.

On 30 April 2014, secondary legislation initiatives were presented to the Congress in order to
enable the implementation of the Constitutional Reform approved on 20 December 2013. During
the months following the presentation of the initiatives, the Mexican Congress signed into law
different legislative packages, opening the door for the Federal Executive to create several entities
(such as the Mexican Agency for Security, Energy and Environment, ASEA) and empower other
entities (such as CNH and CRE) to apply the enacted regulation. The Energy Reform provided for
the issuance and publication of nine new laws which were published in the Official Gazette of the
Federation on August 11, 2014.

The regulatory framework for CCUS

The Mexican legal system is a civil law system, with the Constitution, laws issued by the Congress
of the Union and international treaties are the main sources of law. Case law is secondary and
subordinated to statutory law. The different levels of the Mexican executive branch are entitled to
issue several regulations to specify and develop the provisions established in the Constitutional and
Secondary Laws. Mexican Official Standards (or “NOMs”, from the Spanish Normas Oficiales
Mexicanas) regulate specific aspects, such as technical standards, security standards, measurement
processes and environmental prohibitions, among others in a legally binding manner.

Within the Mexican legal system, very few legal requirements explicitly apply to CCUS activities
in Mexico. This can be explained by the early stages of development of such activities in the
country. As a result of the 2013 Constitutional amendment and the secondary legislation adopted in
2014, however, for the first time, general regulatory requirements for some CCUS activities were
introduced in the Mexican legal framework for energy together with other legal requirements for
clean energy.

The Hydrocarbons Law foresees the injection of CO2 into depleting oil reservoirs to recover
additional oil beyond what would have been recovered by conventional drilling, referred to as
enhanced oil recovery. Additionally, the Energy Reform established a National Agency for
Industrial Security and Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector (ASEA) as the
authority entitled to inspect and control activities in the hydrocarbons sector, including EOR
through CCUS projects. On the basis of Article 5°, section XIX of the ASEA Law, ASEA is
expected to issue new guidelines and rules on EOR in the following months.

                                                                                                   8
Nevertheless, relevant environmental requirements for aspects of a CCUS project can also be found
in the existing framework for infrastructure and energy projects, as stated in the General Law on
Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (“LGEEPA”) . The General Law on Climate
Change establishes the legal framework for climate change mitigation in Mexico, including, among
others, the establishment of the Mexican National Emissions Inventory of GHG and associated
reporting obligations, which although not specifically referring to CCUS activities, will be mostly
relevant. Finally, the Law on Electricity Industry introduces the use of clean energy certificates for
the production of clean energy, in which the issuance of certificates for CO2 capture is considered.

There are some other aspects of CCUS projects that are protected under present regulations. For
instance, environmental permits, such as the Environmental Impact Authorization and the Sole
Environmental License would be required for CCUS activities. Preferential rights regarding
superficial occupation and right of way of the hydrocarbons sector are also provided for in the
Hydrocarbons Law, and should be considered important tools for CCUS projects, where the
projects are related with energy generation or with the oil sector. Other preferential rights are
included in several other areas of law.

Recommendations for the Mexican regulatory framework for CCUS

The gap and barrier analysis and associated prioritization showed there is an important distinction to
be made in the Mexican regulatory framework between those CCUS activities that will take place in
or are related to the hydrocarbons sector and activities outside of this sector. The distinction is
particularly relevant for Mexico as activities in the hydrocarbons sector are regulated differently
from those in other areas such as aquifers or depleted mines.

As mentioned above, there is currently no regulatory framework for CCUS specifically in Mexico.
However, the revised Hydrocarbons Law provides the Mexican Agency for Industrial Security,
Energy and the Environment (ASEA) with the authority to regulate the generation, capture,
transportation and storage of CO2 within the hydrocarbons sector. No such legal basis currently
exists for other CCUS activities outside of this sector. However, it was also noted that certain other
aspects of CCUS activities, such as those related to the capture of CO2, could be covered by existing
regulation. Finally, consideration could be given to modifying existing legislation with a view to
explicitly include CCUS activities within their scope.

The development of recommendations is structured around the main categories of key issues used
throughout the report. Recommendations therefore distinguish between the regulatory aspects of
capture activities, transport, storage and several overarching regulatory issues relevant to all of
these activities that are part of the CCUS chain. The organization of recommendations in
accordance with these types of activities follows the nature of the regulatory framework in Mexico
and in other jurisdictions. Capture, transport and storage are often regulated in separate legal
instruments, though cross-referring to each other. The recommendations moreover provide
suggestions for amending existing legal requirements or for the development of new instruments,
mostly in the form of regulations or guidelines.

The initial outline for these recommendations was presented during the stakeholder workshop held
in Mexico City on September 24th 2015. While most stakeholders agreed on the approach towards
regulating capture and transport, different views were expressed in relation to the regulation of
storage activities, especially outside of the hydrocarbons sector. Also in relation to property rights,
different opinions were expressed by stakeholders. These opinions are reflected throughout the
report.

                                                                                                     9
CO2 capture and transport

Most aspects related to the capture side of CCUS activities seem adequately covered by the existing
regulatory framework consisting of the LGEEPA. There is currently no explicit authorization
procedure for CO2 capture activities in Mexico. Nevertheless, a sole environmental license is
required under the LGEEPA for all stationary industrial facilities. Such license would cover CO2
capture aspects as part of the general permitting requirements for such installations, for instance, for
electricity plants.

However, not all installations subject to a sole environmental license are required to monitor and
report on their emissions. The monitoring and reporting requirements ultimately depend on whether
an installation is considered a source under federal or local jurisdiction. Monitoring requirements
under the General Law on Climate Change, which would be applicable to installations proceeding
with the capture of CO2 emissions, currently only cover installations generating more than 25,000
metric tons of CO2. It is, therefore, recommended to amend the monitoring requirements of the
General Law on Climate Change, as established in the Regulation on the emissions inventory, and
extend their scope to installations emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2. This would ensure a
coherent approach to the monitoring requirements for all industrial installations proceeding with the
capture of CO2.

Moreover, the Energy Reform has modified the regulatory competencies for activities in the
hydrocarbons sector. In relation to capture this means that capture activities in industrial plants in
the hydrocarbons sector, such as refineries or petrochemical installations, would have to be
regulated by means of new regulations by ASEA. MRV requirements for new installations in this
sector will need to be developed by ASEA in the form of guidelines.

In relation to CO2 transport, legislative changes may be needed to enable the transport of CO2,
either through the expansion of existing legal requirements or the development of a new legal basis.
There is currently no specific regulation for CO2 transport either via pipeline, road, railroad or sea
transport. However, existing regulations for the transport of natural gas via pipelines and for the
transport of materials, hazardous materials and hazardous waste via other means of transport, could
be amended or serve as an example for the broad regulatory framework for CO2 transport. Specific
operational conditions for the transport of CO2, such as temperature or volume requirements as well
as monitoring requirements could be adopted by means of implementing regulations as has been
done in other jurisdictions.

The regulation of CO2 transport in relation to the hydrocarbons sector would, similarly to the above,
be a competence of ASEA since the Energy Reform. As a consequence, the authorization for
transport of CO2 can be regulated by ASEA in the guidelines for CCUS activities in the
hydrocarbons sector.

CO2 Storage Activities in the Hydrocarbon Sector

The regulation of CO2 storage in the hydrocarbon sector is particularly relevant for the pilot projects
currently envisaged in Mexico, which would consist of a CO2-EOR project managed by PEMEX at
its Cinco Presidentes site, as well as for any later storage activities in the hydrocarbons sector.

The issue of long-term storage of CO2 could be dealt with by the treatment of CO2 as a hazardous
waste, similarly to the classification used for such activities in Canada. The mixture of a hazardous
waste (irrespectively of the concentration of waste in the stream) with any other material would

                                                                                                     10
render such material a hazardous waste and consequently be subject to regulations on hazardous
wastes. Such treatment would have the following advantages: (i) it would require no modifications
of federal environmental impact matters as LGEEPA article 28 currently includes the obligation to
go through the environmental impact evaluation for hazardous waste confinements; (ii) the General
Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes (LGPGIR), its Regulations and Official
Mexican Standard NOM-145-SEMARNAT-2003 already include the possibility to confine
hazardous wastes in geologically stable sites; (iii) there are mechanisms already in place in the
aforementioned law for the monitoring and verification of such site confinements; (iv)
SEMARNAT must issue a specific permit (apart from the environmental impact authorization) for
the confinement of hazardous wastes. However, during the stakeholder workshop organized in
Mexico City to discuss the regulatory options, issues were raised by some stakeholders, in particular
regarding the reaction of the general public and NGOs when considering CO2 as a hazardous waste
and the administrative burden comprised with the LGPGIR, which project developers would have to
comply with.

The option could be considered for the pilot projects as these provisions regulate long-term storage
and would thus be able to be used to authorize the long-term storage of CO2 in a relatively short
timeframe. It should be noted that, in this case, implementing regulations would require being
adopted regulating the composition of the CO2 stream or the composition of the hazardous waste
mixture that is allowed for the operation to be considered a CCUS operation.

If a decision is made not to consider CO2 as a hazardous waste only for storage purposes, an
alternative option in the existing regulatory framework could possibly consist of ASEA including in
the ASEA Regulations on CCUS-EOR matters all matters related to the storage of CO2 in EOR
activities or any other activity in the hydrocarbon sector that will involve storage of CO 2 as part of
such activity, including permanent storage. Alternatively, SEMARNAT could be granted with the
entitlement to permit the long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO2 storage,
through an amendment of the LGEEPA, including a new chapter on CCUS activities, long-term
storage and corresponding regulations.

Even in those cases, if permanent storage can be considered as part of a hydrocarbon activity, an
issue related to the use of the land would still need to be resolved. Permanent storage activities
would require MRV for a long-term period beyond sealing the storage site, which would need the
approval from the title owner of such land. For such matters, in order to avoid any conflicts with the
title owner, in case of permanent storage, it would be recommended to amend the existing
Hydrocarbons Law or to include specifications in the ASEA Regulations, in order to clearly define
that for permanent storage activities, a permanent right of way or expropriation of the land will be
needed.

CO2 Storage Activities outside of the Hydrocarbon Sector

Regarding longer-term demonstration and commercial-scale projects that are not located in or
related to the hydrocarbons sector and hence not subject to ASEA CCUS Regulations (when
issued), the option of storing CO2 as hazardous waste could be considered, similarly to the situation
described for activities in the hydrocarbons sector. Existing legal provisions that regulate such
activities would not require amending or the adoption of new legislation. Strict implementing
regulations on the composition of the hazardous waste mixture and allowed concentrations of such
waste would have to be established by means of implementing regulations, similarly to what is done
in other jurisdictions on the composition of the CO2 stream, whereby maximum concentrations of
impurities are legally established.


                                                                                                    11
In case the storage of CO2 as a hazardous waste is not considered a viable option, the LGEEPA,
which operates as the general framework on environmental matters, could be amended to regulate
CCUS activities. More precisely, inclusion of an additional chapter regulating permanent storage
aspects, including temporary and permanent storage, liability aspects and other issues not covered
by existing legislation, would be required. Furthermore, an amendment to the First Title, Chapter
IV, Section V and the corresponding section of the Regulations would be required to include CCUS
activities subject to environmental impact evaluation (in particular for permanent storage).

Likewise, the long-term use of the subsurface of the land where the CO2 is being permanently
stored needs to be regulated. As the issue is essentially one of environmental protection or
greenhouse gasses reduction, SEMARNAT could be granted with the entitlement to permit the
long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO2 storage, through an amendment of the
LGEEPA, including a new chapter on CCUS activities, long-term storage and corresponding
regulations. Such amendment could also be used for CCUS-EOR activities.

Long-Term Liability for CCUS activities

The manner in which liability (in particular long-term liability) has been treated in most of the
reviewed legislative frameworks is similar. In most cases, subject to certain conditions, the liability
is transferred to the appointed state authority after a certain period of time.

However, in the current Mexican regulatory framework environmental liability has a statute of
limitations of 12 years as of the environmental damage or its effects, which would render the statute
of limitations “without limitation” and there is certainly no transfer of liability or in the case of
hazardous wastes 20 years after closure of confinement activities of hazardous wastes. If the pilot
projects were to be set in motion by a government authority other than PEMEX or CFE this
recommendation would not be relevant as it would be the government that is and remains liable.
However, with the new regime under which PEMEX and CFE operate a permanent liability, a
heavy burden would be placed on those operators. Similarly, in other jurisdictions reviewed as part
of this study, a transfer of responsibility for the consequences of permanent storage operations has
been established following compliance with strict conditions by the operator, who must demonstrate
that all necessary measures have been taken with a view to ensure the storage site is permanently
sealed and no leakages have occurred. As such, it would be recommended to amend the LGEEPA
(in what would be the CCUS chapter) modifying the liability period stated in the Federal
Environmental Responsibility Law, exclusively for CCUS activities, and stating the time period and
conditions under which the liability transfer is made to SEMARNAT.

Environmental Protection and Climate Change Mitigation

Finally, the report recommends that additional regulatory changes be made in Mexico from an
overarching or supporting nature for the deployment of CCUS activities.

An extension of the LGEEPA that aims to apply the requirements for environmental impact
assessments would enhance environmental protection and prior detection of potential environmental
risks associated with a specific project as well as ensure the engagement of the public in decision-
making on the projects.

It is also recommended that the Mexican regulatory framework for climate change mitigation be
enhanced to provide incentives for CCUS activities as part of climate mitigation strategies. While
still insufficient or not operational, several initiatives are currently underway to provide concrete
incentives for the deployment of CCUS activities. The further operationalization of the Mexican

                                                                                                    12
carbon market coupled with emission performance standards or emission limitations could provide
such incentives.

INTRODUCTION


Carbon dioxide capture, utilization and geological storage (CCUS) is a set of technologies that aims
to contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing the emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere. It
consists of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial installations, its transport to a
storage site via pipeline and its injection into a suitable underground geological formation for
permanent storage. Suitable underground formations may consist of deep saline aquifers, un-
mineable coal seams or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. One particular technology, Enhanced Oil
Recovery (EOR) involves the injection of CO2 in oil fields to increase the amount of crude oil to be
recovered from an oil field. Although EOR-CO2 is a technology that has been utilized for several
decades, it is only considered a form of permanent storage of CO2 under certain circumstances. In
other situations, a series of efforts are in progress for transitioning from EOR-CO2 operations to
permanent storage3. Until now, EOR has been the main form of utilization of industrial CO2 and it
is also the reason for the “U” introduced in the CCUS acronym, formerly named CCS only.

           In the context of carbon capture and storage, a range of abbreviations are used,
           representing groups of technologies. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to the
           process whereby CO2 is captured, transported and stored permanently in geological
           formations. Carbon capture and utilization or use (CCU) covers the set of technologies
           whereby CO2 is captured and used in a variety of applications. This includes, for
           instance, the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery or for industrial use. Finally, carbon
           capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as referred to in this report, covers all of the
           above activities. Often, the term CCS is however also used to refer to utilization
           activities. In this report, we will follow the abbreviations as introduced above.
           However, when an official instance uses another abbreviation, (for example, the
           legislation dealing with utilization in Australia only refers to CCS), we will use the
           abbreviations as used officially by the authorities.

The largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide, including Mexico, is the combustion of fossil
fuels. In Mexico, in 2010, approximately 80% of CO2 emissions originated from the combustion of
fossil fuels4. Mexico´s National Emissions Inventory5, published in 2015 and based on data from
2013, indicates that Mexican greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2013 amounted to 665 Mt CO2
eq. Of this, 75%, or 499 Mt, are CO2 emissions.

The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) are a mechanism in which countries
publicly outline which climate actions are intended to be taken after 2020. In the case of Mexico,
the INDC6 is composed of a mitigation and an adaptation strategy. The mitigation component
includes two types of measures: unconditional emission reduction and conditional reduction. The
unconditional reduction is designed to reduce greenhouse gases by at least 25% by the year 2030,
while the conditional reduction implies that the 25% initially stated can increase up to 40% subject

to a global agreement on climate change7. In both scenarios, CCS and CCUS projects can be
considered to contribute to the achievement of these targets.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is looked at as a potential way to contribute to the
reduction of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, while meeting the growing demand for energy.
Mexico is particularly interested in the enhanced recovery of oil through the injection of CO 2 in
view of the large potential for secondary and tertiary hydrocarbon extraction in the country. .For the
effective implementation of CCUS pilot and demonstration projects, there is not only a need for a
thorough understanding of the technical and environmental aspects associated with these
technologies, but also for robust and reliable regulatory frameworks. In 2012, a first general
assessment of the legal and regulatory framework for CCUS activities in Mexico took place under
the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)8.

The current Study intends to provide a comprehensive in-depth assessment of the regulatory
framework to provide the necessary modifications for the implementation of the pilot and
demonstration projects set out in the Roadmap, especially in view of recent modifications in the
overall framework for energy policy in Mexico. The Study will therefore build on the general
assessment carried out for APEC in 2012, update and deepen the analysis and develop
recommendations for overcoming critical gaps and barriers in the existing regulatory framework.

The current report is the final report submitted in the framework of this study. In Chapter 2, the
report will present the in-depth assessment of the international legal framework for CCUS activities,
covering regulatory best practices and international regulatory models. Chapter 3 presents the
existing regulatory framework for CCUS activities in Mexico. Annex I to this report contains the
detailed assessment tables for the international review.

These reviews provided a basis for the following chapters of this report, namely an identification
and prioritization of gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory framework and the development of
recommendations regulatory changes.

Chapter 4 identifies gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory framework. These gaps and
barriers are subsequently prioritized according to a list of prioritization criteria in Chapter 5.
Finally, Chapter 6 presents recommendations for modifications to the regulatory framework for
CCUS activities in Mexico.

1       OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH


During the inception phase of the project, we developed tables following a similar structure for the
review of international best practices and the review of the Mexican regulatory framework for
CCUS activities. Each table listed the key issues for the assessment agreed upon during the
inception meeting. This ensures that a structured and coherent approach is followed for the review
of all international best practices, as well as for the review of the regulatory framework for such
activities in Mexico.

A regulatory framework for CCUS activities should cover a wide range of regulatory aspects. The
CCUS chain covers several very different, though closely connected, activities which require a
comprehensive and consistent approach. Some aspects of CCUS are very similar to existing
activities and could be covered to a large extent by existing legal provisions. This is, for example,
the case for CO2 transport. While very few countries have legal provisions dealing with the
transport of CO2 specifically, many have a legal framework in place for the transport of other
gaseous substances. In a number of countries, such provisions have been applied to CO2 transport.
Other aspects of CCUS are likely to be unaddressed in existing laws and regulations and will
require being developed. This is, for instance, the case for the monitoring and liability requirements
when transitioning from enhanced oil recovery activities using CO2 to a permanent storage site.

It is important to capture the entire CCUS chain in a regulatory framework for several reasons, from
limiting gaps in the legal framework, in particular for issues such as ownership and liabilities, to
enabling the effective and environmentally sound implementation of CCUS projects. A sound
regulatory framework for CCUS activities should enable the deployment of the projects envisaged
in Mexico in both the short and longer term with a view to giving these activities a place in the
action plan to tackle CO2 emissions from stationary sources in the country, while providing the
necessary guarantees from a perspective of public health, environmental protection as well as for
the investors in such activities.

In 2010, the CO2 Capture Project (CCP), a partnership of major energy companies who work
together to advance CCS technologies, again stressed the need for robust and clear regulatory
frameworks for CCS projects with a view to ensure long term legal certainty and
comprehensiveness of the regulatory frameworks9. A report by the CCP notes that regulatory
frameworks still have important unresolved issues and noted that progress should be made in
developing regulatory frameworks that ensure that:
     Licensing and permitting procedures do not present unnecessary delays to CCS deployment
        while providing adequate assurance that the sites approved are safe and secure
     All regulatory requirements for CCS projects should be agreed by all government entities
        and clearly communicated
     Unresolved issues on long-term liability, transfer of responsibility and financial securities
        do not create major risks to commercial investment
     The development of regulatory frameworks does not give rise to unaligned policy-making
        leading to uncertainty.

In addition to these considerations, the development of a comprehensive, robust and
environmentally sound regulatory framework is of essential importance to ensure public support for
CCS projects in a country. The comprehensive assessment of detailed regulatory issues in this
report should thus provide a sound basis for the Mexican government in developing and adapting its

regulatory framework for each of the key issues of a CCS project.

The list of key issues covered in the review with the intention of ensuring the comprehensiveness of
the analysis and to allow us to differentiate among countries and their regulatory approaches to
specific issues, was developed on the basis of the key issues identified in the IEA CCS Model
Regulatory Framework. This list was then completed with additional issues which the team
considered useful to review. The list groups the key issues in the lifecycle of a CCS project into five
main categories. One first category covers general overarching issues, which could be applicable to
several phases of the CCS project. It deals, for instance, with property rights, the classification of
CO2 under national legislation and the implications of this, and national incentives for CCS. A
second category deals specifically with CO2 capture, a third with CO2 transport and a fourth with
CO2 storage and usage. A fifth category covers environmental and health and safety requirements
applicable to all stages in a CCS project. It captures, for instance, pollution prevention
requirements, environmental impact assessments applicable to CCS projects or the mechanisms in
place to protect human health and workers´ safety.

The following list of key issues was developed and agreed upon during the inception meeting.

The tables were subsequently populated with the main aspects of the regulatory framework for each
key issue in each of the regulatory frameworks or model policies covered by the assessment. An
introduction to the instruments covered is included in the corresponding chapter. The information
was gathered from studies, academic publications, legal instruments in the jurisdictions covered and
publications from international organizations. The completed tables are included in Annex I to this
report.

A horizontal assessment of best regulatory practices and models for each of the key issues is set out
in Chapter 2 of this report.

Subsequently, the same exercise was carried out for the existing Mexican regulatory framework.
The legal requirements potentially applicable or relevant for each of the key issues are presented in
a table following the same format and order. The results of this review are presented in Chapter 3.

During the next step of this project, a gap and barrier analysis will be prepared for the existing
Mexican regulatory framework. This analysis will identify those key issues which are inadequately,
or not yet, addressed in the Mexican legal framework with a view to providing the sound regulatory
framework required for CCUS activities in Mexico. It will also identify potential obstacles in the
Mexican framework to the successful deployment of CCUS projects. The gaps and barriers will be
prioritized in view of the planned CCUS projects in Mexico in the coming years.

2    REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES FOR REGULATING CCUS
     ACTIVITIES


As a first step in the review, we have examined the regulation of CCUS activities in a number of
countries that have already developed comprehensive regulatory frameworks for CCS activities.
These countries have been selected on the basis of, for example, proximity, similarity in the legal
frameworks or activities in the countries, or because they are considered as leading best practices in
regulating such activities. The countries selected for an in-depth review on this basis were Australia,
Canada, the United States and the European Union.

On the other hand, the in-depth assessment of best regulatory practices in this report covers
international model policies for CCS activities. These are regulatory models or detailed checklists
developed by international organizations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) or
research institutes. These models are considered as comprehensive checklists of all aspects of the
CCS chain which should be covered by regulatory frameworks.

The potential gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory framework for CCUS activities will be
assessed against such international best regulatory practices and in view of the regulatory models in
Chapter 4.

The Terms of reference for this study identified a number of regulatory instruments and models to
be covered by this review. The list from the Terms of Reference was completed by Milieu. For
example, in the European Union, the assessment of the legal framework also covers additional
Directives, such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (which regulates the capture of CO 2 in the
EU) and the Water Framework Directive. The team also considered a number of articles published
in the UCL Legal Programme on carbon capture and storage as they were considered particularly
useful for the topics under review in this study.

Legal and regulatory instruments covered by the review:
    Victorian Greenhouse Gas Geological Sequestration Act (2008), and related regulations;
    European Union Directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide (2009), and any
       other relevant legislation, such as the EU Directive on industrial emissions, the Water
       Framework Directive and the Waste Framework Directive.
    Alberta Carbon Capture and Storage Regulatory Framework Assessment (2013);
    Legal framework in the United States through the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Air
       Act

Model policies covered by the review:
   IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework (2010);
   Global CCS Institute: CCS Regulatory Reviews ‒ Scotland (2010), Trinidad and
       Tobago(2012), Romania(2012);
   IEA CCS Legal and Regulatory Reviews - 4th Edition, January 2014.
   Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission’s (IOGCC) publication on Carbon Geologic
       Storage (2008) and related reports;
   UCL Legal Programme article contributions
Our review of international best practices covers all key issues of the CCS chain. We have aimed at
providing a comprehensive assessment of those issues that are particularly relevant when

                                                                                                    21
developing a legal framework for CCUS activities, covering general aspects, including, for example
the regulation of property rights, the composition of the CO2 stream and overall applicable legal
frameworks as well as more specific legal aspects associated with the various phases of a CCUS
project. We clearly distinguished between the CO2 capture phase, which is closely related to
legislation on atmospheric emissions and industrial installations, CO2 transport infrastructure and
permitting, storage-related aspects, such as permitting requirements and liability, and legal issues
related with the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. Finally, we also considered legislation
dealing with the environmental and health impacts of such activities.

Overall introduction to legal and regulatory developments worldwide: Global CCS Status
2014

The 2014 report on the Global Status of CCS10 includes important notes on the development of the
legal and regulatory frameworks for CCUS worldwide. These notes provide a general assessment of
the progress made in developing adequate regulatory frameworks for CCUS and identify important
gaps and barriers from an international perspective. The report, for instance, includes the results of
the GCCSI 2014 Perceptions Survey which highlighted that only modest progress is perceived in
the development of legal and regulatory frameworks supportive of CCUS activities. The report also
contains two interesting conclusions on international regulatory barriers to the effective deployment
of CCUS activities. Firstly, it notes that only a few countries have proceeded with the ratification of
the amendment to Article 6 of the London Protocol11. The London Protocol to the London
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was
amended in 2006 and 2009 with a view to removing obstacles to the transboundary movement of
CO2 when considered as waste. As stated in the report: “Article 6 prohibits the export of waste, thus
effectively prohibiting the movement of CO2 across marine borders.” An amendment to Article 6
which explicitly allows for the export of CO2 for the purpose of geological storage and thus
essential for transboundary CCUS projects, has however, not yet been ratified by a sufficient
majority for its entry into force. Secondly, the report also identifies those areas of the CCUS chain
which are considered mostly unaddressed by respondents to the 2014 Perceptions Survey. In all
jurisdictions covered by the analysis, there are still issues relating to transboundary movement, the
inclusion of CCUS in market mechanisms and liability, which are often criticized as being
insufficiently addressed by legal frameworks.

2.1    FRAMEWORK FOR CCUS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS: GENERAL FEATURES

Several countries have developed regulatory frameworks for the implementation of CCUS activities
in their territory and have started implementing the first pilot and demonstration projects. These
regulatory frameworks can provide useful insights and guidance for other countries aiming to
establish or adapt their laws and regulations to enable such activities in their territory, especially in
view of the complexity of CCUS from a regulatory point of view, covering very distinct activities in
different stages of development, some of which might somehow be captured by existing legislation
while others might require a new framework. This chapter aims at distilling best practices from the
international experience that has been built up in recent years.
It is important to note and take account of the different legal traditions and context in each of these
other jurisdictions. For example, whether a country has a civil or common law tradition will have an
impact on their approach to regulating CCUS. The same applies for the legal and political system in
a country, for example, whether the country follows a more centralized regulatory approach or is a

federation with large competencies for subnational states or decentralized entities. While such
domestic circumstances provide important contextual information that shall be taken into
consideration during the following tasks of this project, the approach towards regulating each of the
key issues will allow to distill similarities, differences and good regulatory practices that can be
used when identifying the main gaps and obstacles in the existing regulatory framework in Mexico
for CCUS activities. The following subsections provide an introduction to the regulation of CCUS
in each of the jurisdictions carefully assessed below. A more detailed assessment of each of the key
issues is provided in the following chapter.

2.1.1    CCS in the European Union: general regulatory features

The environmentally safe geological storage of CO2 is regulated in the European Union (EU) in
Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide (hereinafter called CCS
Directive)12. The CCS Directive is applicable to all CO2 storage in geological formations in the
territory of the EU (onshore and offshore) and covers all stages of CO2 storage (from the selection
of a site, through exploration and operation phases to the post-closure period). The CCS Directive
also regulates certain aspects of the capture and transport of CO2; however, these activities are
mainly covered by other pieces of EU environmental legislation. Before the CCS Directive was
adopted, the European Commission carried out an impact assessment where possible options for the
regulation of CCS activities in Europe (capture, transport and storage) were analyzed in detail13. It
was concluded that the capture and transport of CO2 is already adequately covered by the existing
EU legislation (in particular Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public
and private projects on the environment (EIA Directive)14 and Directive 2010/75/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (IED)15).
Hence, the adoption of a specific law to cover these two aspects was not found to be necessary. For
this reason, the CCS Directive regulates mainly CO2 storage and amends other pieces of EU
environmental legislation to remove legal barriers to geological storage of CO2. For example, the
Water Framework Directive, the main EU water law, has been amended to exempt CO2 injection for
CCS from certain restrictive provisions in the Directive. For example, the Water Framework
Directive prohibits direct discharges of pollutants into groundwater. The above-mentioned
amendment introduced an exception from this general prohibition by allowing the authorization of
the injection of CO2 stream for storage purposes into geological formations which are permanently
unsuitable for other purposes or which involve the storage of CO2 below 100 metric kilotons. In
addition, other legislation should also be taken into consideration when planning and carrying out
CCS activities in the EU, such as (i) in relation to environmental liability - Directive 2004/35/CE
on environmental liability (ELD)16, (ii) in relation to emission trading - Directive 2003/87/EC
establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (ETS
Directive)17, (iii) with regard to offshore transport and storage - Directive 2008/56/EC establishing a

connection with the protection of nature - Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of
natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive). Moreover, the EU has developed
an extensive framework for occupational health and safety which must also be taken into account
by the operators.

In accordance with the CCS Directive, Member States may allow CO2 storage on their territories
(onshore - whole or in part) as well as in their exclusive economic zones and continental shelves
(offshore – whole or in part), or may totally prohibit CO2 storage. Whereas most Member States
allow geological storage of CO2, some have reported a decision not to allow CO2 storage on their
territory or part of it due to unsuitability of their geology for CO2 storage (Finland, Luxembourg and
the Brussels Capital Region of Belgium). Some other Member States have also not allowed
geological storage of CO2 (Austria, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Slovenia, Sweden) or restricted it
(Czech Republic19, Germany20)21. The CCS Directive does not cover biomass-CCS and enhanced
hydrocarbon recovery. However, the Commission should review the Directive with a view to
examining and assessing the experience with incentives for applying CCS on installations
combusting biomass.

The CCS Directive, as all EU directives, must be transposed into legislation for all 28 Member
States. The Directive sets out goals and results that Member States must achieve. However, it is up
to the individual countries to decide on measures to achieve these goals. This is particularly true for
setting out permitting procedures and establishing competent authorities in individual Member
States. The CCS Directive provides for a permitting procedure for CO2 storage (and the IED and the
EIA Directive for CO2 capture and transport authorizations). Member States must ensure that the
rules stipulated by the directives are transposed into their respective legislations (including e.g.
application content, permit conditions, etc.). However, detailed procedural rules are left for the
discretion of Member States, as long as they comply with EU legislation. Similarly, the CCS
Directive requires Member States to establish, or designate, competent authority or authorities to
fulfil duties stipulated by the Directive. It means that in each Member State, different authorities
will be in charge of obligations arising from the CCS Directive and Member States must ensure that
they are given enough legal powers and human and financial resources to carry out their tasks.
At EU level, there is no authority or body competent for CCS activities, as CCS activities are
authorized, implemented and monitored at national (Member State) level. The European
Commission has certain general competences – it issues non-binding opinions on draft storage
permits and on decisions of approval of the transfer of responsibility issued by national authorities,
it prepares (every three years) a report on the implementation of the Directive on the basis of reports
sent by Member States and transmits it to the European parliament and the Council. In order to
facilitate the transposition and implementation of the CCS Directive in Member States, in March
2001, the European Commission issued four guidance documents; they are mainly addressed to the
competent authorities and to relevant stakeholders. The first guidance document sets out a CO 2
storage life cycle risk management framework, whereas the other three outline issues such as the

2.1.2     CCUS in the United States: general regulatory features

The United States has a federal system of government with important regulatory power for the
states. CCUS projects have been developed often with differences in approach or regulation
depending on the State. However, in 2010, president Obama sent a presidential memorandum to the
heads of 14 Executive Departments and Federal Agencies establishing an Interagency Task Force
                                              .
on Carbon Capture and Storage (ITFCCS)23 The goal was to develop a comprehensive and
coordinated Federal strategy to speed up the commercial development and deployment of CCS
technologies in line with the Administration’s goals of climate protection24. The ITFCCS Task
Force, co-chaired by the Department of Energy (USDOE) and the Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA), was charged with proposing a plan to overcome the barriers to the widespread,
cost-effective deployment of CCS within ten years, with a goal of bringing five to ten commercial
demonstration projects online by 201625.

For implementing the ITDCCS plan, the Federal government worked on the basis of the existing
framework. Regulatory competence for CCUS is shared between national and state entities.
Property rights (onshore and offshore), transportation, pipelines, and incentives are the most
important issues that are regulated by the State governments.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) are the main environmental
federal regulatory instruments regarding the capture and storage of CO2.

Under the authority of the CAA, USEPA finalized greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements
for suppliers of CO2 (including CO2 capture), underground injection, and geologic sequestration of
CO2. Information obtained under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program will enable EPA to track
the amount of carbon dioxide received by these facilities26. The CCA authorizes USEPA to
establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and public
welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Section 111 of the CCA allows
USEPA to developed performance standards for CO2 emissions from new and existing power
plants27. On August 3, 2015, president Obama and USEPA announced the Clean Power Plan for
reducing carbon pollution from power plants28. The Clean Power Plan includes a standard for CO2

   Under Section 111 of CCA, the term ‘‘standard of performance’’ means a standard for emissions of air pollutants which
reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction
which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impact
and energy requirements) the USEPA determines has been adequately demonstrated.

emissions from new, fossil fueled electric plants. New coal-fired power plants will likely need to
capture some portion of potential emissions to meet final federal standards for emissions. While not
required, existing coal and natural gas power plants may pursue CCS to meet state emissions’
targets under the final Clean Power Plan29. In this context, USEPA cites the experience to date in
deploying CCS technology, including the successful launch of the world’s first commercial-scale
CCS power plant by SaskPower in Saskatchewan in 201430.

In 2015, the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI) listed that there are 15 large-
scale CCS projects in operation worldwide and a further seven under construction.31 Of a total of 40
CCS projects which are either operational or an advanced stage of development, near operation, 12
are located in the US. Two industrial CCS projects are expected to become operational, of which
one is located in the US, namely the Illinois Industrial CCS in Decatur, Illinois. It will be the first
integrated CCS project in the US to inject CO2 in a deep saline formation at a large scale. Moreover,
two large-scale capture projects have been set up at power plants in Mississippi and Houston,
Texas.32 In spite of this development, the IEA has labelled the status of CCS as “not on track” .33
MIT identifies at least 15 CCUS projects, on the other hand, which have either been cancelled or
become inactive.34
In addition, USEPA, under authority of the SDWA, has finalized the requirements for geologic
sequestration, including the development of a new class of wells, Class VI, under the authority of
the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program. These requirements
(also known as the Class VI rule) are designed to protect underground sources of drinking water.
The Class VI rule builds on existing UIC Program requirements, with extensive tailored
requirements that address carbon dioxide injection for long-term storage to ensure that wells used
for geologic sequestration are appropriately sited, constructed, tested, monitored, funded, and
closed35. This rule also affords owners, or operators, injection depth flexibility to address injection
in various geological settings in the United States in which geologic sequestration may occur,
including very deep formations and oil and gas fields that are transitioned for use as carbon dioxide
storage sites36. USEPA’s Federal requirements under the UIC Program Wells are now codified in
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations under 40 CFR 146.81 et seq, and are referred to as the Class
VI Rule.

Currently, USEPA is working on a regulation that would clarify how streams of CO2 injected for
geologic sequestration would be classified under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) hazardous waste requirements37. Meanwhile, USDOE has created a nationwide network of

federal, state and private sector partnerships to determine the most suitable technologies,
regulations, and infrastructure for future carbon capture, storage and sequestration in different areas
of the country38. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) manages the CCS Database
that provides the public with information regarding efforts by various industries, public groups, and
governments towards the development and eventual deployment of CCS technology39.

Supported by significant funding from the USDOE, the US has a robust portfolio of large-scale
CCS/CCUS projects. Nearly all projects include CO2-EOR as the preferred storage type, with only
two involving CO2 storage in saline formations. The US legal framework has specific prohibitions
of CCS projects in matters such as fishing, fauna and flora, and navigation.

2.1.3    CCUS in Canada: general regulatory features

Canada has several decades of experience with various components related to CCUS activities
through its activities in the oil and gas sector. Canada has two levels of government: federal and
provincial. The federal government has the ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) which also includes, inter alia, federal
funding for CCUS projects, projects on federal lands, and transboundary projects. The federal
government, through the National Energy Board (NEB), regulates international and interprovincial
aspects of the oil, gas and electric utility industries and has jurisdiction over interprovincial and
international commodity pipelines40. Meanwhile, Environment Canada (EC) regulates international
and interprovincial environmental impacts regarding CCUS such as federal air emissions, climate
change, nature, pollution, etc.

Canada is a party to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes
and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention) and the related 1996 Protocol to the Convention
on the Prevention of Marine Pollution By Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the 1996
Protocol)41. Therefore, Canada is obligated to control the disposal of substances into waters or onto
ice from activities taking place at sea by way of a legislated general prohibition.

In Canada, the Provinces have a substantial amount of the constitutional authority to govern CCUS
activities within their borders42. Especially the Provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and
Saskatchewan have developed a CCUS regulatory framework during the last years based upon their
well regulated oil and gas legal framework. In Saskatchewan, the Boundary Dam Power Station is
the world’s first and largest commercial-scale CCS project of its kind. Boundary Dam is an example
of how carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is improving financial
returns and providing additional resource recovery needed to incentivize CCUS demonstrations in
regions such as North America and the Middle East43.

The case of Alberta is particularly interesting because it has developed a regulatory framework for

CCUS. This process began in 2007, when the Alberta and Federal Governments established the
ecoENERGY Carbon Capture and Storage Task Force (Task Force) with the mandate to provide
advice on how the government and industry can work together to facilitate and support the
development of CCUS opportunities in Canada. This Task Force elaborated a report which
recommended, inter alia, establishing a collaborative advisory group44. Following these
recommendations, in 2008, the provincial government formed the Alberta Carbon Capture and
Storage Development Council (Development Council) which recommended Alberta take concrete
steps to enable CCUS in the province45. In 2009, the Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Act was
passed to encourage and expedite the design, construction, and operation of CCUS projects in
Alberta. In 2010, the Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act amended several key
pieces of legislation, including the Mines and Minerals Act and the Oil and Gas Conservation Act,
and the Oil and Gas Conservation Act.

The Mines and Minerals Act was amended to declare that all pore space, except that under federally
owned lands, is owned by the province. The amendment also enabled the Minister of Energy to
enter into agreements to grant pore space rights and allowed the provincial government to accept
long-term liability for properly sequestered CO246. Also, a Post-Closure Stewardship Fund was
created to ensure that money is available to cover monitoring and potential remediation costs after
the province assumes liability47. The Alberta government assumes long-term liability for storage
sites once the sites have been properly closed and the operators have demonstrated, through long-
term monitoring, that the stored CO2 is stable. CCS operators have the obligation to contribute to
the Post-Closure Stewardship Fund and the provincial government will use this fund for ongoing
monitoring and any required maintenance and remediation.

Furthermore, the Oil and Gas Conservation Act was amended to specify elements of the Act which
apply to CCUS as definitions, the duty to abandon, entry and inspection authorities, and emergency
response measures48.

In 2011, the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation was passed and specified the requirements of
the lessee of an agreement that is necessary prior to drilling a well under the Mines and Mineral
Act. Furthermore, in 2012, the Responsible Energy Development Act was passed and it mandated
the creation of a single regulator for all oil, gas, oil sands, coal, and CCUS projects. Therefore, it
ordered a transition from the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) to the Alberta Energy
Regulator49.

In 2013, the Alberta Government concluded a two-year evaluation process of the Alberta’s CCUS
regulatory regime by a Regulatory Framework Assessment Steering Committee (RFA Steering

report contains recommendations for consideration by the Alberta Government.

Finally, it is important to note that, in 2012, the federal Canadian government announced strict
performance standards for new coal-fired units and units that have reached the end of their useful
life. These regulations are expected to result in a reduction of GHG emissions in Canada of about
214 metric megatons51.


2.1.4    CCUS in Australia: general regulatory features

The regulatory approach to CCUS in Australia has been a mix of modification to pre-existing
petroleum regulations and specific purpose legislation52. Governments have adopted a range of
policy and regulatory responses to address these potential resource management issues and conflicts
with the petroleum industries. There is a strong differentiation between the approaches adopted
offshore and onshore reflecting the different jurisdictions and challenges to be addressed53.

In 2006, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act (OPGGS Act) was passed. This
Act governs CO2 storage, provides for clear security of title for CO2 operators, and also clarifies
long term liability issues54. In 2009, the Australian government passed the Australian Government’s
Clean Energy Initiative that established the CCS Flagships program to support the construction of
large scale integrated CCS projects in Australia. The program promotes the wider dissemination of
CCS technologies by supporting a small number of demonstration projects that capture CO 2
emissions from industrial processes, provide transport infrastructure (generally pipelines) and safely
store CO2 underground in stable geological formations55.

The Government has put in place clear legislative provisions and approval mechanisms to ensure oil
and gas resources are not compromised by CO2 storage operations. CO2 storage and the petroleum
industries target similar geological structures and therefore conflict between the two is always
possible. The Responsible Commonwealth Minister (RCM), the decision maker under the OPGGS
Act, must be satisfied that CO2 injection will not have a “significant risk of a significant adverse
impact”56.

There is other Commonwealth legislation regarding CCUS projects: the Environment Protection
and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) is relevant for CCUS projects and the
Environmental Guidelines for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Geological Storage, 2009 provides
detailed implementing arrangements.

Commonwealth government has jurisdiction from three nautical miles offshore to the edge of
Australia’s continental shelf, while the states and territories have jurisdiction over CO2 storage
onshore and up to three nautical miles offshore57.

The Government of Victoria has been the first state to support CCS projects. An example is the
CarbonNet project in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, one of the four projects shortlisted by the CCS
Flagships program that integrated multi-user capture, transport and storage infrastructure project,
with sources of CO2 from electricity generation and industry in that area58.

In 2008, the Victorian Greenhouse Gas Geological Sequestration Act (GGGS Act) was passed,
reflecting many of the principles of the State’s Petroleum Act 1988, but also making clear that
existing petroleum (and other) interests - which could include other CO2 storage operators as well as
other subsurface users - should not be adversely affected59.

In 2012, Victoria’s Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2010 (OPGGS Act) came
into force and the associated Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulations 2011.
The offshore legislative framework has effect in Victoria’s state wate rs up to the jurisdictional
boundary with the Commonwealth of Australia (Commonwealth). The commencement of the
offshore legislative framework makes Victoria the first state in Australia with a comprehensive
legislative and regulatory framework that provides for CCUS (GHG injection and storage) activities
in both onshore and offshore areas60.

The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and the Victorian
Environmental Protection Authority (VEPA) are to jointly regulate onshore CCS activities in the
state, with DELWP serving as the primary regulator during exploration and injection, and VEPA to
assume this role following site closure61.

Although Australia developed policies in support of climate change mitigation and CCUS projects,
last year the proposed carbon tax and the emission trade scheme (Carbon Pricing Mechanism) were
repealed62. On August 11th, 2015, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Abbott announced a new
emission reduction goal for 2030 of 19-22% of GHG emission reductions63.

2.2     RELEVANT MODEL POLICIES: LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM RESEARCH

This report also considers a number of model policies and toolkits in more detail with a view to
extracting best practices and essential components of a regulatory framework for CCUS activities.
Ongoing research in support of the development of sound regulatory frameworks for CCUS can
provide useful conclusions and suggestions when preparing regulatory frameworks for CCUS.
A range of policy documents were selected for review as part of this study, including documents
from international organizations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), specialized
research centers, such as the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI), or academic contributions, such as
those published by the University College London (UCL) Legal Programme on CCS. The
documents are not only quite different in nature, but also in their scope. For example, the IEA
Model Regulatory Framework is one of the most comprehensive assessments of regulatory
requirements needed for the sound deployment of CCUS projects. It should be kept close at hand
during the development of a regulatory framework for CCUS projects to ensure the
comprehensiveness and coherence of a good regulatory framework for these activities. It is
therefore systematically included in our assessment of the key regulatory issues in this report. The
assessment is completed with some of the experiences in other countries. Other documents, such as
the UCL Legal Programme report provide a less comprehensive framework, but focus on very
specific regulatory aspects of CCUS, such as property rights or liability in a useful amount of detail.

The following documents have been selected for an in-depth assessment as part of this review.

2.2.1    International Energy Agency Carbon Capture and Storage Model Regulatory
         Framework

The IEA Carbon Capture and Storage Model Regulatory Framework was prepared by the
International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Carbon Capture and Storage Unit to deal with the increasing
need to address regulatory issues concerning CCUS, in parallel with supporting ongoing efforts to
demonstrate the technical, safety and environmental viability of industrial-scale CCUS projects.
Through a synthesis review of CCUS regulatory frameworks already in place in Europe, Australia,
the United States and elsewhere, e.g. South Africa, the Model aims to provide a practical tool to
assist countries at earlier stages in the regulatory preparation process in developing appropriate
frameworks. It proposes key principles for addressing the broad range of regulatory issues
associated with CCUS - e.g. classification, authorization, enforcement and oversight, property
rights, liability - provides comprehensive examples, as well as a complete Model Text (basic
legislative style wording) for a regulatory framework (Annex 1).

2.2.2    Global CCS Institute Carbon Capture and Storage Regulatory Test Toolkit for
         Scotland, 2011

This toolkit was prepared by Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage (SCCS) on behalf of the Scottish
Government and sponsored by the GCCSI. It is a guide for a regulatory test exercise (including a
workshop). The Scottish CCS test exercise concluded that environment agencies could permit a
good application within the existing regulatory framework which was generally considered fit-for-
purpose. The exercise noted that cooperation across government departments and regulators would
be essential to ensure effective management of CCS in the UK in a timely manner.

2.2.3    Global CCS Institute Carbon Capture and Storage Regulatory Test Toolkit for
         Romania, 2011

In the context of Romania’s Getica CCS Project (submitted for NER300), a CCS Toolkit was

                                                                                                    31
developed by the CCS Institute based on the test exercise for Scotland, to help the Romanian
Government test and improve the legislative framework governing the implementation of CCS
projects in Romania. A matrix identifying the permits, approvals and authorizations required for
implementing CCS projects was prepared with the purpose of assessing the regulatory framework
for the capture of CO2, its transport by pipeline and its storage in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.
Overall, the Toolkit stated that mostly there was a need for increased institutional capacity to
improve the permitting process and for authorities to better understand CCS technology. Other
regulatory aspects were raised in a workshop, such as the need to adopt an approach on EIAE
requirements for such activities.

2.2.4   Global CCS Institute Carbon Capture and Storage Regulatory Review for Trinidad
        and Tobago, 2012

A review of the regulatory framework in Trinidad and Tobago was carried out in 2012 focusing on
regulation and permit-granting on the ground. The Review includes a comprehensive Permitting
Matrix which identifies permitting requirements and approval timelines already provided for in
national legislation as regards all the components (design, construction, operation,
decommissioning, post-decommissioning). The Review considered how a CCUS project,
throughout the entire project chain, could fall under the existing legal and regulatory framework of
Trinidad and Tobago. The authors conclude that a CCUS project could be regulated with some
modifications of existing laws and regulations, as legislation regulating the oil and gas industry was
already in place and could accommodate a CCUS project, especially if the proposed project was to
capture CO2 from an industrial facility (such as an ammonia plant) and pipe the CO2 either offshore
or onshore to an existing oil or gas reservoir to be used for an Enhanced Oil Recovery-CCUS
project. The Environmental Management Act 2000, The Petroleum Act 1969 and The Pipelines Act
1933 were identified as key pieces of legislation that would impact on any CCUS law, whether it
would be incorporated into existing legislation, or if new legislation would be created. The Review
identified (during the drafting of the review but also during a stakeholder consultation workshop)
some important regulatory gaps, overlaps, policy issues and areas of improvement that the Trinidad
and Tobago Government needed to consider as part of a comprehensive and rigorous regulation of
CCUS, including, for instance, on liability.

2.2.5   Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC)’s Task Force on Carbon
        Capture and Geologic Storage

In 2002 the IOGCC undertook a two-phase, five-year effort leading a task force whose purpose was
an examination of the technical, policy and regulatory issues relating to the storage of CO2 in
subsurface geological media in IOGCC member states, provinces, and state and provincial oil and
gas agencies.

Based on the experience of (and aimed to provide a regulatory framework to) the United States and
Canada, a first report highlighted the key conclusion that states and provinces would be the most
logical and experienced regulators of the geologic storage of carbon dioxide, thanks to their
jurisdiction, experience and expertise in the regulation of oil and natural gas production and natural
gas storage. Hence, the purpose of Phase 2 was to provide a state or a province contemplating the
adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for the storage of CO2 with the resources needed to
draft a framework that meets the unique requirements of that particular state or province. The final
report included the development of a detailed Guidance Document containing a Model Statute for
Geologic Storage of CO2, Model Rules and Regulations governing the storage of CO2 (appendix 1
and 2 respectively), and an analysis of property rights’ issues related to underground space. The
Task Force recognized that the most logical and best equipped lead agency for implementing and

                                                                                                   32
administering regulations effectively would be the state oil and gas regulatory agency. However,
other states, especially those without an existing oil and gas regulatory agency, might designate
another entity, such as an environmental agency or public utility commission.

2.2.6   IEA CCS Legal and Regulatory Reviews. Edition 4

In order to generate appropriate policy frameworks to promote the deployment of CCUS in a safe
and environmentally responsible manner, in 2008 the IEA established the IEA international CCS
Regulatory Network as a forum for sharing knowledge amongst regulators and policy makers. The
CCS Regulatory Review documents and analyzes recent CCUS legal and regulatory developments
from around the world. Relevant results have been included in the detailed assessment tables below.

2.2.7   Carbon Capture Legal Programme (CCLP), 2009 – 2014

The CCLP was set up in June 2007 by University College London (UCL) with the aim of providing
a dedicated, up-to-date, open-access and independent resource for the analysis of legal aspects of
CCUS. It covers legal and policy developments in various jurisdictions around the world with a
view to promoting informed and coordinated discussion and analysis between all involved
stakeholders, e.g. government, industry and the wider community. The sources cover a very broad
spectrum of topics relevant to all phases of a CCS project: analysis of national and international
legislation and practice, presentation and analysis of case studies, policy reviews, as well as
presentation of more technical issues.
Under the present review, focus has been given to resources from 2010 onwards (with the exception

2.3      IN-DEPTH ASSESSMENT OF THE KEY REGULATORY FEATURES: BEST REGULATORY
         PRACTICES

In this section, an in-depth assessment of the key regulatory issues in some jurisdictions where CCS
projects have been implemented in recent years will be presented. The key issues can be grouped
into five main categories:
      General regulatory issues for CCUS: sections 2.3.1 to 2.3.8
      CO2 capture: 2.3.9 to 2.3.11
      CO2 transport: 2.3.12 to 2.3.14
      CO2 storage and utilization: 2.3.15 to 2.3.28
      Environmental and health and safety requirements applicable to all stages: 2.3.29 to 2.3.38


2.3.1      Classification of CO2 and its legal implications

The IEA Model Regulatory Framework notes that a first issue to be considered when designing
regulatory frameworks for CCUS is how CO2 is or will be classified under national or international
law. The classification of CO2 will have major implications on the way existing regulatory
frameworks might apply to CCUS activities64. For instance, the classification of CO2 as a pollutant
might result in industrial emissions legislation applying to the industrial installation where CO2
capture could be implemented and thus environmental protection requirements apply. The
classification of CO2 as a waste or a commodity, on the other hand, might have important legal
implications for storage or use operations. The IEA Model Regulatory Framework presents several
potential classification options, of which many are reflected in the existing regulatory frameworks
examined, including the classification of CO2 as hazardous, a waste, a pollutant or a commodity.
These are the most likely classifications of CO2 in the context of CCUS activities.

In the European Union (EU), CO2 is classified as a pollutant when emitted. Therefore, legislation
concerning industrial emissions, as well general environmental legislation (concerning e.g.
environmental impact assessment and liability for environmental damage), is applicable to CCS
activities in the EU. CO2 captured and transported for the purposes of geological storage has been
explicitly excluded from the scope of application of waste legislation (by virtue of an amendment to
Directive 2006/60/EC on waste and Regulation 1013/2006 on shipments of waste) with a view to
avoiding the application of the strict EU waste requirements to CCS activities. Finally, the CCS
Directive, as a legal instrument specifically designed to regulate the storage of CO 2, refers
specifically to CO2 without proceeding to a classification of the substance in this legislation.

In Canada, there is currently no single, definitive classification of CO2. Federal regulation
recognized that, although CO2 is not a toxic gas, it remains managed under Schedule 1 of CEPA
1999, which establishes a list of toxic substances, in order to enable the Government the use of a
variety of preventive or control actions with a view to protecting the environment. In the province
of Alberta, CO2 classification occurs as a result of four specific regulatory objectives, namely
environmental protection and climate change, natural resource extraction, health and safety and
transportation. This results, though not in an exhaustive manner, in a classification of CO 2 as the
following:

                                                                                                 34
•        an industrial product or commodity
•        a controlled product, hazardous substance or hazardous waste, and
•        a specified gas.
A Regulatory Working Group in charge of an Alberta CCS Regulatory Framework Assessment
(RFA) concluded that there is no need to change how CO2 is currently classified in Alberta. The
report clarified how CO2 is classified in the three main phases of a CCS project65. For worker safety,
Alberta has classified CO2 as a “harmful substance” by the Occupational Health and Safety
Regulation (OHSR); “controlled product” by the Controlled Product Regulations listed in Schedule
II to the Hazardous Product Act and “hazardous waste” by the Occupational Health and Safety
Code 200066. The transport stage of CCUS would generally be similar to the regulatory framework
concerned with public safety and environmental control that governs pipelines and shipping. The
Pipeline Act has no express classification for CO2 although it is likely to come under the definition
of “gas”. The existing classifications of CO2 in Alberta which fit the storage stage would be
“specified gas.” This is because any leakage would likely amount to the emission of CO2 into the
atmosphere. If the stored CO2 contained other impurities, it may moreover be classified as “toxic”.

Also in the United States (US), classification of CO2 depends on the stage in the CCUS project
cycle: transportation, capture or storage. It should also be noted that state governments have
legislative power over certain aspects of CCS activities and, e.g. Dakota67 and Oklahoma68
consider CO2 as a commodity. To the extent CO2 is transported via road or rail, the US Department
of Transportation (USDOT) regulations (related to transportation of hazardous materials) would
apply. Carbon dioxide is considered a Class 2.2 (non- flammable gas) hazardous material under the
USDOT regulations. Pursuant to these regulations, special handling requirements are provided for
transport of CO2 by rail and by road69. Dense-phase CO2 pipelines are classified as hazardous-liquid
pipelines under the USDOT’s Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)70. CO2 is not normally considered
a waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). However, CO2 that is
captured (CO2 streams) from emission sources like power plants and large industrial operations, and
injected deep underground in Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI wells for the sole
purpose of long-term isolation from the atmosphere, is considered by the USEPA to be a waste71.
The USEPA considers that the management of CO2 streams under the specified conditions does not
present a substantial risk to human health, or the environment72. In December 2013, USEPA
conditionally excluded CO2 captured from power plants and industrial sources and injected into
UIC Class VI wells from RCRA hazardous waste regulation. The USEPA has also determined that
CO2 injected into Class VI wells does not present a substantial risk to human health or the
environment and should be exempted from the regulation73. Finally, in other regulatory assessments
carried out as a preparation for legislation on CCUS, similar classifications in line with domestic

conditions and regulatory frameworks were identified. For example, the CCS Regulatory review of
the GCCSI identified the classifications as pollutant, hazardous substance, waste and water
pollutant as potential options in Trinidad and Tobago.

Overall, it can be concluded that in most jurisdictions, multiple classifications of CO2 are used for
the different stages in implementation of a CCUS project. Overall, the classification of CO2 as a
pollutant, emission or hazardous substance is considered important to ensure the application of
environmental protection legislation. In certain jurisdictions, the classification of CO2 as a
hazardous substance is complicated due to the non-hazardous properties of CO2. However, Canada,
for example, uses a flexible scheme for hazardous substances whereby substance-specific
requirements are set out in the legislation, thus enabling the inclusion of a wider range of substances
in the scope of the legislation. In several jurisdictions, the classification of CO2 as a waste is
considered a useful tool to establish a legal framework for the injection of CO2 as part of CCUS
projects. On the other hand, however, the EU has designed a specific legal framework for storage
activities enabling the injection of CO2 directly and excluding CCS activities from the EU waste
legislation. This was done to avoid the application of burdensome waste requirements to CCS
activities, such as the strict requirements on shipments of waste.

2.3.2     Property rights

Operators of CCUS projects are required to have certain property rights or derived rights from such
property rights in order to enable the implementation of the specific activities under the project. In a
2012 publication of the UCL CCS Legal Program on property rights in relation to CCS 74, property
is defined as relating to ownership and property rights can be conceived as ´a bundle or rights
comprising not only the right to own, but also the right to use and the right to enjoy´. The report
notes that the term ‘real property’ refers to property of the land (e.g. soil) and anything growing o n
it, attached to it or built on it (fixed assets), as well as legal rights concerning the land (e.g. right of
way or right to extract minerals)75. Private property can refer to tangible assets over which the
owner has exclusive and absolute rights, such as the wellhead equipment at a CO2 injection
operation76. Finally, there is public property, which is not restricted to any one individual’s use or
possession and is owned by a public body77.

There are a number of property rights which should therefore be considered prior to the
implementation of a CCUS project. In the specific context of CCS activities, the EIA regulatory
model identifies those property rights as78:
- Ownership of the captured and stored CO2. The ownership of stored CO2 is relevant to
   establish liability requirements for potential leakages of CO2. This is particularly important in
   relation to the transfer of long-term responsibility for the CO2 stored in geological formation,
   including when the stewardship is transferred to the competent authorities. Ownership of the
   capture of CO2 should therefore reside with the operator during the operational phase of the
   project, based on a chain of custody across the capture, transportation, injection and storage

     components of a project79. This can be achieved through authorization processes that allocate
     responsibility for CO2 during the several stages of a CCUS project, such as, for example, for
     capture through the environment permit for industrial activities (see below)80.
-    Property rights over surface infrastructure and access to infrastructure. Determining
     property interests at a storage site is essential to acquiring the necessary surface and subsurface
     rights for injecting and storing CO2 in the target geological formation81.
-    Property rights regarding sub-surface pore space/storage of injected CO2 (usually state
     owned), including rights of adjacent users in the event of leakage or unintended migration and
     potential impact on other minerals therein. Pore space (the geological formation where CO 2 is
     stored) ownership varies between jurisdictions and has to be clearly articulated to allow for
     certainty for permitting CO2 storage operations. There has to be a process for allocating storage
     of access to the subsurface rights which will also consider how to prioritize CO2 storage rights
     versus oil /gas82.
-    Intellectual property rights as regards technology and know-how (capture, transportation,
     storage, sub-surface appraisal, sub-surface data, reservoir modelling and monitoring techniques
     and approaches).

Property rights and the legal procedures associated with such rights, highly depend on general legal
traditions in the country and domestic circumstances. Moreover, it is an area of law which is
particularly influenced by the distinctions between civil law and common law systems, as well as
countries with a history of nationally centralized land ownership or countries developed on the basis
of feudal systems. Also land rights of indigenous groups merit particular consideration in some
countries.
Given the potential for different property regimes to apply to geologic storage formations,
governments considering CCUS may wish to adopt dedicated CCUS legislation addressing rights
over pore space to ensure legal certainty regarding ownership83.

EU level legislation does not regulate property rights. Property rights, concerning both land
property as well as property of capture, transport and storage installations, are regulated at the
Member State (national) level and are marked by significant differences across the EU Member
States, due to historical reasons. In a majority of countries in the EU, however, mineral rights are
publically owned. In the US, property rights vary depending on the state legislation. Canada and
Australia have adopted clarifying legislation with to the aim of clearly regulating the issue of
property rights for CCS projects. Canada amended the Mines and Minerals Act and the Gas
Conservation Act to this end. Similarly to Mexico, in Saskatchewan, although the pore space is
public (belongs to the Crown), it is not clear if this right would extend to CO2 disposal projects or if
the pore space ownership would be vested in the surface owner or in the Crown. In relation to
property aspects of the capture side, the Saskatchewan public energy plants are subject to the same
legal requirements as private power plants.

Surface property rights

Surface property rights in Canada can be distinguished between those relating to private and public
land. The use of private land requires an agreement between a lessee and the landowner. On public
lands, a mineral surface lease must be obtained from Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP).
In the US, surface property rights vary depending on state regulation and are not always clearly
regulated. In case of uncertainty, the state courts will have the power to take a final decision
regarding property rights. Land for pipeline construction in the US is, for instance, often leased
from private landowners, or acquired through eminent domain where landowners and pipeline
sponsors are unable to reach agreement. Under existing precedent in many states, the surface estate
owner is generally viewed as not only the owner of the surface land, but also the land and strata
overlying the severed mineral estate (Marquette Cement Min. Co. v. Oglesby Coal Co., 253 F. 107
(1918)).

Subsurface property and pore space rights

The Canadian Mines and Minerals Act declares that all pore space, except that under federally
owned lands, is owned by the province. The Act enables the Minister of Energy to enter into
agreements to grant pore space rights and allows the provincial government to accept long-term
liability for properly sequestered CO284. Pore space is defined by the Carbon Sequestration Tenure
Regulation as the ´pores contained in, occupied by or formerly occupied by minerals or water below
the surface of land´. This Regulation also stipulates that pore space tenure can only be granted at
depths greater than 1000 meters. In the US, on the contrary, the majority view provides that the
subsurface pore space, where CO2 would likely be stored, belongs to the surface owner (USDOE,
2009). The State of Wyoming passed legislation explicitly establishing the majority view as a rule
of law in the state (H.B. 89 2008). Other states were said to be considering similar legislation as
well. Thus, in many cases legal access to deep geological formations in the US would require either
ownership of the surface estate overlying the targeted formation, or lease rights from such an owner
85
   . In the absence of express language in the mineral grant, pore space ownership should remain
with the surface owner despite severance. However, the wording of the operative agreements must
be evaluated to determine whether or not a broader conveyance occurred. This conclusion is
supported by a number of cases in other jurisdictions addressing ownership of storage space for
natural gas. Gas storage cases in Texas, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Michigan have all
stated that the surface owner, and not a mineral rights holder, retains ownership of pore space86. In
Australia, ownership of most subsurface resources (including minerals/petroleum and use of pore
space) is vested in the crown (on behalf of the people)87. Also in the state of Victoria, the Crown
owns all underground geological storage formations below the surface of any lands, to the extent
that the formation is deeper than 15-24 meters below the surface of the land. The Crown is not
liable to pay any compensation in respect of a loss caused by the operation of this section88. Under
the Victorian legislation, the Crown retains Crown land rights in respect of any residual
underground geological formation below the surface of that land unless otherwise stated in the
document by which the grant, lease, license or other tenure is conferred89. In Trinidad and Tobago,

even if the land is privately held, the State has ownership over the subsurface and pore space in
most instances. Significant areas where in the past land rights, including sub surface rights, were
granted to private individuals can be bequeathed, but not sold; if the land itself is sold, then the
subsurface rights will revert back to the State90. In saline formations, ownership of pore space may
follow ownership of water resources more generally91.

The regulation of property rights thus greatly varies from one jurisdiction to another, both for
surface rights and subsurface rights. In the US, land rights are mostly privately owned and access to
such rights will therefore have to be negotiated with individual land owners. In other countries, such
as Canada, surface rights are mixed in nature and can either be privately or publically owned. The
property rights of subsurface pore space are often not clearly regulated. In most countries, the pore
space in which the CO2 is injected will be publically owned. This is, however, not the case in the
US.

Finally, native titles or land rights shall be considered when considering the issue of property rights
for CCUS projects. In Australia, for example, enjoyment of property rights will often be subject to
the provisions of Federal and State native title legislation. Native title refers to rights held by
indigenous Australians over their traditional lands and waters. Australian law provides protections
to native title holders and claimants where a government proposes to take certain actions (for
example, the grant of a license or approval) which may affect native title. These protections are
provided by the Australian Government’s Native Title Act 1993 (NTA) and similar State and
Territory legislation and typically require that certain procedural steps, such as notification and
consultation, be observed prior to the action being done. The Federal legislation provides for the
negotiation of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, voluntary agreements between native title groups
and other entities for the use of land subject to native title. In the US, the EPAct05 creates a
mechanism by which Indian tribes may issue rights-of-way for pipelines (not to exceed thirty years)
on tribal lands without specific approval by the Secretary of the Interior92.

2.3.3     Competition with users and preferential rights issues

When an operator has undertaken an extensive survey under a CO2 storage site exploration
authorization, the IEA recommends that preferential rights should be given to that operator to apply
for authorization to develop the site and to store CO2, subject to time limits. The IEA also
recommends considering ways for clarifying interaction with the CO2 injected formations with
regard to existing authorizations relating to other uses of the sub-surface. It also calls for providing
for conflict resolution in the event that disputes arise in authorizing sub-surface activities.

Under the EU regulatory framework, the holder of an exploration permit must have the sole right
to explore the potential of a CO2 storage complex and no conflicting uses of the complex are
permitted during the period of validity of the exploration permit. Priority for the granting of a
storage permit for a site must be given to the holder of the exploration permit for that site under a
number of conditions. There must only be one operator on the site and no conflicting uses are
permitted on the site during the validity of the storage permit. In Australia the Offshore Petroleum
and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGS Act) provides for holders of existing greenhouse
gas assessment permits or holding leases to apply for greenhouse injection licenses in respect of
identified greenhouse gas formations within the relevant title areas. These parties therefore
effectively have preference in applying for greenhouse gas injection licenses within their respective

title areas. Competition with other uses is regulated through procedures in the OPGGS Act whereby
it is ensured that one activity is compatible with other existing uses in the same site. In particular,
the Responsible Commonwealth Minister (RCM) - the decision-maker under this Act - must be
satisfied that CO2 injection will not have a “significant risk of a significant adverse impact” o n pre-
existing petroleum titles or operations (the SROSAI test)93. The Offshore Petroleum and
Greenhouse Gas Storage Act also provides other methods which may resolve resource conflict
issues. Where petroleum and GHG projects are proposed in the same area, the Act provides for
commercial agreements between petroleum and GHG proponents. It is only in the absence of any
such commercial agreements, that the RCM will have to decide whether an activity under one title
would pose a significant risk of a significant adverse impact on operations that could be carried on
under the other title94. Section 494 of the OPGGS Act establishes a principle of co-existence of
greenhouse gas titles and petroleum titles. Where such titles may or do overlap, the Act requires
analysis of the risk and potential impacts of greenhouse gas operations on petroleum operations, as
a basis for determining whether the greenhouse gas operations should be allowed to proceed95.

Canada and the US do not explicitly provide for such preferential development rights. In Canada
the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation does not provide the holder of permit or the lessee
with the exclusive right to evaluate, test or inject captured CO2 within the area of the permit or
lease. Neither does a permit holder obtain a preferential right to acquire a lease out of the area in
which it holds a permit96. However, the Oil and Gas Conservation Act requires a project proponent
to demonstrate that a CO2 sequestration project will not interfere with the recovery, conservation, or
storage of oil or gas97. Also, the Mines and Minerals Act establishes that if an agreement purports
to grant rights in respect of a mineral and those rights are included in any disposition issued
previously, the agreement is void insofar as it interferes with the previous disposition. In the US, the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) does not currently have a statutory or regulatory mechanism
that directly addresses the assurances sought by current applicants for a non-competitive preference
right to develop future CCUS projects after initial site characterization studies98. It seems, however,
that this is regulated indirectly through the issue of property rights whereby a prior right granted
would have preference over subsequent rights.

Neither of the above systems provides for conflict resolution procedures as recommended by the
IEA nor specific clarifications concerning the interaction with the CO2 injected formations with
regard to existing authorizations relating to other uses of the sub-surface. However, it is expected
this would be covered by general court proceedings based on the rights associated with the property
rights granted for the use of a site.

The EU is a mixed jurisdiction with a predominance of civil law systems and explicitly codifies the
regulatory framework on preferential rights’ requirements. Most of the countries analyzed that do
not regulate preferential development rights are common law systems where such rights are not
explicitly codified. In such countries, conflicting uses are, however, regulated through property law
as the surface and pore space rights are the property of the owner of the surface.

2.3.4         Composition of the CO2 stream

Regulating the composition of the CO2 stream is important as some streams of captured CO2 may
contain impurities which could have certain environmental or health impacts. The IEA CCS Model
Regulatory Framework calls for a case-by case assessment of the risks that certain impurities pose,
taking into account, for example, the concentration and levels of mass flow of impurities and
potential impacts of impurities, including on CO2 infrastructure, human health and the environment.

     Box 2. Recommended elements to consider in regulating the composition of CO 2 stream (as set out in
     the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework)

               Monitoring and reporting requirements on operators regarding the composition of CO 2
                streams;
               Imposing CO2 acceptance criteria for operators within permit ;authorizations
               Recognizing obligations under international treaties, including in relation to the
                authorized composition of CO2 streams for storage;
               Amending existing laws in order to allow CCUS activities to take place ( e.g.
                groundwater protection laws).


In the EU, the CCS Directive sets out that a CO2 stream must consist overwhelmingly of carbon
dioxide. A CO2 stream may contain incidental associated substances from the source, capture or
injection process and trace substances added to assist in monitoring and verifying CO2 migration.
Concentrations of all incidental and added substances must be below levels that would: (a)
adversely affect the integrity of the storage site or the relevant transport infrastructure; (b) pose a
significant risk to the environment or human health; or (c) breach the requirements of applicable
Community legislation. The operator is required to keep a register of the quantities and properties
of CO2 streams delivered and injected, including the composition of these streams. Some Member
States have introduced stricter legal requirements and have specified in their legislation the
percentage of carbon dioxide that the CO2 stream should consist of (e.g. in Latvia the CO2 stream
must comprise at least 96% volume of CO2). The European Commission has also adopted
guidelines to help Member States respect the above criteria99. The US regulatory framework defines
the CO2 stream in much broader terms as the carbon dioxide that has been captured from an
emission source, plus incidental associated substances derived from the source materials and the
capture process, and any substances added to the stream to enable or improve the injection
process100. Similarly in Canada there are no industry-wide standards or limits on the level of
impurities in CO2 streams in CCS projects101. The existing regulatory framework considers
impurities only for acid gas projects. In this case, they are evaluated on a case-by-case basis102. In
Australia, the term ‘CCS stream’ is defined as ‘a gas or liquid/fluid, consisting predominately of
carbon dioxide… [which] may contain other substances depending on both the source from which
the carbon dioxide is being drawn as well as the capture, separation, injection and monitoring
processes used’. The OPGGS Act requires CO2 streams for injection to be either pure, or consist
“overwhelmingly” of, CO2103. CO2 streams may, however, also contain incidental related
substances104 and detection agents, provided that, where the CO2 stream contains a prescribed

Approaches to the regulation of the composition of the CO2 stream differ in the various
jurisdictions. The EU regulatory framework is the most prescriptive regarding the composition of
the CO2 stream and explicitly provides elements to consider in determining the concentrations of all
incidental and added substances. Some Member States such as Latvia, using the margin of
discretion of the EU framework, have opted for setting very strict criteria with regard to the CO 2
composition. The US and Canada, on the other hand, have followed a very broad approach.

2.3.5    Engaging the public in decision making

The IEA highlights that engaging public stakeholders in the regulatory process for CCUS projects
can be vital in ensuring that a project can proceed. The public should also have information on
associated risks (and the measures taken to manage these) and benefits. The IEA recommends that
regulatory approaches should include methods for public engagement and promote public
participation in the decision-making process, which draw on existing approaches adopted such as
the EIA, including among other measures transparent reporting of the authorization process,
providing opportunities for public input at each stage of the process, community meetings and
workshops for planned projects and internet portals containing technical information. The IEA also
calls for effective dispute resolution mechanisms to ensure that conflicts of interest can be resolved.

Under EU law the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive provides that in the course of the
permitting procedure, the public concerned must be given early and effective opportunities to
participate in the decision making procedures when an environmental impact assessment is required
for a given project. The general public has the right to be informed (by virtue of public notices or by
other appropriate means, such as electronic media) within a reasonable time-frame about certain
issues. The EIA Directive also provides for judicial review for the public concerned with sufficient
interest105 to challenge the substantive or procedural legality of the decision (permit), act or
omission. In the US, administrative procedure codes for most US states and for the Federal
government contain mechanisms by which stakeholders can mount a legal challenge to State action
with respect to the licensing or permitting of major projects. A person “suffering legal wrong
because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning
of a relevant statute” is entitled to judicial review. The siting of large scale transportation projects
are also likely to be subject to public consultation. CCS operators would also need to obtain
approval from tribal leaders in addition to the Environmental Protection Agency prior to injecting
CO2 on tribal lands. In Canada, the requirements applied fall within the oil and gas regulatory
framework which provides for informing local stakeholders and addressing concerns. This includes
participant involvement requirements and expectations that must be considered for an application
for energy development and throughout the life of that development. Project operators must also
confirm that stakeholders do not have objections to the project. Where a confirmation of non-
objection is not obtained, the project may proceed to a hearing. Consultation of First Nations is also
required if it is deemed that a project may adversely impact the Rights and Traditional Uses. In
Australia, CCUS legislation provides extensive stakeholder engagement mechanisms in respect of
pipeline license applications. Details of the application must be published, and a pipeline license
applicant must provide notice of its application to the owners and occupiers of lands to which the
application relates. The GGGS Act also provides for community consultation on the environmental
impacts of the respective plans. Where actions may affect indigenous people, the Australian
105
   What constitutes a sufficient interest and impairment of a right is to be determined by the Member States, consistently
with the objective of giving the public concerned wide access to justice. In this context, non-governmental organizations
promoting environmental protection and meeting any requirements under national law are deemed to have a sufficient
interest or, alternatively, are deemed to have rights capable of being impaired.

                                                                                                                       42
Government’s Native Title Act requires that certain procedural steps, such as notification and
consultation, be observed prior to any action being taken. The law also provides for voluntary
agreements between indigenous people and other entities for the use of indigenous land.

Various approaches to consultation requirements exist across the jurisdictions analyzed. Australia
provides for consultation requirements specifically in its CCUS legislation, while in the EU this
falls within the EIA framework. In the US, public consultation requirements within administrative
procedure codes apply. While in Canada, requirements under the oil and gas framework apply in the
context of CCS. The US, Canadian and Australian regulatory frameworks also provide for
consultation requirements specific to indigenous persons where actions may affect them.

2.3.6   Scope of framework and prohibitions

The scope of a regulatory framework for CCUS depends largely on the type of CCUS projects and
regulatory wishes to allow in its territory and compatibility with other legislation. To avoid
confusion, it is important to clearly establish the scope of the applicable regulations, for each of the
separate activities in the CCUS chain.

The EU CCS Directive applies to geological storage of CO2 in the territory of the Member States,
their exclusive economic zones and on their continental shelves. The capture of CO2 is explicitly
covered by the EU Directive on industrial emissions. Finally, the EU allows Member States to ban
CCS activities from their territory. The CCS Directive clearly states it does not apply to the
geological storage of CO2 with a total intended storage below 100 kilotons, undertaken for research,
development or testing of new products and processes. The storage of CO2 in the water column is
not to be permitted in the EU. A water column is defined as “the vertically continuous mass of
water from the surface to the bottom sediments of a water body.” This is consistent with
requirements under the London Protocol and OSPAR Convention that injection of CO2 in offshore
areas must be into a sub-soil geological formation. The Alberta Carbon Capture and Storage
Statutes Amendment Act, 2010 amended a number of pieces of legislation explicitly mandating that
CCUS projects will not interfere with, or negatively impact, hydrocarbon projects in the province106.
The Alberta Water Act provides a framework for protection of non-saline groundwater and the
Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act prohibits the release of a substance in an amount
that may cause a significant adverse effect. Groundwater monitoring above the base of groundwater
protection (BGWP) is important to establish baseline data for freshwater aquifers. It also protects
the quality of the drinking water and provides assurance to the public. The US identifies the scope
of the legal framework by establishing limitations on the basis of competing uses or interests, such
as the protection of natural areas. Moreover, while not subject to the UIC Program, injection wells
up to three miles offshore could become subject to regulation under the Marine Protection,
Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). The USEPA recently submitted to Congress proposed
changes to MPRSA to implement the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Protocol). Among the proposed
changes is a provision to allow for and regulate CO2 sequestration in sub-seabed geological
formations under the MPRSA107.

2.3.7   Definition of ´CCS ready´ (CCSR)

CCS Ready (CCSR) relates to carbon-emissions-intensive plants being encouraged or required to
prepare for CCS during their design and planning phases so they are ready to retrofit CCS at a later

date. The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework acknowledges that a globally accepted definition
for CCSR will be difficult to achieve as the concept is likely to differ between jurisdictions subject
to region and site-specific issues and will need to be flexible enough to take into account external
factors such as rapidly changing technology. Neither the EU, the US, Canada nor Australia
explicitly define CCSR as such in their legal framework. The EU, Canada and the US nonetheless
provide for some elements relating to CCSR policy in their regulatory frameworks.

The EU introduces a CCSR requirement under which operators of all combustion plants with a
rated electrical output of 300 megawatts or more for which the original construction license or
original operating license is granted after the entry into force of the CCS Directive, must assess
whether certain conditions are met, including whether suitable storage sites are available and
whether both transporting and retrofitting for CO2 capture are technically and economically
feasible. In Canada the Guidance on Air Emissions and Monitoring Requirements during
Combustion of Non-Gaseous Fuels gives an interim definition of CO2 capture adapted from the
International Energy Agency (2007) and ICF International (2010) for the Emission Guidelines for
the Use of Non-gaseous Fossil Fuels. In the US the Best Available Control Technology (BACT)
mechanism under the Clean Air Act could potentially act as a de-facto CCS ready policy. It is a
mechanism for limiting emissions based on a case-by-case decision that takes into account technical
feasibility, cost, and other energy, environmental, and economic impacts. Also in the US, there is no
definition of CCS ready108.

2.3.8    Incentives for CCUS as part of climate mitigation strategies

As deploying the technology for CCUS is likely to present additional costs to businesses, incentives
are needed for operators to engage in CCUS deployment. The lack of incentives and long-term
perspective is considered the most important obstacle to the deployment of CCUS projects. The
IEA suggests that it is likely that incentives will be included in parallel frameworks that address
CO2 mitigation in general and suggests avoiding double regulation when developing parallel
regulatory and incentive schemes for CCUS. The IEA recommends the following types of incentive
frameworks that might be considered to promote CCUS deployment at large CO2 emitting point
source installations:

Box 3. Types of incentive frameworks (as set out in the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework)

     Carbon taxes imposed for each metric ton of CO2 that is emitted into the atmosphere: when
      CCUS prevents emission, tax is no longer imposed;
     Cap-and-trade based emission trading: emitters are given an allowance of emission rights
      and/or are required to purchase emissions rights from a pool and are subsequently required to
      surrender emission rights equal to the amount of CO 2 emitted over a given period. If CO2
      captured and securely stored is considered as “not-emitted,” CCS projects are absolved of the
      requirement to surrender emission rights for captured and stored CO 2;
     Project-based mechanisms: when projects reduce emissions below an agreed baseline, the
      resultant reductions generate emission reduction credits that can be traded in a carbon market;
     Feed-in tariffs and product-based incentives: an additional premium can be paid to producers if
      the product sold offers a lower emissions inventory compared to other similar products.
     Emissions performance standards: operators are required to reduce emissions – or a portfolio of
      emissions – below an agreed level per unit output;
     Technology mandates: direct requirements imposed on operators to undertake CCUS.

In the EU, emissions of CO2 captured, transported and stored for CCUS are covered by the EU’s
emissions’ trading scheme. This means that an obligation to surrender emission allowances does not
arise in respect of emissions of CO2 verified as captured and transported for permanent storage. In
Canada, the use of offset credits is one of four compliance options available to regulated
facilities109 to reduce emissions intensity. In the US, a range of measures were foreseen as
incentives for CCUS in the US in the 2009 ACES Act, also referred to the Waxman-Markey Bill.
The Act considered financial support for the first commercial-scale CCUS demonstration projects to
innovative technologies, loan guarantees, awards bonus GHG cap-and-trade allowances to subsidize
the cost of deploying CCUS, etc. However, as this bill was rejected by the Senate, the specific
incentives for CCUS have not been established. The EPACT05, however, authorized clean coal
investment tax credits that were authorized alongside new research spending and other financial
incentives, such as loan guarantees110. Additional tax incentives for clean coal were provided by the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA)111. On August 3th, 2015, president Obama
and USEPA announced the Clean Power Plan for reducing carbon pollution from power plants112.
The Clean Power Plan included a standard for CO2 emissions from new fossil fueled electric plants.
New coal-fired power plants will likely need to capture some portion of potential emissions to meet
final federal standards for emissions113. In Australia, incentives for CCS include funding through
the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund (CCSF) which has a value of AU $21.5 million and is
intended to support the deployment of CCUS demonstration projects in Asia and a safeguard
mechanism to deter businesses from increasing emissions (which will start as of July 2016). Finally,
a Safeguard Mechanism has been developed in Australia requiring a “responsible emitter” of a
designated large facility to prevent the net emissions from their facility from exceeding the baseline
emission levels during a monitoring period (a financial year). The safeguard mechanism will
commence on 1 July 2016, to provide time for further consultation with business on key policy
elements such as the treatment of new investments and flexible compliance arrangements114.

While in the US and Australia incentives to reduce CO2 emissions mainly involve financial support
and subsidies, incentives in the EU are covered by the ETS scheme. Similarly to the EU, in Canada
one of the four compliance options involves the use of offset credits. The new emission
performance standards for the power sector in the US, when adopted in 2015, are expected to
provide an important incentive for the introduction of low-carbon technologies and CO2 capture.
The same applies for the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia.

2.3.9    Authorization for CO2 capture

Various methods of capture may be employed as part of CCUS activities, all of which require the
installation of new equipment and additional technical processes to be undertaken at the designated
capture site. The IEA Model Regulatory Framework recommends that new permissions will be
needed to build and operate capture plants. Amendments to the laws that govern the operation of

109
    The other ways are: meeting its efficiency targets, paying the $15 per metric ton levy to the Climate Change and
Emissions Management Fund, and applying emissions performance credits (EPCs) (generated by a regulated facility that
beats its own target).

these installations may also be necessary and it is likely that in most cases amendments to existing
regulatory regimes could adequately address the capture element of the CCUS process. The IEA
provides examples of areas to consider when seeking to regulate CO2 capture, including planning
legislation with regard to treating a new plant with CO2 capture, laws associated with opportunities
for public engagement and consultation, as well as occupational health and safety in industrial
plants.

In the EU the authorization process for CO2 capture is mainly regulated by the provisions of the
industrial emissions and environmental impact assessment rules (IED and EIA). The IED rules set
out that installation or combustion plants, waste incineration plants or waste co-incineration plants
can only be operated with a permit and sets out permit requirements. Permit conditions for CO2
capture must be established by the competent authority, after prior consultations with the operator,
on the basis of best available techniques. The permit must include all necessary measures including,
inter alia, emissions’ limit values and suitable emission monitoring requirements. Member States
are free to establish and shape their (administrative) permitting procedures, including the
determination of competent authorities and division of their competences. Canadian legislation
considers CO2 as a toxic gas, harmful substance, controlled product and hazardous waste. Therefore
at the capture stage, CCS could be regulated through the mechanisms put in place by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA). Accidental release would likely be
governed by the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) relating to the release of
substances, and its regulations. In the US a national regulatory system explicitly applicable to CO2
capture has not yet been established. Where Federal agencies are significantly involved with a
CCUS project, the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) could apply,
requiring agencies to prepare Environmental Impact Statements. Retrofitting an existing power
plant with CCUS technology could also trigger New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the
Clean Air Act (CAA). NSR is a preconstruction permitting program that governs new sources and
major modifications to existing sources. Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), an applicant for a
Federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in a discharge to navigable waters
must provide the Federal agency with a certification asserting compliance with water quality
standards. Moreover, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System establishes permit
requirements for certain discharges from industrial sources. In Australia, CO2 capture is governed
by State planning and environment laws, which require that development of land be consistent with
local, regional and/or state-level environmental planning instruments (EPIs). CO2 capture
obligations could also be included in planning consents. A VEPA license is required for scheduled
premises. Licenses contain standard conditions that aim to control the operation of the premises so
that there is no adverse effect on the environment, including issues such as waste acceptance and
treatment, air and water discharges, and noise and odor,

All jurisdictions analyzed, apply industrial emissions’ legislation to the authorization of CO2
capture. In the EU, US and Australia, the legislation requires environmental permits, and this would
apply to capture. In Canada, authorization to capture would be regulated under Occupational Safety
and Health and industrial emission standards. In line with the recommendations from the IEA
Model and the clarifying amendments introduced in the EU CCS Directive, it is considered
appropriate to explicitly include CO2 capture in the existing regulatory frameworks with a view to
providing a clear regulatory framework for CO2 capture and any necessary additional requirements,
for instance in relation to monitoring.

2.3.10 Monitoring, reporting and verification requirements for CO2 capture

According to the IEA there is a close link between CO2 storage regulation and incentive schemes
for CCS and it is therefore crucial for the incentive scheme operator to gain assurance over the

                                                                                                  46
efficacy of a particular project to reduce CO2 emissions over the long term. Monitoring and
reporting activities for CCUS projects must therefore be carried out, including to provide sufficient
information to calculate the effectiveness of the project in terms of metric tons of CO2 stored and
metric tons of CO2 avoided. These calculations should provide the basis for ex-post awards of or
adjustments to credits or payments linked to emissions’ reductions achieved by a project.

In the EU, a permit for an installation (including CO2 capture installations) must include emission
monitoring requirements which should specify measurement methodology, frequency and
evaluation procedure. Results of this monitoring must be submitted to the competent authority
regularly, at least annually. The specific monitoring requirements for GHG installations in the EU
will apply. The CSS Directive also requires the operator to design a monitoring plan to be updated
every five years and submitted for approval to the competent authority. Reporting of pollutant
emissions in Canada is regulated in individual operating approvals and by the province’s Air
Monitoring Directive. Industry is required to submit monitoring reports to the Ministry of
Environment and Parks (AEP). Reporting requirements are specified in approvals and vary
depending on the substance, size and nature of the facility. The reports summarize ambient and
source monitoring data and provide information on the quality assurance and quality control
measures performed to ensure accurate data. In the US, the general monitoring requirements for
industrial emissions regulated by the Clean Air Act would apply to CO2. Operating permits granted
to major source of air pollutant emissions document how air pollution sources will monitor, either
periodically or continuously, their compliance with emission limits and all other applicable
requirements on an on-going basis. The monitoring involves all monitoring and analysis procedures
or test methods required under applicable monitoring and testing requirements, including
Compliance Assurance Monitoring. In Australia, a monitoring program must be developed by each
license holder based on a risk-based approach to determine the level of monitoring required. These
monitoring plans are auditable documents that a license holder must retain on the license premises
for seven years. License holders must lodge an annual performance statement (APS) with the
Victorian Environmental Protection Authority (VEPA), indicating whether it has complied or not
with each license condition. APS are public documents and severe penalties are provided in the Act
for providing a false or misleading APS.

All jurisdictions analyzed provide monitoring, reporting and verification requirements applicable to
CCUS. In the EU and US, monitoring requirements are included in industrial emission permits. In
Australia and the EU, a monitoring program is developed by the permit holder. In Canada, reporting
is regulated through individual operating approvals and monitoring reports sent to the environment
Ministry.

2.3.11 Inspection of industrial installations

No specific requirements with regard to the inspection of industrial installations in relation to CO2
capture were identified in the IEA Model Regulatory Framework. Nevertheless, CO2 capture can be
subject to inspections by competent authorities as part of general inspection requirements for
industrial installations in relation to the atmospheric emissions.

In the EU, the rules on industrial emissions set up a system of environmental inspections of IED
installations (including CO2 capture installations) to ensure examination of the full range of
environmental effects from the installation concerned. Operators must afford the competent
authorities all necessary assistance to enable those authorities to carry out any site visits, to take
samples and to gather any information necessary. Inspections must be routine and non-routine to
investigate serious environmental complaints, serious environmental accidents, incidents and
occurrences of non-compliance as soon as possible. In Canada, the Ministry of Environment and

                                                                                                   47
Parks (ESRD) has a Compliance Inspection Program which helps ensure that facilities meet the
requirements of their approvals or registrations. The program empowers department inspectors to
review and inspect all aspects of any facility’s approval or registration, in one visit. The review and
inspection can include taking samples of soil, groundwater and effluent and of air emissions at their
source. Significant non-compliance can result in enforcement action. In the US, monitoring
requirements are provided under the Clean Air Act (CAA) legislation. The Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) has developed a strategy to provide guidance with respect to
administering and implementing an Agency program for CAA compliance monitoring. Monitoring
is also provided under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Water Quality Act, which
give the USEPA the authority to regulate the discharge of pollutants to waters of the US. The
Permit Program provides for monitoring information through reporting and compliance inspections.
In Australia, authorized officers check compliance against each site’s license and gather specific
data to support the development of VEPA’s Licensed Operator Risk Assessment (LORA) model.
In addition to planned license compliance inspections, VEPA also inspects licensed sites as part of
auditing a licensee’s annual performance statement; responding to pollution and emergency reports
and incidents and undertaking local, regional, or sector-based strategic compliance initiatives.

All jurisdictions analyzed provide for such inspection requirements in their regulatory framework.
In the EU, US, and Australia this is covered by the rules on industrial emissions. In Canada, this is
carried out as part of the Ministry’s inspection program.

2.3.12 Authorization of transportation infrastructure (pipeline regulations, etc.)

Captured CO2 can be transported by various means including pipeline, ship, road, tanker or railway
car. The IEA recommends considering how existing regulations apply to analogous activities such
as natural gas transportation, as it is likely that many of the regulatory considerations will already
be covered by existing laws relating to such activities and/or could be conferred onto CO 2 pipeline
development and operation through amendments. The main areas for consideration include existing
laws relating to occupational health and safety; existing laws relating to civil protection, industrial
pollution and corporate liability; any development rights allowed under existing gas transportation
regulations; existing planning directives and environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures
relating to pipeline projects; emissions accounting requirements; and laws relating to the reuse of
pipeline infrastructures or decommissioning (e.g. petroleum laws). Any proposed modifications to
laws should take into account the potential unintended consequences that could arise for existing
activities as a result of modifying existing legislation. Current regulations and industry operations
should also be analyzed to assess whether they will already apply or whether they need to be
modified. It might also be necessary to develop secondary guidelines under existing legislation to
cover specific technical matters relating to CO2 transportation. Such guidelines should take into
account the properties of the CO2 to be transported, such as the properties of the CO2 stream and
pressure and release characteristics in the event of containment failure.

In the EU, the authorization of transportation infrastructure is not regulated under the CCS
legislation. The environmental impact assessment rules are applicable to the permitting process for
CO2 pipelines (pipelines with a diameter of more than 800mm and length of more than 40 km for
transportation of CO2 must undergo an environmental impact assessment before a permit for these
activities is granted by the competent authority). Aside from EIA rules, the CO2 transportation
infrastructure authorization process must be regulated by Member States. In some Member States,
gas pipeline permits are required for the transport of CO2. In other Member States, there are specific
CO2 permits or permits for the transport of substances other than oil and gas. However, in most
Member States, the development of a specific regulatory framework for CO2, including attention for
its characteristics, is still ongoing. In Canada, the Pipeline Act requires a pipeline license holder to

                                                                                                     48
develop and implement a pipeline integrity management program, to ensure that pipelines are
capable of transporting material safely. It establishes the obligation to hold a license before
constructing a pipeline, or any part of a pipeline, or undertake any operations preparatory or
incidental to the construction of a pipeline. In the US, siting and licensing of new CO2 pipelines in
the US is governed by State law. There is no comprehensive national regulatory scheme for the
transport of CO2, but the USDOE has published a ”best practice” manual for CO2 transportation and
storage. Many state administrative codes require a pipeline to be licensed or permitted prior to
operation. Existing pipelines must remain in compliance with any permit or license conditions
established at State level, as well as pipeline safety regulations established by the USDOT Office of
Pipeline Safety (OPS)115. To the extent CO2 is transported via either road or rail in the United
States, the Department of Transport’s regulations related to transportation of hazardous materials
would apply. Offshore pipelines are regulated by both OPS and the Minerals Management Service
(MMS), an agency of the United States Department of Interior (USDOI) 116. In Australia, the legal
requirements for pipelines depend on whether they are located offshore or onshore. For offshore
pipeline activities, an environmental plan and pipeline management plan is required for the
construction and operation of all pipelines conveying petroleum. It should be noted though that
these would not apply to CO2 pipelines. For onshore pipeline activities, a Construction
Environmental Management Plan and Construction Safety Management Plan are required prior to
the construction of all pipelines. A consultation plan is also required prior to a proponent giving
notice to each land owner and occupier of intention to enter land or of a pipeline corridor. An
Operational Safety Management Plan is required prior to the consent to operate.

Rules governing the CO2 transportation infrastructure authorization therefore vary across
jurisdictions. In the EU there are no specific rules applicable to the authorization of transportation
infrastructure and the authorization process is covered by EIA rules and regulated in Member
States. Similarly in the US, there are no specific rules regarding new CO2 pipelines – this is
governed at State level and the Department of Energy has published a best practice manual for CO2
transportation and storage. As regards existing pipelines, these must respect the conditions set out in
the license. Under Canadian and Australian law, pipeline management plans are required. It will
therefore be important to assess the application of existing legislation for pipelines and check the
need for amendments or detailed guidance in relation to the transport of CO2. Specific requirements
for CO2 pipelines are considered necessary in relation to the corrosion of pipelines as a consequence
of CO2 transport and in relation to specific pressure requirements for CO2 due to variation in
pressure and temperature.

2.3.13 Third-party access to transportation infrastructure

In cases of spare capacity in a CO2 pipeline, network of pipelines or storage site, issues of third-
party access can occur, given that national authorities have an interest in optimizing the use of that
capacity.

According to the IEA, if operators try to prevent potential new connectors from entering the
market, without any reasonable technical or economic grounds, the relevant authority may consider
implementing laws that set conditions by which operators are obliged to grant third-party access to
CO2 pipelines and storage sites. Complementary risk allocation, access and financial security
mechanism provisions may then also be required. The IEA recommends considering certain factors
in the regulation of access to transportation infrastructure, including the need for rapid CCUS
deployment for achieving large-scale reductions in CO2 emissions; the need to bring in smaller

players that could reduce their entry costs through accessing existing infrastructure and to provide
incentives for first movers to ensure that the infrastructure is built. It also recommends taking into
account technical limitations, such as reduced pipeline capacity which is not designed to match the
CO2 output of capture facilities. Before implementing forced third-party access, parties should also
be encouraged to find suitable resolutions to allow access to third parties such as ‘open season’
subscription periods.

In the EU, Member States must establish measures to ensure that potential users are able to obtain
access to transport networks and storage sites, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The
CSS Directive provides Member States with a margin of discretion in shaping the third-party access
requirements. Some considerations should be taken into account when providing access to
transportation networks and storage sites, including whether the storage area can reasonably be
made available; the proportion of CO2 reduction obligations that the Member State concerned
intends to meet through CO2 capture and storage, any incompatibilities of technical specifications
which cannot be reasonably overcome and the interests of all other users of the storage or the
network or relevant processing or handling facilities who may be affected. Access may be refused
on the grounds of lack of capacity. Duly substantiated reasons must be given for such refusal. Some
Member States, such as Belgium, have adopted more detailed implementing legislation in relation
to third-party access including the establishment of a dispute settlement mechanism. In Alberta,
there are no regulatory requirements in place for third party access to CO2 pipelines. The system
used for upstream oil and gas pipelines is the common carrier order; however sections 48, 49 and 55
of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act do not include CO2 pipelines in the common carrier system. In
the US, third party access to transportation infrastructure is regulated at State level. The APEC
report on CCS notes that a lack of a regulation for the pipeline network in the US is not considered
a major barrier for early deployment of CCS demonstration projects, as the large projects generally
selected storage sites within a short distance from the capture facilities. This precluded the need for
more comprehensive regulation at this point117. In Australia, third party access is regulated by
Australia’s third party access law (the 1874 Trade Practices Act) which establishes legal rights for
third parties to share the use of particular infrastructure services which are of national significance,
on reasonable terms and conditions. The regime applies to both privately and publicly owned
infrastructure.

Approaches to third-party access to transportation infrastructure therefore vary across the
jurisdictions analyzed. The EU and the US leave the regulation of third party access to be shaped at
Member State and State level, respectively. In Canada, there are no such measures in place and in
Australia rules relating to third party access to infrastructure services apply.

2.3.14 Transboundary movement of CO2

Capture, transportation and storage of CO2 can lead to potential transboundary issues, such as the
capture in one jurisdiction and subsequent cross border transportation for storage in a different
jurisdiction or a use of storage complexes that span jurisdictional borders. It could also lead to
unintended migration or leakage of injected CO2 in the sub-surface across jurisdictional borders. In
light of these potential issues, the IEA recommends transboundary regulatory co-operation as
regards applications and authorizations; reviews; monitoring requirements; inspections; closure
requirements; post-closure requirements; and the handling of long-term responsibility for the
storage site and any associated liabilities. It also calls for the co-ordination of regulatory oversight
for authorizations, monitoring and reporting of projects in which transboundary issues can occur

and considering harmonization of fiscal and market regulations for CCUS operations. It should be
noted in this context, however, that international law restrictions currently still apply to the
transboundary movement of CO2 due to prohibition of such transportation in the London Protocol.
While the Protocol has been amended to allow for the transboundary movement of CO 2, this
amendment has not yet entered into force pending ratification by sufficient parties to the Protocol.

The objective of the London Convention and Protocol is to promote the effective control of all
sources of marine pollution. Contracting Parties are required to take effective measures to prevent
pollution of the marine environment caused by dumping at sea (see articles I and II of the
Convention and article 2 of the Protocol). The purpose of the London Convention more specifically
is to control all sources of marine pollution and prevent pollution of the sea through regulation of
dumping into the sea of waste materials. "Sea" is indeed defined in the London Protocol as “all
marine waters other than the internal waters of States, as well as the seabed and the subsoil thereof;
it does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed only from land”. Under the law of the seas,
internal waters are under broad terms indeed defined as the territorial sea (12 nautical miles), the
contiguous zone (24nm), and the exclusive economic zone (200nm).

In relation to internal waters, Article 7 of the London Protocol states that:
“1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Protocol, this Protocol shall relate to internal waters
only to the extent provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3.
2 Each Contracting Party shall at its discretion either apply the provisions of this Protocol or adopt
other effective permitting and regulatory measures to control the deliberate disposal of wastes or
other matter in marine internal waters where such disposal would be "dumping" or "incineration at
sea" within the meaning of article 1, if conducted at sea.
3 Each Contracting Party should provide the Organization with information on legislation and
institutional mechanisms regarding implementation, compliance and enforcement in marine internal
waters. Contracting Parties should also use their best efforts to provide on a voluntary basis
summary reports on the type and nature of the materials dumped in marine internal waters.”

Mexico is a party to the London Protocol since 2006. The US, on the other hand, have ratified the
London Convention and signed the London Protocol. However, they have not ratified the London
Protocol.

Under EU law the CSS Directive provides, very generally, that in cases of transboundary movement
of CO2, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned must jointly meet the
requirements of the CCS Directive and other relevant EU legislation. It also provides for dispute
settlement in the event of cross-border disputes. In the US and the Alberta Province in Canada
there are no regulations about transboundary movement of CO2. The North American Agreement on
Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) provides a process allowing members of the North American
public to make an assertion that a NAAEC country is failing to effectively enforce its
environmental law. This process is known as the Submissions on Enforcement Matters (SEM
process). This process applies only if the country’s legislation does not allow transboundary
movements. There are no regulations about transboundary movement of CO2 in Australia either.
Australian Regulatory Guiding Principles recognize that CCUS projects should follow the
principles of customary international law, such as the duty not to cause transboundary
environmental damage. The consistency of CCUS with Australia’s international obligations will
depend on the individual circumstances of particular CCUS projects.

The EU, therefore, is the only jurisdiction among those analyzed to provide limited and general
measures regarding transboundary movement of CO2. In the US and Canada, the North American
Agreement on Environmental Cooperation would apply only if the country’s legislation does not

                                                                                                   51
allow transboundary movements. Finally, transboundary transportation of CO2 is currently still
prohibited between parties to the London Protocol, pending the ratification of the amendment to its
Article 6.

2.3.15 Definitions and terminology applicable to CO 2 storage

The IEA recommends that in the context of a CCS regulatory framework, definitions should be
required to describe the scope and meaning of certain technical terms; clarify the meaning of
certain events, activities or processes; and implement certain standards, conventions or agreed
requirements as set out in international legal instruments. The definitions should provide clarity to
enable effective enforcement, while also being flexible enough to enable the regulatory framework
to cover a range of possible CO2 sources and geological settings.

In the EU, the CCS Directive provides an extensive list of definitions of the main terms used,
including for example, geological storage, storage site, migration, leakage. In Alberta, the Carbon
Capture and Storage Funding Act does not define storage or storage right. In the US, definitions are
provided for the following terms: Area of Review (AoR); geologic sequestration (GS); geologic
sequestration project; injectate118; injection zone; pore space; post-injection site care and site
closure. Australian law provides definitions for greenhouse gas sequestration infrastructure and
underground geological storage formation.

All the jurisdictions analyzed provide definitions relating to CCUS. Canada, however, does not
define storage or storage right.

2.3.16 Third-party access to storage site

Similarly to section 2.3.13 above regarding third party access to transportation infrastructure, issues
of third-party access can also occur in cases of spare capacity of a storage site. As noted above, the
IEA recommends that relevant authorities consider implementing laws that set conditions by which
operators are obliged to grant third-party access to storage sites.

The EU requirements for third-party access to storage sites are the same as for third-party access to
transportation infrastructure networks (see 2.3.13 above) and Member States have a margin of
discretion in shaping the third-party access requirements. In Alberta, there is currently no
regulation that deals directly with third party access or open access to pore space or CO2
sequestration. Some portions of the Mines and Minerals Act and Carbon Sequestration Tenure
Regulation allow for the transfer of tenure between parties, mandating the Minister of Energy to
reduce the area of a permit or lease upon application of the permittee or lessee.
In the US, third party access to a storage site is regulated at State level. In Australia, the GGS Act
provides for third parties and existing injection and monitoring license holders to enter into
agreements for the injection and storage of CO2 in a storage site in the existing license area,
provided the agreement conforms with the license and the Act more broadly. If the parties cannot
reach such an agreement, the third party can apply to the Minister for a binding direction for the
third party to inject and store CO2 in the relevant storage formation, provided various conditions are
satisfied. The existing license holder will, however, be entitled to compensation in respect of such
third party access.

In the EU and the US, third party access requirements are therefore shaped at Member State and
State level, respectively. In Australia, third-parties can apply for a binding direction to obtain access

                                                                                                      52
to the storage sites which will be granted under certain conditions. Australian law provides for
compensation to the license holder in such a case. In Canada, there are no specific measures in
place. However, the Mines and Minerals and Carbon sequestration framework allows for the
transfer of tenure between parties.

2.3.17 Authorization of storage site exploration activities

Exploration activities involve a variety of technical, geological, environmental, and economic and
political considerations which should be reflected as components of an exploration authorization
application. The IEA highlights key areas that an exploration authorization should address:
 Clarification of rights, also in the context of other types of authorizations that may have been
    issued for the same area.
 Exclusivity on information and development
 Time-limiting authorizations to prevent operators from banking the rights and stopping other
    players from entering the market.
 Storage market operation (efficiency and effectiveness).
The IEA also recommends developing similar authorization procedures to those used in sub-surface
exploration, such as mineral and mining, or oil and gas exploration taking into account competition
with other users.

In the EU, exploration may be carried out to assess storage capacity in part or in the whole territory
of a Member State concerned. No exploration can be carried out without an exploration permit.
Procedures for the granting of exploration permits must be open to all entities possessing the
necessary capacities and such permits must be granted and refused on the basis of objective,
published and non-discriminatory criteria. Details of such procedures are to be decided at Member
State level. The duration of a permit must not exceed the period necessary to carry out the
exploration for which it is granted.

In Canada, exploration activities firstly require coming to an agreement with the land owner
through direct negotiation, similar to oil and gas activities. Operators can acquire a permit for the
evaluation of a potential storage site to investigate the geology and determine the suitability of the
site for CO2 sequestration. The duration of an evaluation permit is five years.

In the US, exploration rights to CCUS formations can be obtained, either through the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) land use authorization process, or through exploration leases for private
lands. In 2011 the BLM also issued guidance on processing land use proposals and permit
applications for exploration and site characterization studies for potential subsurface carbon
sequestration projects on BLM lands. A Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA)
permit will be used to authorize proposed CO2 GS exploration and site characterization studies on
public lands. Permits have a limited term of three years and may be renewed once, for a maximum
term of six years.

In Australia, only offshore storage formations that are suitable for the permanent storage of at least
100,000 metric tons of CO2 or another greenhouse gas, injected at a particular point or points over a
particular period, are eligible to host CO2 sequestration activities under the OPGGS Act. If a party
holding a greenhouse gas assessment permit, holding a lease or injection license, or a petroleum
production license, believes that part of a geological formation covered by the title is an eligible
greenhouse storage formation for the purposes of offshore storage formations, the party must first
apply to the Minister for a declaration that the formation is an identified greenhouse gas formation
for the purposes of the Act, before applying for a greenhouse gas holding lease or injection license
for the formation. The GGGS Act establishes the greenhouse gas sequestration exploration permits.

                                                                                                   53
An exploration permit expires on the fifth anniversary of the day on which it is registered in the
greenhouse gas sequestration register.

Requirements therefore vary from country to country from a single authorization or license to a
combination of multiple authorizations and/or licenses.

2.3.18 Regulating site selection and characterization activities

According to the IEA, the detailed steps and information to establish an approval system for a
storage site and exploration activities could be best implemented through secondary regulatory
instruments and should focus on performance characteristics to be achieved in a storage site.
Technical requirements’ methodology for site characterization may include data collection;
performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; risk assessment; and appropriate modes of operation
and closure.

In the EU, the CCS Directive allows Member States to prohibit any storage in parts of or in their
whole territory, as well as to determine the areas in which storage sites may be selected. In the last
case, Member States must carry out an assessment of storage capacity available in their territory,
through data collection, building a three-dimensional static geological earth model, characterization
of the storage dynamic behavior, and sensitivity characterization and risk assessment. In Canada,
CCS projects begin with a site selection and characterization period during which the proponent has
to apply for a tenure agreement for the chosen site including granting of all initial regulatory
approvals required. An exploration of oil and gas characterizing the subsurface geology of the
province will be preliminary to the choice of the most suitable sites for CO 2 sequestration119.
Injection wells must meet the requirements set out by both the AER (Alberta Energy Regulator)
Directive 065 (requiring that all proposed injection wells are completed and test results are available
prior to scheme approval) and Directive 051 (clarifying completion, logging, testing, monitoring,
and application requirements for injection and disposal wells, and specifying procedures to protect
the subsurface environment). The application has to be reviewed and approved by the AEP (which
may impose additional conditions). Once the AER final approval is obtained, the project can
commence subject to conditions and regulatory requirements. In the US, in order to receive the
authorization to construct the well, owners or operators have to submit both a Class VI permit
application and the data necessary to demonstrate site suitability. The Class VI permit will include,
for example, geo-mechanical information; the seismic history, regional geology, hydrogeology, and
the geologic structure of the local area; baseline geochemical data on subsurface formations; maps,
cross sections and other characteristics of the AoR. The site characterization process consists of a
general characterization of regional and site geology, followed by a detailed characterization of the
injection zone and confining zones to be carried out once the injection well is drilled. In Australia,
the GGGS Act requires exploration permit holders to undertake a work program for site
characterization designed to:
     establish the characteristics and extent of any underground storage formations in the permit
         area;
     assess the feasibility of injecting CO2 (or another greenhouse gas substance) into any
         identified storage formations; and
     assess the suitability of any identified storage formations for permanent storage, in a
         manner that protects public health and the environment and will not compromise the
         integrity of the storage formation.
The Minister is in turn required to not grant an injection and monitoring license unless satisfied that,

119
    The data compiled for site selection may form part of the baseline data set in the monitoring, measurement and
verification (MMV) plan that will be developed for the project.

                                                                                                               54
among other things, the relevant storage formation is suitable for CO2 injection and storage, as per
the criteria outlined above.

While all jurisdictions analyzed provide for an approval system for storage sites on the basis of site
characterization studies, only the EU allows Member States to prohibit any storage in part of or in
their whole territory or to determine the areas in which storage sites may be selected. Moreover, the
EU provides the most detailed regulatory requirements for the modelling and data that shall be
collected as part of the site characterization study. These should ensure that a competent authority
and the operator have a thorough understanding of the site prior to any injection activities. It should
be noted in this context that oil producing countries might have such information more readily
available for EOR or storage in exhausted wells in case the information is required to be made
available to competent authorities.

2.3.19 Authorization of storage activities

As a storage authorization application generally requires disclosure of information on how the
project will be operated and closed, it is the key tool in ensuring that CCS takes place in an
environmentally safe way. The injection or storage permit contains the authorization by competent
authorities to proceed with the injection of CO2 for its permanent storage as well as an authorization
for the construction of associated infrastructure. The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework
recommends that the authorization process is preliminary to undertaking development activities and
provides the principal mechanism by which appropriate regulatory oversight of CO2 storage site
development and operation can be achieved. The authorization of storage activities covers both the
operation and closure periods of a CO2 storage project. As mentioned in the IEA Model it is
important to consider the need to limit the duration of the exploration authorization to ensure that
operators are actively exploring the site and the need to provide operators with preferential rights to
a storage authorization associated with an exploration authorization. This issue is addressed above.

The CCS Directive sets out the conditions according to which EU Member States can organize at
national level the permitting procedure (for example ensuring that all permits are granted on the
basis of objective, published and transparent criteria). Therefore, the permit is granted only if all
requirements of the CCS Directive, as well as of other relevant EU legislation, are met. Before an
application for a storage permit may be submitted to the competent national authority, the applicant
must carry out an environmental impact assessment. In the application for a storage permit,
potential operators need to provide the competent authority with information regarding, inter alia,
proof of their technical competence to operate a storage safely, description of the storage site and
the storage complex, the total quantity of CO2 to be injected in the chosen geological formation,
monitoring plans, corrective measures, a provisional post-closure plan and proof of financial
security. In Canada, in order to construct CO2 injection wells, a well license application must be
filed and the applicant must obtain clearance for the well pads and access roads. Additionally, the
Alberta Water Act requires approval and compensation for any permanent disturbances from well
pads or access roads to Class III or higher wetlands or waterbodies. Regarding the CO2 subsurface
storage scheme, the Mines and Minerals Act and the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation set
out the requirements for the lessee including submission to the Minister of a monitoring,
measurement and verification plan and a closure plan for the project. In the US, owners or
operators of Class VI wells must submit both a Class VI permit application and five project plans
that, once approved, are an enforceable part of the Class VI permit and must be amended
periodically. The required project plans will include: a Corrective Action Plan; a Testing and
Monitoring Plan; an Injection Well Plugging Plan; a Post-Injection Site Care (PISC) and Site
Closure Plan; an Emergency and Remedial Response Plan. Moreover, detailed operating
requirements are established for the injection of CO2. In Australia, in order to commence injection,

                                                                                                    55
an injection and monitoring plan and an operations’ plan have to be submitted and approved by the
Minister. The Well Operations Management Plan shall include provisions on the management of the
site during operations and for site closure. The holders of exploration permits and retention leases
authorities can apply for injection and monitoring licenses. For areas not covered by such
instruments, or by an expired or cancelled injection and monitoring license, the Minister can invite
applications for licenses. Moreover, the GGGS Act applies general operating conditions when
carrying out the injection and storage operations.

Overall, all jurisdictions therefore contain detailed requirements for the content of the applications
for storage and operation authorizations. Monitoring plans and closure plans are an integral part of
the application process from its inception onwards. The authorizations are mostly accompanied by
detailed operating conditions, either as part of general regulatory requirements to these activities or
as specific permitting conditions. Specific examples of regulatory frameworks are included in the
IEA Model.

2.3.20 International law for the protection of the marine environment

The two key international treaties on the matter are the 1972 IMO London Convention (and 1996
London Protocol) and the 1992 OSPAR Convention. Both instruments prevent the storage of CO2
in the water column or on the seabed and have been amended to allow, under certain conditions,
CO2 storage in sub-seabed geological formations. The IEA recommends that parties to either one or
both instruments must ensure that regulatory frameworks developed for CO2 storage reflect the
obligations imposed under these conventions. Non-signatory parties may also wish to consider
including similar provisions in regulatory frameworks.

For an introduction to the relevant provisions of the London Protocol, see section 2.3.14 on
transboundary movement of CO2.

In the EU, as the 1996 London Protocol was adopted, pre-existing legal barriers to the geological
storage of CO2 under the seabed have been removed. In 2006, the Contracting Parties adopted
amendments to the Protocol allowing and regulating CO2 storage in geological formations under the
seabed. In 2009, an amendment was adopted to Article 6 of the London Protocol to exempt CO2 for
the purpose of injection from the prohibition of transboundary movement. However, to date only
the UK and the Netherlands have ratified this amendment. They have not yet entered into force.
The Contracting Parties to the 1992 OSPAR Convention adopted amendments to the Annexes to the
Convention in order to allow CO2 storage under the seabed. They also adopted a Decision to ensure
environmentally safe CO2 storage and Guidelines for Risk Assessment and Management of CO2
storage. In addition, a Decision to prohibit storage of CO2 into the water-column of the sea and on
the seabed has been issued. Canada is a party to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention) and the related
1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and
Other Matter, 1972, (the 1996 Protocol). The US ratified the London Convention in 1975. The
Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) is the US law that implements this
treaty. The US also signed the 1996 London Protocol in 1998, but has not yet ratified it. Australia
is party to both the 1972 London Convention and the 1996 London Protocol. Australia is also party
to the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships - MARPOL (as
amended by the Protocol of 1978)120 and the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea –


120
   The MARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by
ships from operational or accidental causes.

                                                                                                             56
UNCLOS121.

2.3.21 Project inspections

Provision for inspections (both periodic and ad hoc / routine and non-routine) should be included in
storage authorizations to allow for regulatory oversight (monitoring of compliance with the terms of
the authorization) to be enforced, as well as allowing flexibility in cases where an operator wishes
to extend the life of the storage operation. The IEA recommends the following general
requirements:
- Inspection objectives: at least direct site visits to examine surface facilities, verification of
     records concerning CO2 mass received, CO2 mass injected, any routine shut-down activities,
     any unplanned shutdowns or unintended incidents and review of monitoring results.
- Inspection frequency: variable according to particular practice in the region and depending on
     the site performance history. Good practice would suggest combinations of (i) annual reporting
     and review by the relevant authority (ii) at least annual or biannual routine inspections of
     operations (iii) at least annual third-party verification, with oversight from the relevant
     authority, (iv) non-routine inspections to investigate any reports of leakage, unintended
     migration or other significant irregularity, complaints or other situations as necessary.
The IEA also recommends that inspections should continue through closure period but frequency
may be modified depending on site-specific considerations and the level of confidence in storage
site performance.

In the EU each Member State is required to carry out routine and non-routine inspections of the
storage complex. Routine inspections must be carried out at least once a year until three years after
closure and every five years until transfer of responsibility to the competent authority has occurred.
Non-routine inspections must be carried out when a competent authority receives complaints about
damage to the environment and human health or reports about leverages. Inspections should include
activities such as visits of the surface installations, including the injection facilities, assessing the
injection and monitoring operations carried out by the operator, and checking all relevant records
kept by the operator. Details concerning the inspections are to be decided upon at national (Member
State) level. In Canada, the Mines and Minerals Act entitles the Minister, or a person designated by
the Minister, to investigate or inspect any well, installation, equipment or other facility used, or
formerly used, in connection with the injection of a substance into a subsurface reservoir for
sequestration. This Act provides for entry and access to relevant sites, and sets out requirements for
lessees, operators and other parties to render assistance, supply information and samples, and
provide access to any reports, plans, logs and other information. In the US, the Environmental
Protection Agency proposed annual external Mechanical Integrity Testing (MIT) using a tracer
survey, a temperature or noise log, a casing inspection log, or any other test the Director requires.
Owners or operators of CO2 injection wells must demonstrate external mechanical integrity at least
once annually during injection operations using a tracer survey or a temperature or noise log. In
Australia, under the GGGS Act, authorized inspectors can carry out inspections and have the
power to enter any premises believed to be used for a CO2 sequestration operation; inspect the
premises and anything on the premises; copy documents; seize items where necessary to prevent
their concealment, loss or destruction; test equipment; take photographs and audio and visual
recordings; and use assistants in exercising the above powers. The Minister has the power to
appoint greenhouse gas inspectors under the OPGGS Act.

Measures for inspections are therefore provided in all jurisdictions analyzed. In Australia and

121
    It is noted that the UNCLOS does not explicit mention CO2, and there has been some discussion as to whether CO2
falls within the definition of “waste”.

                                                                                                                57
Canada, inspections are carried out by authorized inspectors. In the EU details concerning the
inspection are left to the discretion of Member States. US law requires inspections through
mechanical integrity testing.

2.3.22 Monitoring, reporting and verification requirements of CO2 utilization and storage

Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) is important for safety and environmental
compliance, and project-based and national accounting of greenhouse gas emission reductions,
among other considerations. According to the IEA, a regulatory approach should be sufficiently
flexible in the way monitoring provisions are set down and will also need to be developed on a
case-by-case basis. The IEA therefore suggests that further technical guidance for monitoring plan
design in secondary legal instruments or in technical guidance documents may be appropriate. The
2006 IPCC GLs approach and reference sources should be used as minimum standards. Relevant
essential components to establish security and safety of storage operations should include
monitoring of surface facilities with standard monitoring techniques; monitoring the stored/injected
CO2 plume and an emissions inventory to quantify amounts of any CO2 leakage. Operators should
submit an initial monitoring plan/proposed monitoring portfolio as part of a storage authorization
application, accompanied by baseline survey data when necessary. There should be a provision for
post-implementation revision of the monitoring plan, for example to include any emerging
technologies; alter monitoring frequencies and/or change spatial locations and rationales, if
required, and respond to significant leakage, unintended migration or other irregularity. Monitoring
is also required after cessation of injection and possibly post-closure. Where other reporting
obligations exist, these should be, as much as possible, be integrated with reporting obligations of
CO2 storage sites or EOR operations. Detailed recommendations for the development of a
regulatory framework for MRV are included in the IEA Model Framework, UCL Legal
Programme122, WRI CCS Guidelines: Guidelines for Carbon Dioxide Capture, transport and
Storage123 and the USDOE Best Practices for Monitoring, Verification and Accounting of CO 2
Stored in Deep Geological Formation124.

In the EU, monitoring of the injection facilities, the storage complex and, where appropriate, the
surrounding environment must be carried out by the operator on the basis of a monitoring plan that
must be approved by the permitting authority in the authorization procedure. The monitoring plan
should cover the main stages of the project and should be updated at least every five years. Updated
plans must be submitted to the permitting authority for approval. On the basis of the monitoring
plan, the operator is obliged to carry out comprehensive monitoring of specific parameters, such as
pressure, temperature and seismic activity as well as the technology employed. The EU CCS
Directive explicitly lists the aspects that shall be covered by monitoring exercises, such as detecting
irregularities, migration, leakages, comparisons between actual and modelled behavior of CO 2,
impacts on the environment, etc. The operator must report to the competent authority at least once a
year with the results of the monitoring. He must immediately notify the competent authority in case
of leakages or significant irregularities.

In Canada, the Minister of Energy is responsible for the approval of Monitoring, Measure and
Verification (MMV) and closure plans, as part of the tenure application process125. The plan shall
present the MMV activities that will be undertaken by the operator, an analysis of the likelihood
that the operations will interfere with mineral recovery and other information requested by the
Minister. Updated MMV plans are submitted every three years along with an updated closure plan.
The closure plan shall provide an evaluation of whether the CO2 behaved in a manner consistent
with the geological interpretations and calculations submitted as part of the approval application.
The Canadian Standards Association have developed standards for CCUS, which cover risk
management, quantification and verification of storage which are now under consideration as
industry-wide international ISO standards126. During the injection period, monitoring is undertaken
to demonstrate compliance with legislation, applications and approvals. The regulations contain an
explicit obligation for the operator to comply with the approved MMV plan. Operators must submit
an annual report to the Minister of Energy containing the findings and observations from MMV
activities. The Alberta Province Regulatory Framework Assessment127 (RFA), which concluded in
2014, identified the MRV of CO2 sequestration projects as an area in the Alberta regulatory
framework which needed to be improved. The report noted that CO2 sequestration projects are not
explicitly required to submit risk assessments or monitor effects beyond the injection site. It
therefore recommended that MMV and closure plans be required to be based on a project-specific
risk assessment, and include the use of best available technologies to monitor the atmosphere,
surface, ground and surface water, and subsurface.

In the US, the Class VI Rule requires owners or operators of Class VI wells to perform several
types of activities during the lifetime of the project in order to ensure that the injection well
maintains its mechanical integrity, that fluid migration and the extent of pressure elevation are
within the limits described in the permit application, and that USDWs are not endangered128.
Testing and monitoring of GS sites is considered integral to the protection of underground sources
of drinking water (USDWs). Testing and monitoring is specifically required to determine whether
the sequestration projects are operating as permitted, to detect risks that may lead to the
endangerment of USDWs and to inform the possible re-evaluation of the AoR for Class VI
projects129. The Class VI Rule specifies the injection-phase testing and monitoring activities which
shall be carried out130 and the parameters that shall be covered. Moreover, the UIC Program
Director may specify any additional monitoring or modelling requirements he deems necessary. The
Post-Injection Site Care (PISC) refers to the time period immediately following cessation of
injection until site closure. Although there is no longer injection during this phase, the project still
poses some risk to USDWs due to elevated pressures and the presence of mobile-phase carbon
dioxide. Owners or operators of Class VI wells are required to prepare, maintain, and comply with a
PISC and Site Closure Plan131. Specifically, owners or operators must monitor the site to show the
position of the carbon dioxide plume and pressure front and demonstrate that USDWs are not
endangered during the approved PISC monitoring timeframe132. The purpose of these requirements
is to ensure that any risk to USDWs is detected and appropriate remediation/corrective action is

taken in the case of endangerment133. Site closure commences only when there is no longer a risk of
endangerment to USDWs and when authorized by the UIC Program Director. In Australia, under
the GGGS Act, before commencing injection of CO2 or other greenhouse gases, the holder of an
injection and monitoring license must submit to the Minister an injection and monitoring plan and
must report the outcomes of all monitoring and verification to the Minister. Reports are made
publicly available through the greenhouse gas sequestration register. Monitoring may also be
carried out by the Minister, who can keep specified accounts, records and other documents; collects
and retains specified cores, cuttings and samples; and submits specified reports, returns, other
documents, cores, cuttings and samples, in connection with greenhouse gas operations. Applications
for site closing certificates must include, among other things, the applicant’s suggested approach in
monitoring the stored greenhouse gas after issuance of the site closure certificate.

All the jurisdictions analyzed provide for monitoring, reporting and verification requirements of
CO2 utilization and storage, in particular through the preparation of a monitoring plan and annual
monitoring reports. The EU and United States have established very detailed monitoring and
reporting requirements, including testing and monitoring that shall be carried out, as well as
parameters to be covered. They have developed detailed guidance for the MRV of storage sites.
Canada has established broader MRV provisions. The Alberta Province RFA which concluded in
2014, identified this area as one where important gaps needed to be addressed, such as the coverage
of effects beyond the injection sites and full risk assessments.

2.3.23 Corrective and remediation measures

Corrective measures are required to protect human health and the environment, and to maintain the
efficacy of a CCS project as a CO2 emissions abatement method. Remediation is required to address
any damages associated with significant leakage, unintended migration or other irregularity in the
operation of a storage site. Any significant leakage, unintended migration or other irregularity in
storage site operations should therefore be corrected in a timely manner and damages remediated.
The IEA recommends that CO₂ regulatory frameworks should stipulate both the entity that is to be
financially liable for corrective measures and remediation measures and the entity required to
perform those measures. Given the very specific nature of the corrective and remediation measures
that may be required in the context of any given storage site or leakage event, discretion is usually
conferred on the relevant authority to determine when corrective and remediation measures are
necessary and what they will entail. In the event that CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere, measures
available to remediate the global effects are associated with liability provisions. The IEA Model
does not identify any reported requirements to correct or remediate CO2 leaks from CO2 storage
operations.

In the EU, the potential operator must include a corrective measures’ plan in the application for a
storage permit that must be approved by the permitting authority. If a CO2 leakage or any other
significant irregularity occurs, the operator must immediately inform the competent authority and
take corrective measures, as a minimum on the basis of the corrective measures ’ plan. The
competencies of the competent authority in the event of a CO2 leakage are wide, including requiring
the operator to take necessary corrective measure and they can be additional to those laid down in
the corrective measures’ plan. Remedial actions are also specified in the environmental liability
directive (ELD), which requires operators to take preventive measures when the environmental
damage has not yet occurred but there is an imminent threat of such damage occurring. In Canada
Alberta, there are no specific requirements to undertake corrective and remedial measures as part

of CO2 sequestration activities. The Mines and Minerals Act empowers the Lieutenant Governor in
Council to make regulations respecting remedial actions that a lessee must undertake, including
circumstances under which a remedial action plan must be prepared and submitted; the form,
content, submission, approval and amendment of plans; and reporting requirements. If the Minister
has reason to believe that operations are exposing others to the risk of damage or loss, the Minister
can authorize any person to enter and remain at the relevant site for the purposes of remedying
existing defaults and enforce compliance with any safety provisions required to eliminate the risk of
damage or loss and charge. In the US, an owner or operator of a Class VI well must prepare,
maintain, and implement an AoR and Corrective Action Plan that includes a description of how
corrective action will be performed on any artificial penetrations through the confining zone and
whether such action will be phased. In Australia, the GGGS Act requires that the operator report a
serious situation (including events such as leakage of stored CO2, behavior of CO2 other than as
anticipated, and compromise of the storage site as a result of CO2 injection) within the period of
time specified in the regulations. The Minister may direct the operator to inject or otherwise store
the CO2 in a particular manner, stop or suspend injection, inject CO2 at a specified location, or take
any other action, in order to remedy the situation. In case of a serious situation, the OPGGS Act
empowers the Minister to direct the license holder to undertake injection or storage operations
within the relevant storage formation in a specified manner, cease or suspend injection at a
particular site or into a particular storage formation, inject a greenhouse gas into the relevant storage
formation at a particular site, and undertake specified activities to eliminate, mitigate, manage or
remediate the serious situation.

Regulatory approaches to remedial and corrective measures differ slightly across the jurisdictions
analyzed, though most share the same features. In the EU and the US, potential operators must
prepare a corrective measures’ plan as part of the project application. Such a plan should identify
how specific emergencies will be dealt with. Furthermore, in most jurisdictions, the competent
authorities are provided with the rights to instruct operators to take specific corrective or remedial
measures or to take over control of the site for the implementation of such measures.

2.3.24 Liability during the project period

The entity best placed to bear liability for damage caused by a storage site during exploration,
operation and closure is the operator of the site. The IEA Model notes that leakage or unintended
migration of CO2 from storage sites can lead to a number of potential impacts, which can be
categorized in two main groups (i) Localized effects, i.e. environmental, health and safety (EHS)
risks and (ii) global effects, atmosphere – compromise of effectiveness of a CCUS project as a
climate change mitigation technology. Designing appropriate mechanisms to provide clarity on the
entity to be liable for global or local effects is vital when designing CCUS regulatory frameworks.
In the case where CO2 incentives have been provided to the operator for the CCUS operations, the
operator may also be responsible for making good any CO2 leakage into the atmosphere in the
context of the incentive scheme. Liability arising from CO2 releases or storage for localized effects
can fall under existing regulatory/administrative law (e.g. breach of authorization conditions),
criminal law (e.g. fraud, negligence, corporate manslaughter) or civil law (e.g. through damages to
third parties). The precise nature of the liability will depend on prevailing laws in the jurisdiction
where the site is located, the actions that give rise to any leakage event or unintended migration
(e.g. breach of authorization conditions by the operator, negligence) and the nature of any impacts
resulting from such events (i.e. level of harm)134. The regulatory framework should ensure that
authorization processes establish powers for the relevant authority to investigate and bring charges
in the event of a breach of authorization conditions. Any existing laws relating to industrial

                                                                                                      61
accidents, civil and environmental protection, and environmental liability should be thoroughly
reviewed. This may result in identifying required modifications to existing laws to include CO 2
storage sites within the scope of those laws135. Incentive schemes for CCUS are likely to create
performance-based payments linked to the amount of CO2 avoided through a project. In the event of
leakage, payments should be adjusted accordingly. CCUS regulatory frameworks should include
obligations for operators to make good any detected leakage or unintended migration, when
possible (see corrective or remediation measures). Requirements on operators to hold insurance or
other forms of financial security should be clearly articulated in any regulatory texts. Finally, CCUS
regulatory frameworks should impose a variety of obligations on storage site operators after
injection ceases, i.e. within the closure period. Responsibility for the site may be transferred to the
relevant authority with the storage site closure.

In the EU, liability for environmental damage, i.e. damage to natural habitats, protected species,
water and land, caused by CO2 storage is covered under the ELD. This Directive provides for
preventive and remedial measures to be taken by the operator and regulates the financial liability. In
principle, the operator must bear the costs for the preventive and remedial actions taken. However,
the operator cannot be required to bear these costs if he can prove that the environmental damage or
imminent threat of such damage was either (i) caused by a third party and occurred despite the fact
that appropriate safety measures were in place; or (ii) resulted from compliance with a compulsory
order or instruction from a public authority. In such cases, Member States must take the appropriate
measures to enable the operator to recover the costs incurred. Moreover, Member States may allow
the operator not to bear the cost of remedial actions where he demonstrates that he was not at fault
or negligent and that the environmental damage was caused by an emission or event fully in
accordance with the conditions of an authorization or according to the state of scientific and
technical knowledge at the time when the emission was released, the activity was not considered
likely to cause environmental damage. Finally, the competent authority can recover from financial
guarantees from the operator who has caused the damage or the imminent threat of damage, the
costs it has incurred in relation to the preventive or remedial actions taken. Liability for CO 2 leaks
into the atmosphere is regulated under the ETS Directive. In case of any such leaks, the operator of
a CO2 storage site must surrender carbon emission allowances under the ETS Directive. Under
Article 19 of the CCS Directive, the responsibility/liability of the operator of the storage place can
only start with the granting of the permit. It also ends after the withdrawal of the storage permit
pursuant to Article 11(3) of the Directive until the new storage permit is issued or the responsibility
to the competent authority after closure has been transferred. Prior to this, the liability will be linked
to the operator in charge of the activity. Hence, the operator in charge of capturing CO 2 will be
liable for any damage or leaked CO2 resulting from the capture activities. The same applies for the
operator of the transport of CO2. In Canada, a CCS tenure holder is fully liable for all of the CO2
injected into the subsurface and related Post-Closure Stewardship Fund (PCSF) payments under
normal operating conditions. Because potential orders for third party access would require an
operator to inject another party’s CO2, and not allow other operators into the storage site, liability
(including PCSF payments) for the CO2 should continue to rest with the tenure holder136. The IEA
CCS Regulatory reviews note that, in the Alberta province, the risk of projects becoming orphaned
during the operation phase is not adequately covered: there is not a legally responsible or financially
able party to deal with abandonment and closure137. In the US, CO2 itself is not listed as a hazardous
substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA) which establishes environmental liability requirements. However, the CO2 stream may
contain a listed hazardous substance (such as mercury) or may mobilize substances in the

subsurface that could react with ground water to produce listed hazardous substances (such as
sulphuric acid). Whether such substances may result in CERCLA liability from a GS facility
depends entirely on the composition of the specific CO2 stream and the environmental media in
which it is stored (e.g., soil or ground water). CERCLA exempts from liability under CERCLA
section 107, 42 U.S.C. 9607, certain “Federally permitted releases” (FPR) as defined i n CERCLA,
42 U.S.C. 9601(10), which would include the permitted injectate stream138 as long as it is injected
and behaves in accordance with the permit requirements. Class VI permits will need to be carefully
structured to ensure that they prevent potential releases from the well, which are outside the scope
of the Class VI permit and thus not considered federally permitted releases. Under current SDWA
provisions, USEPA does not have authority to transfer liability from one entity (i.e., owner or
operator) to another139. Under SDWA authority, owners or operators of injection wells must ensure
protection of USDWs from endangerment and are subject to liability for enforcement under the Act.
Class VI Rule requires that an owner or operator must conduct monitoring as specified in the
Director-approved PISC and site closure plan following the cessation of injection until the owner or
operator can demonstrate to the Director that the geologic sequestration project no longer poses an
endangerment to USDWs. In Australia, the GGGS Act imposes a number of operational
requirements that must be observed during CO2 sequestration activities. Failure to comply with such
operational requirements, including, for example, the management of the site in a proper and
workmanlike manner, or preventing leakages, is subject to penalties. Operators must hold insurance
against expenses or liabilities from the undertaking of operations140. The OPGGS Act requires
greenhouse gas title holders to undertake exploration or injection operations to comply with specific
operational requirements, similar to those set out in the GGGS Act141.

In all jurisdictions, operators will thus be held liable for any environmental damage caused by the
operation of the site, mostly subject to tort requirements. In civil law traditions, this will mostly be
based on civil responsibility legislation set out in Civil Codes, whereas liability in common law
systems will mostly be developed through general common law principles and case-law. In most
jurisdictions, there are liability requirements for fault or a lack of taking the necessary precautions,
in Australia, for instance defined as proper management of the site. In certain aggravated cases, an
operator can also be subject to criminal sanctions as identified in the country´s criminal legislation.

2.3.25 Liability during the post-closure period

The issue of long-term liability has been seen as one of the most challenging and complex issues
associated with the regulation of CO2 storage activities142. It is also generally considered as one of
the most important issues to address in a regulatory framework prior to the development of CCUS
activities. The objective of a CCUS project is to enable permanent storage of CO2. As a
consequence, liability for a storage project might well extend long beyond the lifetime of the
operator carrying out the storage operation. A particular issue to address in this context is the issue
of bankruptcy of operators following post-closure of the site. Long-term liability for CO2 storage
activities is therefore usually addressed by means of a transfer of responsibility from the operator to
the competent authority. In this case, the operator is generally required to satisfy the relevant
authority of negligible risk of future leakage or other irregularity in the storage site, before the

relevant authority will assume responsibility for the storage site143. Sometimes, long-term liability is
not discussed and it is assumed that the operator retains responsibility for a storage site in
perpetuity144. This approach is, however, raised as an area of concern by industry as it creates less
legal certainty. Finally, where operators are state-owned, clear separation of ownership may not be
apparent and the issue of transferring responsibility may not arise145. In the predominant model for
managing liability, the liability is transferred to a public body after closure once a series of
conditions have been met. Where the pore space was owned or leased by a private entity during the
operational phase, the rights to the pore space will have to be transferred to the public body taking
on the liability for the site146. Following a transfer of responsibility, the relevant authority may
undertake periodic monitoring in order to gain continued assurances regarding the security of CO2
storage147. A transfer of responsibility may have financial implications for relevant authorities, so a
regulatory framework envisaging transfer of responsibility shall appropriately manage the resulting
risks for the relevant authority. The most effective way to manage these risks is to ensure that good
practice is required across the life cycle of CCUS projects in structuring regulatory approaches, and
that these practices are effectively enforced. Also, financial contributions may be required in order
to cover the costs associated with post-closure stewardship. This is addressed in the next point.
Finally, it should be noted that aspects of long-term liability may also be addressed by other
regulatory provisions, not specifically tailored towards CCUS projects. For example, criminal law
and tort requirements could equally apply, for instance, to cover a fault by the operator.

In the EU, specific long-term liability requirements have been established for CCUS projects in the
EU CCS Directive. When a storage site has been closed, the operator remains responsible for the
site for a minimum of 20 years148 afterwards. The liability conditions are the same as during the
operation period of the storage site (see section above). In case a storage site has been closed after
withdrawal of a storage permit, the competent authority immediately becomes responsible and
liable for the storage site. In this case, the liability of the competent authority is the same as the
liability of the operator during the operation period of the storage site. The competent authority can
recover from the operator, including by drawing on the financial security, the costs incurred in
relation to remedial and preventive actions taken after the closure of the site. After the 20 year
period passes, liability for the CO2 storage site is transferred to the competent authority on the
condition that the operator has provided evidence that the CO2 will be completely and permanently
contained. The liability of the competent authority is the same as the liability of the operator during
the operation period of the storage site. The competent authority can recover from the financial
contribution provided by the operator (for details, see section below) the costs incurred in relation to
remedial and preventive actions taken after the closure of the site. The Canadian Mines and
Minerals Act sets out the obligations that the Government of Alberta will assume when it issues a
closure certificate. The closure process will start when the lessees summit an initial closure plan; it
continues with interim closure plans submitted every three years in the injection period; and the
final closure plan which is submitted to enter the closure period. To conclude, the final closure and
MMV report are submitted as part of a closure certificate application149. The Government of Alberta
will assume ownership and responsibility for injected CO2, and any of the associated risks. At the
end of a project, a closure certificate is required to close a site and transfer long-term liability to the

Government of Alberta150. The certificate is issued when the operator demonstrates he has complied
with the monitoring and closure requirements, set out in the Oil and Conservation Act, complied
with EPEA requirements and the closure period has been finally concluded. Alberta legislation
allows the transfer of responsibility through a closure certification contained in section 120(1)
Mines and Minerals Act, if the operator satisfies the following requirements151:
      the lessee has performed all closure activities in accordance with regulations;
      the lessee has abandoned all wells and facilities in accordance with the requirements under
          the OGCA;
      the lessee has complied with the reclamation requirements under the Environmental
          Protection and Enhancement Act, the closure period specified in the regulations has passed;
      the conditions specified in the regulations have been met; and
      the captured carbon dioxide is behaving in a stable and predictable manner, with no
          significant risk of future leakage.
The Alberta Province Regulatory Framework Assessment, which concluded in 2014, highlighted a
number of important gaps in the regulatory framework for closure of the site and associated
liabilities152. The report noted that the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation provides little detail
on what a closure plan must contain. The Mines and Minerals Act does not specify what
performance criteria must be met to receive a closure certificate and assumed liabilities by the
Government of Alberta do not include liability for CO2 credits under climate change legislation.
These issues were highlighted as important regulatory gaps. In the US, once an owner or operator
has met all regulatory requirements under Section 146 for Class VI wells and the Director has
approved site closure, the owner or operator will generally no longer be subject to enforcement
under the SDWA for non-compliance with UIC regulatory requirements153. However, an owner or
operator may be held liable for regulatory non-compliance under certain circumstances, even after
site closure is approved, such as where the owner or operator provided erroneous data to support
approval of site closure. Additionally, an owner or operator may always be subject to an order the
Administrator deems necessary to protect the health of persons after site closure if there is fluid
migration that causes or threatens imminent and substantial endangerment to a USDW. For
example, the Administrator may issue an order if a well may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to the health of persons, and the State and local authorities have not acted to protect
the health of such persons. The order may include commencing a civil action for appropriate relief.
If the owner or operator fails to comply with the order, they may be subject to a civil penalty for
each day in which such a violation occurs or failure to comply continues. Furthermore, after site
closure, an owner or operator may, depending on the scenario, remain liable under tort and other
remedies, or under other Statutes including, but not limited to the Clean Air Act, CERCLA and
RCRA. The Australian Government can assume long term liability for CO2 injected into a
formation fifteen years after injection operations have ceased, where a “closure assurance period” in
respect of the formation has elapsed154. The Victoria legal framework provides the conditions for
the Minster to give consent to the surrender of authorities relating to onshore CCS, and provides for
two distinct tests. The GGGS Act deals with the operator’s own performance standards and requires

the Minister to be satisfied that the operator has complied with all the requirements of the
legislation relating to the authority and the conditions of the authority, and has plugged or closed off
all wells made in the authority area155. Even where they are not satisfied that these condition have
been met, the Minister may still accept surrender where satisfied that the failure to comply with
conditions ‘was the result of one or more events beyond the control of the holder of the
authority”156. Also, Section 170 of the GGGS Act provides a separate test of environmental criteria
which must also be met, and is not subject to the section 168 override proviso, where events were
beyond the control of the holder of the authority. The Minister must be of the opinion that157:
     the greenhouse gas substance that has been injected into an underground geological storage
         formation in the license area is behaving and will continue to behave in a predictable
         manner;
     the license holder has reduced the risks associated with the permanent storage of the
         greenhouse gas substance to as low as is reasonably practicable; and
     the stored greenhouse gas substance will not present a risk to public health or the
         environment.
In addition, the operator must, under section 170, provide detailed information concerning the
conditions of the storage site, an assessment of potential migration and leakage, a risk management
plan in the event of leakage, and a long term monitoring and verification plan. It is important to note
that liability transferred includes the future responsibilities under environmental laws, although are
not specified. However, there is no transfer or indemnification in respect of liabilities for torts158.

2.3.26 Financial contributions to post-closure stewardship

A financial contribution can provide a means by which the operator bears some financial
responsibility for any long-term risks and cost implications involved in CO2 storage. Where long-
term responsibility for a storage site is transferred to the relevant authority, CCS regulatory
frameworks may reduce the financial exposure of the relevant authority by requiring the operator to
contribute to the costs associated with long-term stewardship of the site159. This contribution can be
accrued over the course of the project or simply be required at the time of storage site closure
authorization160. By requiring a financial contribution to post-closure stewardship, the relevant
authority does not have to carry the financial burden for the long-term liability, unless any financial
liability incurred exceeds the contribution received161.

In the EU, the operator is required to make a financial contribution available to the competent
authority before the transfer of responsibility for a storage site after its closure takes place. This
contribution must take into account the characteristics of the storage complex, elements relating to
the history of storing CO2 and must at least cover the anticipated cost of monitoring of the site for a

period of 30 years162. This contribution can also be used to cover the costs incurred by the
competent authority after transfer of the responsibility of the site. The European Commission has
issued guidelines for the estimation of the amount of the financial contribution 163. In 2010, the
Canadian Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act created the Post-closure
Stewardship Fund (PCSF) which assumes certain liabilities and obligations of the lessee upon the
issuance of a closure certificate. The PCSF was established to cover the costs associated with some
of those assumed liabilities and obligations in the post-closure period, and to protect the Alberta
public from bearing those costs164. The Mines and Minerals Act establishes the PCSF and sets out
the allowable uses165. Currently, the PCSF can be used for monitoring injected CO2, paying for
expenses related to orphan facilities and fulfilling the other obligations assumed by the Government
of Alberta upon issuance of a closure certificate. The Government of Alberta should set a PCSF rate
(fee per metric ton of injected CO2) for each project individually166. This means the rate would be
calculated based only on the risks and cost obligations of each respective project. In the US, owners
or operators of Class VI wells are required to demonstrate and maintain financial responsibility to
cover the cost of corrective action, injection well plugging, PISC and site closure, and emergency
and remedial response. The Class VI Rule167 identifies the following qualifying financial
instruments for Class VI wells, all of which must be sufficient to address endangerment of USDWs.
A trust fund in which owners or operators set aside funds with a third party trustee sufficient to
cover estimated costs may be established. Owners or operators may use a payment surety bond or a
performance surety bond to guarantee that financial responsibility will be fulfilled. A letter of credit
is a credit document, issued by a financial institution, guaranteeing that a specific amount of money
will be available to a designated party under certain conditions, may be used. The owner or operator
may also obtain an insurance policy to cover the estimated costs of GS activities requiring financial
responsibility. Owners or operators may self-insure through a financial test provided certain
conditions are met. Finally, owners or operators may deposit money to an escrow account to cover
financial responsibility requirements. This account must segregate funds sufficient to cover
estimated costs for GS financial responsibility from other accounts and uses. In addition to these
instruments, EPA anticipates that new instruments that may be tailored to meet GS needs may
emerge, and may be determined appropriate for use by the Director for the purpose of financial
responsibility demonstrations. In line with USEPA Class VI Rule, North Dakota appropriated funds
from the State’s general fund to the Carbon Dioxide Storage Facility Administrative Fund168. The
Carbon Dioxide Trust Fund mandates the Industrial Commission to charge a fee on each metric ton
of CO2 injected. The per metric ton fee amount is set by rule and based on the Industrial
Commission’s anticipated expenses associated with the long-term monitoring and management of a
closed storage facility169. In Australia, the GGGS Act requires each holder of an injection and
monitoring license to pay an annual amount towards the estimated long-term monitoring and
verification costs for the storage site, as set out in the approved injection and monitoring plan 170.
The amount is to be determined as a percentage, fixed by the Minister, of the total estimated cost of
long-term monitoring and verification for the site. Where an injection and monitoring license is to
be surrendered, before such surrender the license holder must pay the remaining long-term
monitoring and verification costs not already paid171. Any excess payment must, however, be

injection licenses to make direct financial contributions to long term stewardship during the license
period, it does provide that a site closing certificate will only be issued once the operator has
provided security to cover the Commonwealth’s estimated costs in monitoring the long term
behavior of stored greenhouse gases172; and if, following issuance of a site closure certificate, the
State incurs reasonable costs or expenses in carrying out the monitoring program specified in the
pre-certificate notice, these costs and expenses may be recovered as a debt173.

It can be concluded that all jurisdictions analyzed foresee, to some extent, financial contributions
for the long-term liability associated with CO2 storage. However, in line with the legal traditions in
the jurisdictions investigated, common law systems such as the US, usually provide a stronger
responsibility for ensuring necessary funds to the operator, including for long-term liability. In the
US legal systems, class action suits for damage to the environment or public health are more
common legal tools than in other jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions, such as the EU, with a stronger
emphasis on the precautionary principle, follow a preventive approach whereby funds shall be
transferred to the competent authorities together with the responsibility for the site. It is therefore
important to tailor any long-term liability requirements and associated financial stewardship
provisions to the legal traditions and particularities of the legal system in each country.

2.3.27 Using CCS for biomass-based sources

The issue of using biomass-based sources is not currently addressed in any of the regulatory
frameworks.

2.3.28 Enhanced hydrocarbon recovery with CCS

CO2 can also be used with a view to enhancing hydrocarbon recovery (EOR). In this context, a
project can be a mere EOR project, with the sole purpose of enhancing hydrocarbon recovery. A
project might also be a joint EOR/CCS project whereby CO2 is injected for the dual purpose of
enhancing hydrocarbon recovery and preventing CO2 from reaching the atmosphere. The project
balances these two objectives with the possibility of optimizing either objective. Weyburn in
Canada is an example of a joint EOR/CCS project. Finally, a project may commence as an EOR
project and change into a CO2 storage project after hydrocarbon recovery has ceased.174 Use of CO2
to enhance oil recovery can be important in lowering barriers to carbon capture and storage 175. The
IEA report notes that, although CCS, joint EOR/CCS and EOR projects are all likely to result in
significant quantities of CO2 being geologically stored, EOR projects differ from the other two
types of projects in a number of important ways. Most importantly, in EOR projects, monitoring the
CO2 plume for unintended migration and leakage is not routinely undertaken (other than where this
has implications for oil recovery), which means verification of CO2 stored is not possible; therefore,
a project cannot be considered a CCUS project. From a regulatory perspective, the IEA report notes
that EOR operations will be governed by prevailing rules on pipeline construction and operation,
oilfield management and decommissioning procedures. Given the different approaches and
objectives of EOR as compared to CCS, CCS regulatory standards for long-term storage and for
monitoring and verifying injections should apply when: hydrocarbon recovery operations at a site
come to a close and the operator wishes to convert the site to a pure CO2 storage operation; and for

Enhanced hydrocarbon recovery is not covered by the EU CCS Directive. This can mostly be
explained by the fact that the EU has very few oil-producing countries. As a consequence, there is
no incentive for the EU to regulate and harmonize applicable requirements across Member States.
Any existing pollution prevention requirements will be applicable across the EU, including on sites
where EOR takes place. Any oil-producing Member States will be able to prepare national
requirements for such operations. However, when EOR is combined with geological storage of
CO2, the provisions of the CCS Directive would be applicable. In this case, the provisions of the
CCS Directive concerning leakage would not apply to quantities of CO2 released from surface
installations which do not exceed what is necessary in the normal process of extraction of
hydrocarbons, and which do not compromise the security of the geological storage or adversely
affect the surrounding environment. Such releases would be covered by the inclusion of storage
sites in the ETS Directive, which requires surrender of emissions’ trading allowances for any leaked
emissions. Canada contains more detailed arrangements for EOR operations. Approval for the
operation of a CO2-EOR scheme in Alberta is the responsibility of the AER under the Oil and Gas
Conservation Act. This Act defines “enhanced recovery” as the increased recovery from a pool
achieved by artificial means or by the application of energy extrinsic to the pool, where artificial
means or application include pressuring, cycling, pressure maintenance or injection to the pool of a
substance or form of energy, but does not include the injection in a well of a substance or form of
energy for the sole purpose of: (i) aiding in the lifting of fluids in the well, or (ii) stimulation of the
reservoir at or near the well by mechanical, chemical, thermal or explosive means176. Directive 065
applications are reviewed to ensure hydrocarbon recovery is optimized and enhanced recovery
scheme requirements are met, including Directive 051 wellbore integrity and completion
requirements. In addition to the requirements specified in AER Directives, site-specific operational
parameters, monitoring requirements, and annual reporting requirements may be identified and
specified in approvals177. The Alberta Regulatory Framework Assessment concluded in 2014 noted,
however, that improvements to the regulatory framework should clearly define how projects will be
classified as CCS or CO2-EOR as these activities are currently regulated by three different
regulatory frameworks. The same applies to the process for CO2-EOR projects to become CCS
projects. EOR has been classified as a Class II activity in the US. In December 2013, the USEPA
released draft guidance on transitioning Class II wells for oil and gas operations, including EOR, to
Class VI wells for geologic carbon storage. According to the draft, owners or operators of Class II
wells that inject CO2 for the primary purpose of long-term storage would be required to apply for,
and obtain, Class VI well permits if the UIC program director determines there is increased risk to
underground sources of drinking water. If a determination is made that a Class VI permit is needed,
a number of requirements must be fulfilled, both at the time of re-permitting and during future
operations, including: well construction and operation, geologic storage site testing and monitoring,
post-injection site care, and emergency and remedial response178. In Australia, petroleum licenses
issued in accordance with the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 confer,
inter alia, a conditional right to179 inject a substance into the seabed or subsoil of an offshore area,
store (whether on a permanent basis or otherwise) a substance in the seabed or subsoil of an
offshore area, or recover petroleum in the license area as a consequence of the injection of a
substance covered by the license. The Minister may also issue regulations that authorize petroleum
licenses to explore for potential greenhouse gas storage formations or greenhouse gas injection sites

within the relevant license area180. The OPGGS Act accommodates, where appropriate, CO2
transport and injection for EOR purposes, for example in relation to pipeline licensing181.

The ULC Legal Programme notes that Chinese oil and gas companies are experienced in enhanced
oil recovery and China has a well-established EOR regulation. However, amendments are
considered necessary in several areas including long-term liabilities, financial issues, injection site
locations, and injection criteria. The existing EOR legislation does not cover the management of
CO2 stored and the associated safety concerns182.

Of the countries regulating EOR activities in their territory, only the US has thus far prepared
specific guidance documents, though in a draft format, to facilitate the transition from an EOR
operation to a permanent storage site.

2.3.29 Planning requirements, such as Strategic Environmental Assessments

In order to ensure their successful implementation, an envisaged CCUS project should be in line
with existing plans and program applicable to the type of activity and the project site. For instance,
zoning or spatial plans should allow for CCUS activities, in particular for the injection of CO2, or
should not contain obstacles to the deployment of such activities. Prior to the development of a
CCUS project, it should be checked whether changes to plans are required. In several jurisdictions,
any such plans or program, or amendments to these plans or program, are subject to environmental
impact assessments. Such a strategic environmental assessment is considered more appropriate for
assessing the cumulative environmental impacts of several activities. While a project-based
environmental impact assessment aims at identifying likely environmental impacts of a proposed
activity or project and possible mitigation measures for such impacts, the strategic environmental
assessments considers whether the activities in a given area are compatible with environmental
objectives and assesses the cumulative environmental effects of several activities in one area. Often,
an SEA provides a broader framework for later EIA decisions.

The EU distinguishes between project-based environmental impact assessments (EIA) and the
impact assessments of plans and program, called Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA). The
SEA Directive applies to a wide range of public plans and program (e.g. on land use, transport,
energy, waste, agriculture)183. An SEA is mandatory for plans/programs which set the framework
for future development consent of projects listed in the EIA Directive. All CCS activities (including
capture, transport and storage) require a strategic environmental assessment having been carried out
during the planning phase. In the assessment, the likely significant effects on the environment and
the reasonable alternatives of the proposed plan or program must be identified, taking into account
the objectives and the geographical scope of the plan or program. The detailed requirements
concerning the content of the environmental assessment are described in Annex I to the SEA
Directive. The public, as well as the environmental authorities, must be informed and consulted on
the draft plan or program and the environmental report prepared. This also applies to neighboring
countries where the plans are likely to have significant effects in their territory. The Regional
Strategic Environmental Assessment in Canada does not explicitly mention CCUS projects.
However, the SEA procedure in Canada is designed in a similar manner to that in the EU. The
Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals is a

guidance document presenting the expectations of ministers and Cabinet on when an SEA should be
conducted and what it should consider184. Policy, plan and program proposals of departments and
agencies are required to consider, when appropriate, potential environmental effects, in particular
when the implementation of the proposal may result in important environmental effects, either
positive or negative185. It is therefore considered highly likely that any CCUS project would be
subject to an SEA in Canada. In the US, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires
federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of plans, legislation and regulatory proposals
and projects186. NEPA does not list the types of plans and programs subject to an SEA, but provides
more general wording covering both legislation and any major Federal actions significantly
affecting the human environment. Unlike the EU, NEPA does not distinguish between EIA and
SEA. It is unclear whether the strategic environment assessment in Australia would apply to CCUS
projects.

It can overall be concluded that it is very likely that an SEA will be required for the plans and
programs that provide the framework for later development consent for CCUS activities in all
countries investigated in-depth. In the EU, this is explicitly the case as an SEA is mandatory for
plans or programs which set the framework for later development consent for projects listed in the
EIA Directive.

2.3.30 Environmental impact assessment

Environmental impact assessments are standard practices for major infrastructure projects in many
jurisdictions around the world187. An EIA should identify and provide options for minimizing local
and regional environmental impacts related to the capture, transportation and storage of CO2, for
example, related with air emissions, use of water and solid waste generation188. The IEA Model
Regulatory framework notes that the sub-surface elements of CO2 projects may present new issues
in relation to EIA practice as it should enable an understanding of potential risks that CCUS
operations could pose to the surrounding environment, building on the site characterization work
carried out during the exploration phase of a CCUS project. An EIA should follow a risk-based
approach, including worse-case scenarios, as well as a consequence analysis enabling an
understanding of the impact of CO2 leakage or unintended migration on potential receptors. An EIA
is moreover an important tool for increasing public acceptance of a CCUS project through its public
participation requirements. Best practice procedures for undertaking EIAs for CO 2 storage sites are
being developed, for instance in the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Program189. Also in some of the
jurisdictions investigated as part of this report, EIA´s have been carried out for CO2 storage projects
which could provide useful insights into necessary requirements.

In the EU, environmental impact assessment requirements are specified in the EIA Directive. An
EIA is required to be concluded before consent (permit) for a project is given. An EIA is explicitly
required for the following CCS projects before a permit is granted:
     pipelines with a diameter of more than 800mm and length of more than 40km for
        transportation of CO2, including associated booster stations
     installations for capture of CO2 for the purposes of geological storage from installations

          assessment is always obligatory)
         where the total yearly capture of CO2 is 1.5 megatons or more
         CO2 storage sites

Other pipelines for the transport of CO2 streams (with a diameter of less than 800mm and length of
less than 40km) as well as other installations for the capture of CO 2 streams are subject to a
screening procedure – this means that for these installations environmental impact assessment is
not obligatory and Member States may decide whether to make them subject to environmental
impact assessment or not. The European Commission has prepared a set of guidance documents to
support Member States, as well as individual developers, in the practical application of the
Directive190. The Directive also includes requirements to consult with neighboring Member States
and for public consultation. In Canada, CCUS projects are not specifically listed in the regulation
as requiring EIAs. This is highlighted as a major regulatory gap in the Alberta Province Regulatory
Framework Assessment which concluded in 2014191. An assessment may only be triggered through
a review of the project on a discretionary basis. An EIA provides the regulator with the data in order
to make an informed decision that is in the public interest192. Under the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act (CEAA 2012), an environmental assessment focuses on potential adverse
environmental effects that are within federal jurisdiction, including: fish and fish habitat; other
aquatic species; migratory birds; federal lands; effects that cross provincial or international
boundaries; effects that impact on Aboriginal peoples, such as their use of lands and resources for
traditional purposes; changes to the environment that are directly linked to, or necessarily incidental
to, any federal decisions about a project. An environmental assessment will consider a
comprehensive set of factors that include cumulative effects, mitigation measures and comments
received from the public193. The responsibility for conducting an environmental assessment rests
with the National Energy Board for international and interprovincial pipelines and transmission
lines and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency for all other designated projects 194.
CEAA 2012 provides opportunities for public participation throughout the environmental
assessment process. Cooperation and communication with Aboriginal peoples with respect to
environmental assessment is a key component of CEAA 2012195. In the US, NEPA requires
agencies to prepare EIS for proposals for legislation and major Federal actions significantly
affecting the human environment196. This covers any project authorizations, legislative or regulatory
proposals or any other federal actions. In order to decide whether an EIA shall be carried out, a
screening procedure is expected. In the United States, the EIA is prepared by an agency of the
federal government. An EIS shall cover several environmental impacts and is required to propose
mitigation measures. The US also foresees public participation in the EIS procedure. The
Australian EPBC Act provides an integrated environmental assessment and approval process for
developments of “national environmental significance.”. Any such approval would involve an
environmental impact assessment. This is not explicitly dealt with in the Australian Government ’s
GGS Act but could apply to permitted activities under that Act. It is currently under consideration
that a “greenhouse trigger” be integrated into the EPBC regime. If enacted, this would add

greenhouse gas emissions to the list of matters of national environmental significance matters197. In
Victoria, the Environmental Effects Act 1978 (VEE Act) governs the preparation of environmental
impact assessments, or “Environmental Effects Statements” (EES). Under the Act, the Minister for
Planning has discretion to determine whether an EES is required in respect of, relevantly, public
works, any Ministerial decision or action, or any decision by a person or body under Victorian law.
If the Planning Minister determines that an EES is required, the responsibility for preparing it lies
with the project proponent. Once an EES is prepared, it is publicly displayed and no work can
proceed on the development until the Minister has assessed the EES.

In view of the above, the EIA regime in the US is the broadest regime as it covers SEA and EIA
requirements simultaneously as part of the same legal framework. Differently from the EU, in the
US, it is a federal agency itself that prepares the EIS, while in the EU, the project developer is
required to present an EIA report to the competent authorities for approval as part of the permitting
procedure. Canada does not require an EIA to be performed for CCUS projects unless this would be
decided on an ad-hoc basis. This is highlighted as a major regulatory gap in the Alberta Province´s
Regulatory Framework Assessment concluded in 2014.

2.3.31 Pollution prevention requirements

The environmentally sound implementation of CCUS projects is of major importance for the public
acceptance of CCS. Ensuring a high level of environmental protection from the risks posed by
storage should be one of the main purposes of regulatory frameworks for CCUS. As a consequence
of the authorization process for CCS activities and following the classification of CO 2, existing
pollution prevention requirements might apply to the individual phases of a CCUS project. For
instance, the classification of CO2 as a pollutant is likely to entail the application of industrial
emissions’ legislation in the capture phase or groundwater legislation in relation to storage.
Pollution prevention requirements can be specified in sectoral legislation applicable to sectors or
types of activities or in the permit conditions tailored to the specific circumstances of the site.

In the EU, legislation on the protection of groundwater is particularly relevant. The Water
Framework Directive (WFD) allows for the injection of CO2 into saline aquifers for storage
purposes and any such injection is subject to the provisions on the protection of groundwater. The
WFD requires Member States to take measures to prevent and limit the input of pollutants into
groundwater and prevent deterioration of the status of all bodies of groundwater. With regard to the
protection of marine waters, the provisions of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are
applicable. For the protection of ambient air, the application for a storage permit must include a
description of measures to prevent risks of leakages, as well as a proposed corrective measures plan.
The IED, which is applicable to the capture of CO2, requires that the application for the activity
must include an identification of significant effects of the emissions on the environment and
proposed technology for reducing the emissions as well as measures planned to monitor emissions
into the environment and the main alternatives to the proposed technology. A permit for CO2
capture must include all necessary measures to ensure that all the appropriate preventive measures
are taken against pollution, that no significant pollution is caused and that the necessary measures
are taken to prevent accidents and limit their consequences. In addition, the EIA requires that the
environmental report prepared by the developer must include measures envisaged in order to avoid,
reduce and, if possible, remedy significant adverse effects on the environment. In Canada,
environmental pollution as a consequence of CCUS is regulated by the Environmental Protection

and Enhancement Act (EPEA) which prohibits the release of a substance in an amount that may
cause a significant adverse effect, especially in matters of air contaminants, hazardous waste
chemicals, ozone depleting substances, and water contaminants. The National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) in the US establishes permit requirements for certain discharges from
industrial sources, including storm water runoff from an industrial facility or construction site and
wastewater discharges to municipal sewer systems. It was said to be likely that NPDES permits
covering existing facilities would have to be amended to account for the impact of a CCUS retrofit
on a facility’s effluent discharges (USDOE, 2007). In Australia, the GGGS Act makes provision in
relation to that matter by, or under, the Dangerous Goods Act 1985, the Environment Protection Act
1970, the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 or the Water Act 1989: the provision made by
the GGGS Act198: (a) if not inconsistent with that other provision, must be observed in addition to
that other provision; and (b) if inconsistent with that other provision, is, to the extent of the
inconsistency, of no force or effect and that other provision prevails.

EU legislation on pollution prevention is significantly more developed than that of other
jurisdictions as a consequence of the implementation of the precautionary principle in that region.
Also the distinction between common and civil law systems, and the use of class actions in the US,
influences the extent of detail in the development of regulatory requirements with a view to
preventing pollution. Specific pollution risks of the individual CCUS activities should be covered
by a regulatory framework, including the potential for leakage, migration, accidents or water
contamination. These can be addressed through several aspects of the regulatory framework, such
as monitoring requirements, remediation measures and thorough characterization studies of the site,
as well as through some of the pollution prevention requirements mentioned above.


2.3.32 Nature legislation requirements, including the consideration of protected habitats
       and species

Nature legislation might establish important restrictions on the implementation of CCUS projects,
including bans on large infrastructure projects in areas which could significantly affect protected
habitats or species. Nature legislation is, in many jurisdictions, an essential tool for the protection of
biodiversity and a wide range of requirements could be relevant for the consideration of CCUS
projects. Nature protection and the protection of natural habitats and species is also considered as an
important element of EIA reports for large infrastructure projects.

In the EU, the Habitats Directive199 forms the cornerstone of the EU’s nature conservation policy.
According to this Directive, each Member State must designate on its territory special areas of
conversation which cover natural habitat types listed in Annex I to the Directive and habitats of the
species listed in Annex II to the Directive. They also include species of wild birds covered by the
Birds Directive. All plans and projects not directly connected to the management of the protected
site, but likely to have significant effect on the site (thus including CCS activities), must be subject
to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site. Based on the results of such assessment,
the competent national authority can agree to the plan or project only after having verified that it
will not negatively affect the integrity of the site concerned and, if appropriate, after having
consulted the public. When CCS projects are subject to a screening procedure under the EIA
Directive and a Member State has to determine whether an environmental impact assessment is
required for these activities, they must also consider whether the project affects areas protected
under the Habitats and Birds Directives. There is no specific mention of protected habitats and

species in relation to CCUS projects specifically in Canada. A CCUS project would have specific
authorizations on a case-by-case basis in accordance with Alberta Wild Species (AWS). Also in the
US, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) enjoins the Federal government from taking any action that
could jeopardize a listed endangered or threatened species in the US, or destroy or adversely modify
critical habitat for such species (16 USC 1531). In order to trigger the requirements of the ESA, a
CO2 pipeline, for example, would first have to impact a protected species or habitat. Secondly, there
would have to be enough Federal involvement with the project, either through permitting or
funding, to identify the project as a Federal action. If the ESA did apply, the permitting or funding
agency would be required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National
Marine Fisheries, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On the
basis of this consultation, the consulting agencies would prepare a biological opinion to determine
whether the project would jeopardize protected species or habitat. If so, the action could be
prohibited under the ESA200. Finally, in Australia, Victoria has important areas with marine
mammal populations where these gather, breed and feed. Marine mammals are given special
protection under law in these areas to minimize disturbance and allow them the necessary space.
The 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act moreover contains specific requirements to
protect and manage threatened, migratory and marine species.

In all jurisdictions, it is thus expected that nature protection legislation will have to be respected in
the implementation of CCUS projects with a view to ensuring that the activities do not cause major
damage to biodiversity. It is important to note that nature protection legislation does not aim at
balancing economic interests with nature protection, but serves the protection of endangered species
as an overriding general public interest in specific protected areas. This explains the strict
conditions that shall be respected in this context.

2.3.33 Waste legislation requirements

The IEA Model Regulatory Framework notes that regulatory issues associated with CO2 capture
and transport are generally likely to fall within the scope of existing regulatory frameworks related
to waste, with little or no modification to those existing frameworks. This would include the
generation of waste during post-combustion capture as these would be subject to industrial waste
requirements. This is different in the EU where CCS has been explicitly excluded from existing
waste requirements to avoid the application of the burdensome requirements, for instance, for the
transportation of waste in the EU, to CCS activities. Other countries, however, allow for the
classification of CO2 as a waste, thus ensuring the application of existing waste requirements to
CCUS.

2.3.34 Coastal and marine protection requirements

The 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes
and Other Matter 1972 (London Protocol) prohibits the dumping of controlled materials into the
sea. The London Protocol was amended in 2006 to make clear that CO2 could be stored in the sea
bed and in 2009 to enable the transboundary transportation of CO2 for storage. The amendment
enabling transboundary transportation has not yet entered into force. With a view to implementing
these requirements, but also as part of a national policy for the protection of the coastal and marine
environment, several countries have adopted specific legislation establishing specific limitations
and authorizations aiming to contribute to the protection of the marine environment. It is expected
that such requirements would be applicable to any CCUS activities taking place at sea.

                                                                                                      75
The protection of coast and marine waters in the EU is regulated by the Marine Strategy Framework
Directive (MSFD)201. The MSFD is the most ambitious of current marine environment protection
legislation. It is based on the ecosystem-based approach which focuses on the relationship between
human society and marine ecosystems in order to achieve and maintain good environmental status
of marine waters, enable the sustainable use of the sea and inform relevant management decisions.
No provisions related directly to CCS activities are contained in the MSFD. However, its general
requirements would be applicable to CO2 offshore transportation networks and CO2 storage sites. In
Australia, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act of 1981 implements the requirements of
the London Convention in Australia. The 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act
moreover contains specific requirements to protect and manage threatened, migratory and marine
species. This legislation does not specifically refer to CCS activities, though such activities offshore
would be covered by the legislation. In the US, injection wells up to three miles offshore could
become subject to regulation under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act
(MPRSA). The USEPA submitted to Congress proposed changes to MPRSA to implement the 1996
Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter (London Protocol). Among the proposed changes is a provision to allow for and regulate
CO2 sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations under the MPRSA. Finally, in Canada, a
CCS project would require specific authorizations on a case by case basis in accordance with the
Canada Marine Act.

While none of the regulatory frameworks for the protection of the marine environment explicitly
refer to CCUS activities beyond the explicit requirements of the London Protocol, it is expected that
some of the above requirements would impact CCUS activities offshore, e.g. specific authorizations
and monitoring requirements. The IEA Framework recommends explicitly transposing the
requirements of the London Protocol applicable to CCS in the national legal order with a view to
ensuring legal certainty.

2.3.35 Coverage by greenhouse gas trading schemes

In the context of setting up a regulatory framework for CCUS, emissions’ accounting requirements
(e.g. monitoring, reporting and verification) under emissions trading programs, shall be an area of
consideration when analyzing current regulations and industry operations to assess whether they are
ready to apply or whether they need to be modified. In relation to liability for global effects, the
IEA Model notes that incentive schemes for CCUS are likely to create performance-based payments
linked to the amount of CO2 avoided through a project. In the event of leakage, payments should be
adjusted accordingly. This can occur through different mechanisms, such as cap-and-trade based
emissions, trading schemes or project based emissions trading schemes. Cap-and-trade based
emission trading is mentioned as an incentive that can be used to promote CCUS deployment at
large emitting point source installations. The Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS are provided as
examples.

In the EU, the ETS Directive establishes the EU emission trading system and is a key tool for
reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. The system works on a ‘cap and trade’ basis.
According to the ETS Directive, an obligation to surrender allowances does not arise in respect of
emissions of CO2 verified as captured and transported for permanent storage to a facility for which
a permit is in force. However, in case of any leaks from the storage site, the operator of the site
must surrender the relevant amount of carbon emission allowances.


201
   Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for
community action in the field of marine environmental policy.

                                                                                                               76
Both, CO2 capture and storage are covered by the ETS scheme. It means that operators of industrial
plants (that have capture installations), as well as operators of CO2 storage sites, are entitled to
separate allowances under the ETS scheme. However, it has to be borne in mind that storage sites
are only covered by the ETS scheme insofar as a leakage from the storage site occurs (e.g. recital 30
of CCS Directive). In addition, under Article 4 of the ETS Directive, no installation shall carry out
any activity listed in Annex I (including also CO2 storage) resulting in emissions specified in
relation to that activity unless its operator holds a greenhouse gas emission permit. The storage of
CO2 does not result in emissions as such, and therefore it is unclear how the Member State would
ensure that they have emission permits or allowances. On the above basis, we understand that the
operator of a storage site, which only emits in the case of leakage, will only be entitled to
allowances (through auctioning) if there is such leakage. Under Article 10a of the ETS ‘… no free
allocation shall be given to electricity generators, to installations for the capture of CO 2 , to
pipelines for transport of CO2 or to CO2 storage sites’. Under Article 12 of the ETS Directive ‘3a.
An obligation to surrender allowances shall not arise in respect of emissions verified as captured
and transported for permanent storage to a facility for which a permit is in force in accordance with
Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the
geological storage of carbon dioxide’. This means that only the operator of a plant emitting CO 2
captured and transported to the storage site can request the credits for not-surrendered allowances
(i.e. the metric tons of CO2 that are not emitted by an industrial plant as a consequence of CCS).

In the US there is no federal-level mechanism imposing a cost on GHG emissions. Instead, there are
mandatory and voluntary cap-and-trade programs. Examples of mandatory programs are the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is integrated by the north-eastern states, and
Western Climate Initiative. Meanwhile, Chicago Climate Exchange, and American Carbon Registry
are examples of voluntary programs. Numerous US States have implemented their own mandatory
GHG reporting rules. Many States are requiring GHG reporting from all facilities that hold permits
for air emissions under Title V of the CAA. There is no explicit mention of CCUS activities in this
context though it is expected that CO2 captured would be considered as not emitted. The American
Carbon Registry (ACR), a non-profit enterprise of Winrock International, has approved one of the
voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Methodologies for CCS Projects for the
measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emission reductions
associated with capture and storage of CO2 in geologic formations202. ACR recognizes that there are
multiple options possible for geological storage. However, this methodology only applies to
enhanced oil and gas recovery projects, in which CO2 is injected to enhance production from
hydrocarbon-producing reservoirs or currently non-producing reservoirs203. Under ACR Standard,
projects are only eligible if there is clear and uncontested ownership of the pore space and, unless
the Project Proponent has filed a Risk Mitigation Covenant and secured the consent of surface
owners to the filing of a Risk Mitigation Covenant or provided an alternative risk mitigation
assurance acceptable to ACR, offset credits issued for a project shall be subject to invalidation 204.
Both Project Proponent and EOR operators can obtain the credits.

The California cap-and-trade program came into effect in 2013 and applies to large electric power
plants, large industrial plants and, since 2015, to fuel distributors. The Air Resources Board, who
manages the Californian cap-and-trade program, is currently developing a quantification

methodology for CCS. The CCS quantification methodology is expected to possibly be adopted for
use in the Cap-and-Trade and Low Carbon Fuel Standard programs. Preparatory meetings on the
accounting protocols as well as technical discussions have taken place in the course of 2016.205

In Canada there is no federal–level GHG emission trading mechanism. On 14 April 2015 a pan-
Canadian Summit on climate change was held in Québec with the objective to foster dialogue
among provinces and territories about climate and energy challenges and solutions, including
carbon pricing206. Alberta’s offset credit (Alberta-Based Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program and
Offset Credit System) system is a compliance mechanism for entities regulated under the province’s
mandatory GHG emission intensity-based regulatory system. The tradable units in the Alberta
offset system are referred to as ‘Alberta-based offset credits’ or Verified Emissions Reductions or
Removals (VERRs) and are measured in units of metric tons of CO2e207. Alberta´s Offset Credit
System requires that projects are real, demonstrable and quantifiable, and are not required by law.
Issues concerning additionality are addressed during the multi-stakeholder technical review process
and during the public posting period. Project developers must demonstrate that the project activity
results in emissions’ reductions that are beyond business as usual practices. No further additionality
screening tests are required208. The Australian Government developed a national carbon offset
standard, due to be introduced in Australia in 2010. The purpose of the standard would have been to
regulate emission reductions occurring outside the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) by
ensuring minimum standards and establishing verification and validation protocols. However, the
legislation for the CPRS failed to gain adequate support and was rejected twice. Finally, Japan is
considering developing a methodology under the Joint Credit Mechanism with Mexico, including a
methodology for CCS/EOR.

2.3.36 Protecting human health

The risks presented to human populations located in the vicinity of CO2 capture, transport and
storage facilities might, according to the IEA Model, be captured by extending the application of
any existing laws on civil protection and industrial facilities to cover CCUS operations209. Also,
specific risk assessment procedures for CO2 storage sites linked to site selection and
characterization should assist in mitigating risks to human populations. It is important to carefully
assess the application of existing legal requirements aiming to protect human health and assess
whether these sufficiently comprehend the risks associated with CCUS projects, in combination
with the specific requirements established for such projects.

The requirements concerning the protection of human health are scattered around the relevant
pieces of EU legislation, in particular the CCS Directive, the EIA Directive, the IED, as well as the
occupational health and safety legislation. The CCS Directive states that CO2 must be stored in such
a way as to eliminate negative effects and risks to the environment and human health. Operational
provisions of the Directive contain more specific requirements concerning human health protection.
For example, the composition of the CO2 stream cannot pose a significant risk to the environment
and human health and monitoring and inspections of CO2 storage sites must be carried out with the
purpose of detecting adverse effects on human health. In case of leakages from a storage site, the

operator must take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of human health. According to
the IED (which applies to capture installations), in case a breach of a permit causes an immediate
danger to human health, the operation of the installation must be suspended. Inspections of
installations must take into account potential and actual impacts of the installation on human health.
In Canada, AER Directive 071 outlines the requirements for a corporate-level emergency response
plan (ERP) and stipulates that these plans must have pre-planned procedures that will aid an
effective response to an emergency. An ERP for a CCUS project does not currently require
approval from the regulator. However, the regulator may review the ERP upon request. An
emergency planning zone (EPZ) is a geographical area surrounding a well, pipeline or facility
containing a hazardous product that requires specific emergency response planning by the licensee.
The licensee is required to carry out notification and education for the public that lives within the
EPZ. There are no requirements for the submission of a risk assessment of CO2 sequestration
projects in Alberta legislation. However, the Mines and Minerals Act allows for the creation of
regulations that require applicants to conduct risk assessments before being granted an agreement
for CO2 sequestration. In the US, an owner or operator may always be subject to an order the
USEPA deems necessary to protect the health of persons under SDWA after site closure if there is
fluid migration that causes or threatens imminent and substantial endangerment to a USDW. For
example, the Administrator may issue an SDWA section 1431 order if a well may present an
imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, and the State and local authorities
have not acted to protect the health of such persons210. The order may include commencing a civil
action for appropriate relief. If the owner or operator fails to comply with the order, they may be
subject to a civil penalty for each day in which such a violation occurs or failure to comply
continues.

Requirements for the protection of public health are mostly captured by civil protection
requirements and in the specific regulatory framework established for CCUS projects in all
jurisdictions. It shall be noted that a sound risk assessment as part of the site characterization,
monitoring requirements and legal requirements in relation to remediation measures, are essential
tools for ensuring the protection of public health in the context of CCUS projects.

2.3.37 Protecting workers´ safety

CO2 capture, transport and storage should be operated in a manner that ensures workers are
protected from the effects of any CO2 releases211.

The EU has developed a very extensive and stringent occupational health and safety (OSH) legal
and policy framework. No specific OSH legislation related only to CCS activities exists, besides
Article 8 of the CCS Directive which merely requires that the storage permit can be issued only
when professional and technical development and training of the operator and all staff are provided.
The general OSH framework is, however, applicable to CCS activities and these OSH regulations
must be taken into account by operators when carrying out their activities. In Canada, CO2 could
be captured under the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation (OHSR) through the definition of
harmful substance. Also, the Controlled Product Regulations likely encompass CO2. Under the
Occupational Health and Safety Code 2009 (OHSC), “controlled product” and “harmful substance”
have the same meaning as in the OHSR. “Hazard” means a situation, condition or object that may
be dangerous to the safety or health of workers. “Hazardous waste” means a controlled product that
is intended for disposal, or is sold for pressure that is intended for disposal, would qualify as

hazardous waste for the purposes of Occupational Health and Safety. CO2 would likely qualify as
hazardous waste for this purpose. US legislation contains standards for CO2 exposure and handling.
Occupational hazards can be minimized when workers adhere to safety standards and use
appropriate protective equipment. Specific standards set out such safety requirements or exposure
limits. There are no specific requirements in Australia for protecting workers´ safety in CCUS
projects. Victoria has an Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 which contains general
occupational health and safety requirements.

2.3.38 Sharing knowledge and experience through the demonstration phase

The IEA Model Regulatory Framework notes that, in most countries, CCUS is entering a phase of
technological demonstration with a view to moving towards full-scale deployment. As such,
countries may wish to develop demonstration frameworks and overall demonstration strategies.
These can show the technical potential for CCUS deployment in a country, assess storage capacity
using international best practice methodologies to enable comparison of estimates, highlight which
technologies are most promising and which ones are suited to the circumstances of the country in
question, provide incentives and financing as well as build public understanding and confidence in
CCS. While CCUS is predominantly in a demonstration phase, it is useful to pool experiences in
order to facilitate the dissemination of lessons learnt (dissemination of good practice). Several
forums are emerging that are designed to share good practice examples including the IEA, the IEA
International CCS Regulatory Network, the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Program, The Global
Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI), the European Technology Platform for Zero
Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP). Emerging technology transfer processes and technology
mechanisms under discussion at an international level through the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, should also be actively monitored as a means to leverage support
for national level actions linked to CCUS212. In some cases, concerns over IPR may hamper such
information-sharing. The use of knowledge-sharing provisions linked to financial support for
technology development and demonstration can help to overcome such barriers213.

The EU has established an important mechanism to enable knowledge-sharing and finance
demonstration projects across the EU Member States. The ETS Directive provides that 300 million
emission allowances under the ETS from the New Entrants Reserve shall be made available to help
stimulate the construction and operation of up to eight commercial demonstration projects aimed at
the environmentally safe storage of CO2 in the EU and for the implementation of renewable energy
demonstration projects. The so-called NER-300 program also aims at leveraging complementary
investments from the private sector and from national governments214. Also, A CCS network has
been established by the European Commission to accelerate the development of safe, large-scale
and commercially viable CCS projects215. In Canada, the requirements of the four funded projects
in Alberta serve as the main driver behind knowledge-sharing mechanisms. The Government of
Alberta holds the position that a consistent approach is needed to be able to use the resulting
knowledge, which means that data from various projects with similar technology blocks must be
comparable216. This requires standardized templates and measures for the large number of key

openness that might be challenging to some groups. Agreement may be needed to address
intellectual property issues. A common web-based technology platform should enable global access
and utilization of the collected data. Its design should be driven by the needs of the global CCUS
community218. There is, however, no similar knowledge-sharing scheme to the EU NER 300. The
US has significant knowledge-sharing initiatives through the National Energy Technology
Laboratory (NETL), which is an agency of the USDOE. NETL focuses on the energy portfolio,
including CCS. Information is shared through its corporate site (www.netl.doe.gov) as well as a
collaboration and data-sharing site it maintains at: http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page219. The US
and Canada recently formalized knowledge-sharing arrangements as summarized in the United
States-Canada Clean Energy Dialogue. This includes the Carbon Capture and Storage Clean Energy
Technology Working Group, collaborating on areas such as a storage atlas, next-generation
technology, injection and storage-testing and public outreach strategies. Knowledge sharing is also
provided through the USDOE’s Clean Coal Technology and Clean Coal Power Initiative220. Finally,
the Australian Government Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has detailed
knowledge-sharing arrangements for projects as part of the initial funding for the pre-feasibility
studies. The Global CCS Institute knowledge-sharing framework has been used as the basis for this
work, although not all of the possible knowledge categories were used. To date, supported projects
have agreed to contribute to project factsheets, knowledge-sharing reports as well as providing
knowledge-sharing personnel. The projects are receptive to knowledge sharing, but within the
boundaries of protection of specified intellectual property221. The Victorian Government has
contributed over A$29million (US$2.5) to the Centre for Energy and Greenhouse Gas Technologies
(CEGT) (Victorian DPI, 2009a). CEGT identifies new technologies that require investment to reach
the demonstration or commercialization stage. The Centre, in conjunction with co-investors, aims to
generate venture capital grade returns on its investments by meeting the growing Australian and
global demand for these technologies222.

3     REVIEW OF THE MEXICAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CCUS
      ACTIVITIES


A second step in our assessment consisted of analyzing the current state of the regulatory
framework in Mexico in the context of CCUS. While Mexico does not have a specific regulatory
framework for CCUS projects at this time, relevant legislation can be identified for any such
activities, either because the provisions would apply implicitly to such activities or they could easily
be made applicable following amendments. For this analysis, the same list of key issues used for the
review of international best regulatory practices and models was applied. This will allow us not
only to identify relevant legislation, but also potential gaps in the regulatory framework for those
areas where no legislation exists. The assessment provided in this chapter lays the basis for the gap
and barrier analysis which will be prepared as a next step under this study.

3.1     INTRODUCTION TO THE MEXICAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CCUS


3.1.1    Introduction to the Mexican legal system and the legal basis for the regulation of
         CCUS in Mexico

Mexico, of which the official name is Estados Unidos Mexicanos (Mexico) is a Federation
comprised of 31 states and a Federal District. Each of those states is divided into municipalities or
delegaciones as they are known in the Federal District. According to this political structure and the
Mexican Federal Constitution, Mexico has three government levels including, the Federal
Government, State Governments, and Municipalities. All three levels of the Mexican political
structure are reflected in Mexico’s legislative branch, executive branch and, to a lesser degree, its
judicial branch.

At federal level, the legislative branch is composed of the Senate of the Republic, with 128
Senators, and the Chamber of Deputies, made up of 500 Deputies. Any federal law or act must be
discussed and approved by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies; Thus, these two entities are
commonly referred to as the Congress of the Union (Congreso de la Unión) which is the official
name of the entity entitled to sign into law any amendment or new regulation previously approved
by both chambers. This same federal legislative structure also exists at state level, with minor
differences in every state and reduced attributions to legislate, taking into account that the most
important aspects regarding natural resources and environment, which are of the upmost importance
for CCUS projects, are attributed to the Federation, as stated in the Federal Constitution , and further
regulated in the federal LGEEPA.

The distribution of competences in relation to environmental protection in Mexico is not entirely
clear. However, in our opinion, several legal bases can be identified for the regulation of CCS
projects at the federal level.

First, the General Law on Climate Change foresees the regulation of atmospheric emissions of
gases and greenhouse compounds in sections II and III of its article 2. This Law foresees the
promotion of technologies and the reduction of CO2 from the atmosphere. It is therefore reasonable
to foresee that CCUS secondary regulation (i.e. reglamento) would be derived from this General




                                                                                                     83
Law on Climate Change223. This is considered an appropriate legal basis, moreover similar to that
used in other jurisdictions.

In addition, CCUS projects are closely related to energy projects and the storage of hazardous
materials or waste, in view of the similar or shared properties of the activities. Both activities are
regulated in federal legislation. Energy generation (taking into account that CCUS projects and its
technologies can be linked to co-generation facilities and depleted oil and gas reservoirs) as well as
hydrocarbons, mining and electricity are some of the topics which can only be regulated by the
Congress of Union (i.e. competence of the Federal government) as stated in Article 73, fraction X,
of the Federal Constitution. In the same way, the General Law for the Prevention and Integral
Management of Wastes is likely to be the applicable law for the storage of hazardous materials and
wastes. Also here, this is similar to the distribution of competences and regulation in other
jurisdictions. In many of the other jurisdictions reviewed in this study, several storage components
of CCUS activities are regulated similarly to or based on hydrocarbons and waste legislation. In
some countries, this legislation is federal, in others it is state-based. However, the legal basis in
most jurisdictions, apart from the EU where a separate legal instrument was developed, is set in
hydrocarbons and waste legislation.

The executive branch at the federal level is constituted by the President, who is in charge of
nominating the members of his or her cabinet. The cabinet includes 19 ministries, which include the
following: Ministry of the Interior (Secretaría de Gobernación); Ministry of Foreign Relations
(Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores); Ministry of National Defense (Secretaría de la Defensa
Nacional); Ministry of the Navy (Secretaría de Marina); Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
(Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público); Ministry of Social Development (Secretaría de
Desarrollo Social); Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría de Medio
Ambiente y Recursos Naturales); Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía); Ministry of Economy
(Secretaría de Economía); Ministry of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública);
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food (Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería,
Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación); Ministry of Transport and Communications (Secretaría
de Comunicaciones y Transportes); Ministry of Public Service (Secretaría de la Función Pública);
Ministry of Health (Secretaría de Salud); Ministry of Labor and Social Security (Secretaría del
Trabajo y Previsión Social); Ministry of Agriculture, Rural and Urban Development (Secretaría de
Desarrollo Agrario, Territorial y Urbano); Ministry of Tourism (Secretaría de Turismo); Legal
Counsel of the Federal Executive (Consejería Jurídica del Ejecutivo Federal; and the Attorney
General’s Office (Procuraduría General de la República).

The judiciary includes primarily the Federation Judiciary Power, as well as other judicial bodies
that are organs either autonomous from the executive (i.e. Court of Administrative Justice) or
closely related to it (as the Supreme Agrarian Tribunal). However, the Supreme Court of Justice of
the Nation is regarded as the most important Mexican tribunal because it decides the most important
cases regarding constitutional law, civil law, criminal law and labor law, among others.

According to the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice, sources of law in Mexico are legislation,
jurisprudence, customs, individualized provisions, and general principles of law224. In the same way,
the Mexican Federal Constitution in its Article 133 establishes that the Constitution, laws issued by
the Congress of the Union and international treaties are the main sources of law.


223
    In aaddition to the actual legal provisions exposed in this page regarding the competence of the Federal Government to
regulate CCUS projects,there are also practical reasons to promote the creation of a legal framework in the federal level in
order to avoid the creation of different regulation among different States.
224
    See https://www.scjn.gob.mx/conocelacorte/documents/publicaciones/Sistema-Juridico-Mexicano.pdf, page 10.

                                                                                                                         84
For the purpose of addressing CCUS projects, the following sources of law should be considered:
     Federal Constitution and States’ Constitutions;
     General Acts and Laws issued by the Federal Congress, Federal Acts and Laws issued by
        the Federal Congress or the States’ Congress;
     Regulations issued by Municipalities.

The Mexican legal system is a civil law system, which means that case law is secondary and
subordinated to statutory law.

The different levels of the Mexican executive branch, according to the legal framework specified in
the previous paragraph, are entitled to issue several regulations to specify and develop the
provisions established in the Constitutional and Secondary Laws. For example, the Mexican
Official Standards (or “NOMs”, from the Spanish Normas Oficiales Mexicanas) are issued by
several Ministries and their objective is to regulate specific aspects of the Act where a legal basis
for such NOMs is provided in the Act, such as technical standards, security standards, measurement
processes and environmental prohibitions, among others. Mexican Official Standards are always
mandatory, in contrast to Mexican Standards (“NMX”, or Normas Mexicanas), which are not
considered mandatory standards.

3.1.2   The 2013 Mexican Energy Reform

In December 2013, a Constitutional Reform substantially modified the structure of the energy
industry in Mexico, as well as the environmental provisions related to the oil sector. Prior to this
reform, the primary activities of the energy sector were reserved to the Mexican State and exercised
through state-affiliated entities (i.e. PEMEX and CFE.), and the protection of the environment was
mainly attributed to SEMARNAT and its organisms PROFEPA and CONAGUA. On 30 April
2014, secondary legislation initiatives were presented to the Congress in order to enable the
implementation of the Constitutional Reform approved on 20 December 2013. During the months
following the presentation of the initiatives, the Mexican Congress signed into law different
legislative packages, opening the door for the Federal Executive to create several entities (such as
the Mexican Agency for Security, Energy and Environment, ASEA) and empower other entities
(such as CNH and CRE) to apply the enacted regulation. The Energy Reform provided for the
issuance and publication of the following nine new laws which were published in the Official
Gazette of the Federation on August 11, 2014: Coordinated Regulating Energy Sector Agencies Act
(Ley de Órganos Reguladores Coordinados en Materia Energética); Electric Industry Act (Ley de
la Industria Eléctrica); Federal Electricity Commission Act (Ley de la Comisión Federal de
Electricidad); Geothermal Energy Act (Ley de Energía Geotérmica); Hydrocarbons Act, (Ley de
Hidrocarburos); Hydrocarbon’s Revenues Act (Ley de Ingresos sobre Hidrocarburos); Mexican
Oil Fund for Stabilization and Development Act (Ley del Fondo Mexicano del Petróleo para la
Estabilización y el Desarrollo); National Agency for Industrial Security and Environmental
Protection of the Hydrocarbon Sector Act (Ley de la Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Industrial y de
Protección al Medio Ambiente del Sector Hidrocarburos “ASEA Act”); and Petróleos Mexicanos
Act (Ley de Petróleos Mexicanos). In addition to the new legislation, the following existing laws
were amended: Federal Duties Law (Ley Federal de Derechos); Federal Law on Budget and
Treasury Responsibility (Ley Federal de Presupuesto y Responsabilidad Hacendaria); Federal
Law of Parastatal Entities (Ley Federal de las Entidades Paraestatales); Foreign Investment Law
(Ley de Inversión Extranjera); General Law on Public Debt (Ley General de Deuda Pública); Law
on Procurement, Leasing and Services of the Public Sector, (Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos
y Servicios del Sector Público); Law of Public Works and Services (Ley de Obras Públicas y
Servicios relacionados con las Mismas); Mining Law (Ley Minera); National Waters Law (Ley de
Aguas Nacionales); Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration (Ley Orgánica de la

                                                                                                  85
Administración Pública Federal); Public-Private Association Law (Ley de Asociaciones Público
Privadas); and Tax Coordination Law (Ley de Coordinación Fiscal.).

On 31 October 2014, the Federal Executive published further energy regulations, as well as some
amendments to existing regulations, including guidelines providing the criteria for the granting of
Clean Energy. The package issued on October 31 includes the following: Regulations to the
Hydrocarbons Law (Reglamento de la Ley de Hidrocarburos); Regulations of the activities
comprising the Third Title of the Hydrocarbons Law (Reglamento de las actividades a que se
refiere el Título Tercero de la Ley de Hidrocarburos); Regulations to the Hydrocarbons Revenue
Law (Reglamento a la Ley de Ingresos sobre Hidrocarburos); Regulations to the the Petroleos
Mexicanos Law (Reglamento de la Ley de Petroleos Mexicanos); Regulations to the Power Industry
Law (Reglamento de la Ley de la Industria Eléctrica); Regulations to the Geothermal Energy Law
(Reglamento de la Ley de Energía Geotérmica); Regulations to the Federal Electricity Commission
Law (Reglamento de la Ley de la Comision Federal de Electricidad); Regulations to the Internal
Regulations of the National Agency of Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection of the
Hydrocarbons Sector (Reglamento Interior de la Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Industrial y de
Protección al Medio Ambiente del Sector Hidrocarburos).

The relevant instruments for CCUS activities are referred to in the following section, where
appropriate.

3.1.3   Legal framework for CCUS activities

The Mexican CCUS Roadmap published in 2014, highlights the potential steps for the
implementation of CCUS activities in Mexico. As part of its national climate change mitigation
strategy, Mexico has been exploring the potential for implementing CCUS activities in its territory.
The Roadmap in particular highlights the potential for CCS/EOR activities whereby the injection of
CO2 is used to increase hydrocarbon recovery in Mexico. Moreover, important steps have been
taken in the geological mapping of the Mexican storage potential through a range of studies. The
steps presented in the Mexican CCUS roadmap set out the policy framework for promoting the
deployment of CCUS activities in Mexico. It includes the need for the development of a regulatory
framework for such activities.

Mexico does not have a specific regulatory framework for CCS or CCUS activities at this point in
time. However, based on existing rules of the energy and environmental sector, some acts and
regulations provide guidelines for CCUS projects. Such acts and regulations consist mainly of
environmental requirements, land use regulations, and tax incentives that promote CCUS activities.
A detailed assessment of relevant existing legislation is included in the following chapter of this
study.

As stated above, Mexico is a federation consisting of three levels of government ( i.e. federal, state
and local). Only federal legislation covers CCUS activities to some extent, in particular through
environmental and energy legislation. Both the environmental and energy areas of law were
recently modified and expanded following the Mexican Energy reform, which took place at a
constitutional level in December 2013 followed by the Secondary Laws in August 2014.
Accordingly, some regulations and guidelines have been issued, covering certain aspects of CCUS
activities.

As a result of the Constitutional amendment and the secondary legislation, for the first time, general
regulatory requirements for CCUS activities have been introduced in the Mexican legal framework
for energy together with other legal requirements for clean energy. Energy regulation related to

                                                                                                   86
CCUS projects has been developed in general terms since the Hydrocarbons Law entered into force.
The Hydrocarbons Law foresees the injection of CO2 into depleting oil reservoirs to recover
additional oil beyond what would have been recovered by conventional drilling, referred to as
enhanced oil recovery.

Additionally, the Energy Reform established a National Agency for Industrial Security and
Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector (ASEA) as the authority entitled to inspect
and control activities in the hydrocarbons sector, including EOR through CCUS projects. On the
basis of Article 5°, section XIX of the ASEA Law, ASEA is expected to issue new guidelines and
rules on EOR in the following months225.

3.1.4      National Policy on Climate Change

Mexico´s National Policy on Climate Change is implemented through two main instruments,
namely the National Strategy on Climate Change (Estratégia Nacional de Cambio Climático) and
the Special Program on Climate Change (Programa Especial de Cambio Climático). The National
Strategy on Climate Change, elaborated by the Secretary of the Environment and Natural
Resources, lays down the national policy on climate change in both the medium and long term. This
instrument establishes the principles and action lines necessary to promote projects aiming to tackle
climate change in each one of the government levels.

The Special Program on Climate Change is developed on the basis of the National Strategy on
Climate Change. From the four objectives of this national policy instrument, objective number three
Critical Path for CCUS Projects, provides for the implementation of CCUS projects, including the
pilot project in relation to capture with CFE and the pilot project involving EOR with Pemex.

The goal to take measures on climate change mitigation in Mexico is also included as a national
objective in the National Development Plan (PND) Mexico Prospero, particularly in Objective 4.4,
Strategy 4.4.3. On this point, the PND seeks to strengthen national policy on climate change and
transition to a competitive, sustainable, resilient and low-carbon economy. In addition, it is based on
Articles 31 to 37 of the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) and strategic axes M1, M2 and
M3 of the National Climate Change Strategy (ENCC).

The General Law on Climate Change establishes the legal framework for climate change mitigation
in Mexico, including, among others, the establishment of the Mexican National Emissions
Inventory of GHG and associated reporting obligations. A more detailed assessment of these
requirements is introduced in the tables below.

CCUS activities are thus considered explicitly as a part of the Mexican climate change mitigation
strategy. In this framework, the Law on Electricity Industry is also particularly relevant as it
introduces the use of clean energy certificates for the production of clean energy, in which the
issuance of certificates for CO2 capture is considered.

In accordance with Article 3 of the Law on Electricity Industry clean energy is defined as follows:
“those energy sources and processes of generation whose emissions or waste, where they exist, do
not exceed the thresholds set out in the regulations that are issued to this effect.” The catalog of
clean energy according to this article in section XXII subsection m) provides that the energy
generated by power plants with processes of capture and geological storage or biosequestration of
CO2 shall be efficient, equal or superior in terms of kWh-generated per metric ton of carbon dioxide

225
      As confirmed by ASEA.

                                                                                                    87
equivalent emitted into the atmosphere, according to the minimum efficiency established by the
Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and emissions criteria established by SEMARNAT.

Seeking to promote investment in clean energy and in order to reach the national goal of electricity
generation, the Energy Ministry issued guidelines establishing criteria for granting energy
certificates and the requirements for their acquisition, in force since 1 January 2015. According to
the Electricity Industry Act: it is a security issued by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE)
that certifies the production of a certain amount of electricity from clean energy and serves to meet
the requirements related to the load centers.

These certificates are a tool to transform individual obligations into national goals of clean
electricity generation, effectively and at less cost to the country. The CEL (energy certificate) is as
such an important tool for achieving the annual target the government set for the production of
clean energy of 35% in the framework of Energy Reform.

The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) which grants certificates, issues the regulation to
validate the ownership of the CEL, verifies compliance with the requirements for certification and
is responsible for receiving the information of electricity generated in a month for each plant which
uses clean energy technologies, referred to in the legislation as Clean power Plants. The information
collected will be used by SENER to draw up a public report on the results of performance and
trends in the wholesale electricity market.

According to the Law on Electrical Industry, for the sale of CEL, the wholesale electricity market
which will be operated by the National Center for Energy Control (CENASE), responsible for
receiving and calculating energy prices, will also be competent in this area for clean energy. CEL
provides the right to receive, for a period of twenty years, Clean Generators, per megawatt-hour
generated in the Clean Power Plants, multiplied by the percentage of free energy fuel representing:

• The Clean Power Plants in operation after 11 August 2014
• The existing power plants that generate electricity from clean energy which entered into operation
before 11 August 2014 (provided they have completed a project to increase production of clean
energy, counting the 20 years from the increase of production).

The obligations that generators and distributors of electricity must meet will be determined by
several factors which the Secretary of Energy will consider key factors depending on each plant
such as:

• The time and cost of the transmission and distribution of energy
• The costs of generation technology
• The number of offers published in the Wholesale Electricity Market
• The volatility of the costs of fossil fuels in the long run
• In turn, the amount of MWh of clean energy generators should cover in each set period, subject to
the requirements of (CEL) for the mandatory period and the total energy consumed during the same
period the points made in the Guidelines establishing criteria for granting energy certificate and the
requirements for its acquisition became effective on 1 January 2015.

The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) are a mechanism in which countries
publicly outline what climate actions are intended to be taken after 2020. In the case of Mexico, the
INDC is composed of mitigation and adaptation strategies, which are subject to two main schemes
of reduction: Unconditional Reduction and Conditional Reduction. The Unconditional Reduction is
designed to reduce greenhouse gases by at least 25% by the year 2030, while the Conditional

                                                                                                    88
Reduction implies that the 25% initially stated can increase up to 40% subject to a global agreement
on climate change226. In both cases, CCS and CCUS projects should be in a manner which considers
reducing associated risks and costs in order to achieve such goals.

3.1.5     Regulation of CCUS activities

As mentioned above, very few specific legal requirements explicitly apply to CCUS activities in
Mexico due to the early stages of development of such activities in the country. The specific
regulation regarding CCUS activities is included in the new ASEA Act, as stated in section XIX of
Article 5, and in the revised Hydrocarbons Act. However, relevant environmental requirements can
also be found in the existing framework for infrastructure and energy projects, as stated in the
General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (“LGEEPA”). A detailed
assessment of potentially relevant requirements is included in the assessment tables analyzing
relevant requirements for the key issues related to the CCUS activities below.

Moreover, environmental regulations are closely linked with financial and tax benefits as stated in
the Income Tax Act and the Special Tax on Products and Services Act, as well as in the General
Law on Climate Change. CCUS activities can allow the acquisition of Carbon Credits, which can be
used to pay the Special Tax on Products and Services (see point 8 below).

There are some aspects of CCUS projects that are protected under present regulations. For instance,
environmental permits, such as the Environmental Impact Authorization, which is required for most
industrial activities and construction works and the Sole Environmental License, created as a
mechanism to merge several permits required of heavy industries, such as chemical industries, oil
and gas sector, refineries, petrochemical activities, production of paint and printing inks, automotive
industries, production of cellulose and paper, metallurgical production, glass production, electricity
generation, asbestos, cement producers and treatment of hazardous waste and materials, would be
required for CCUS activities. Preferential rights regarding superficial occupation and right of way
of the hydrocarbons sector are also provided for in the Hydrocarbons Law, and should be
considered important tools for CCUS projects, provided that the projects are related with energy
generation or with the oil sector. Other preferential rights are included in several other areas of law.
However, these are considered relevant for the particular activities at hand.

ASEA is expected to issue rules and guidelines regarding control and monitoring of capture,
exploration, extraction and injection of CO2 streams in order to improve hydrocarbons production,
according to Article 5° of the ASEA Act.

There is currently no clear classification of CO2 in the context of CCUS, which is a barrier for the
implementation of CCUS projects. According to Mexican Law, CO2 can, under current legislation,
be categorized as an air emission, waste, hazardous waste, and even as a material227. Each one of
these categories involves the application of a different approach and a different framework, which
affects legal obligations and incentives. From the aforementioned categories, the classification of
CO2 as an air emission would allow the developers of the project to make use of the existing
capturing and monitoring framework set out in the General Law on Climate Change. If CO 2 is
categorized as a waste or hazardous waste, the legal mechanism for confinement of hazardous
materials in underground geological formations can be used. As in other countries, a combination
could be considered applying a different classification for the different main stages in the CCS
226

http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Mexico/1/MEXICO%20INDC%2003.30.2015.pdf.
227
    For a detailed presentation of the classification of CO2 under existing legal requirements, see key issue number 1 in the
detailed assessment table.

                                                                                                                          89
lifecycle. Finally, a more complicated classification would be that of CO2 as a material used for
EOR. .

3.1.6   Competent authorities and institutions

Certain government bodies and authorities have competences that are relevant for the
implementation of CCUS activities in Mexico and would be involved in the development of such
activities, either as regulatory authorities, technical advisory authorities or as participants in several
of the permitting procedures applicable to these activities.

          3.1.6.1    Environmental Authorities

The Constitutional Reform has set the basis for the creation of the National Agency for Industrial
Security and Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector (ASEA). This entity will be
responsible for regulating and monitoring the hydrocarbon industry in the field of industrial safety,
operational safety and protection of the environment. ASEA will establish conditions of protection
to perform characterization of sites, waste management, and pollution control and establish
technical elements for the country’s environmental and energy policies. To ensure the compliance
with such provisions, ASEA is also entitled to impose security measures and sanctions.

Besides ASEA, of which the competence is limited to the hydrocarbons’ sector, the main authorities
competent for the protection of the environment are SEMARNAT (Ministry of the Environment
and Natural Resources), PROFEPA (Attorney’s General Office for the Protection of the
Environment) and CONAGUA (National Waters Commission). SEMARNAT is competent to
administrate and regulate the sustainable use of Natural Resources, except for hydrocarbons and
radioactive materials. It is also entitled to establish Mexican Official Standards (NOMs) which will
be designed to promote the preservation and restoration of the environment. PROFEPA is entitled
to inspect and evaluate, among others, compliance with the regulations related with natural
resources, hazardous wastes, air emissions, wildlife, biosecurity and GMOs. CONAGUA is entitled
to control, inspect and penalize activities regulated by the Act on National Waters.

PROFEPA CONAGUA, ASEA, are entities depending on SEMARNAT and are competent to order
and perform inspection procedures and sanctions. PROFEPA is entitled to inspect and evaluate,
amongst others, compliance with the regulations related with natural resources, hazardous wastes,
air emissions, wildlife, biosecurity and Genetically Modified Organisms. CONAGUA is entitled to
control, inspect and penalize activities regulated by the Act on National Waters.

          3.1.6.2    Authorities in the Energy Sector

With regard to the energy sector, the Ministry of Energy (SENER) and the National Hydrocarbons
Commission (CNH) are regarded as critical authorities for the implementation of CCUS projects.
SENER, as the regulatory authority for energy matters, is competent for establishing and
implementing the energy policies of Mexico, and to supervise their fulfilment, in a manner that
aims to protect the environment.

CNH is a Commission with technical autonomy in charge of regulating and supervising the
exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in Mexico. Its mission is to ensure that projects are
carried out under premises that can increase the recovery factor and obtain the maximum volume of
hydrocarbons in the long term. For this purpose, CNH was empowered in secondary legislation with
the following: i) regulating and monitoring the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons
including their integration into the system of transportation and storage; and b) management of

                                                                                                       90
     assignments and contracts for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons.

     Some of the aforementioned authorities are already working in coordination with SENER to
     promote CCUS projects, by means of creating a regulatory framework and geological studies
     available to the public. SEMARNAT and SENER are working together to achieve these goals in
     their respective fields at a federal level, SEMARNAT being the authority entitled to regulate and
     verify environmental aspects, and SENER as the authority entitled to regulate, and promote any
     project related with the generation of electricity and the hydrocarbons sector, as well as establish,
     guide and coordinate the national policy on energy, energy efficiency and environmental protection,
     as stated in Article 33 of the Internal Organizational Law of the Federal Public Administration. .
     The following chart shows specific abbreviations used in this section, as well as their meaning.

     The table in subsection 2 provides an assessment of the key regulatory aspects of CCUS activities in
     Mexico and provides a basis for the gap and barrier analysis which will take place in a following
     stage of this project. The key issues examined follow the same list as those being examined under
     the review of international best regulatory practices and policy models in the previous section. They
     aim at providing an understanding of the existing legal framework of key regulatory issues relevant
     for CCUS activities in Mexico.

General
 1. Classification of CO2 and       There is no specific framework to categorize CO2 for the purpose of CCUS in
     its legal implications         Mexico. However, there are 4 legal categories from different regulations that can be
                                    useful to classify CO2 for CCUS projects, according to the following:

                                    (i) Air Emission: CO2 is considered as an air emission as it is generated, and is subject
                                    to reporting by means of the COA228 (Annual Operations Inventory) in order to obtain
                                    and maintain the operational rights granted by the LAU ( Sole Environmental License).
                                    The LAU is an integrated permit merging several permits required for heavy
                                    industries. In order to obtain a LAU, the interested company must control and report
                                    its air emissions as well as the generation of hazardous waste. The classification of
                                    CO2 as an air emission could be useful for the regulation of the capture of CO 2 as it
                                    would require the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from industrial plants.
                                    (ii) Waste: any discarding material that has to be treated or disposed 229.
                                    (iii) Hazardous Waste: CO2 can be mixed with any other hazardous waste in order to
                                    be classified as hazardous waste. After that, CO2 is subject to the legal framework that
                                    allows materials to be contained in stable geological formations. This framework,
                                    although it was not created to store CO2, can be used as a legal base to allow CCUS




     228
         Article 3°, sections V and XIV of the Regulations on the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental
     Protection regarding Emissions and Pollutants Transfer.
     229
         Article 5°, section XIX, of the General Law on Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes.

                                                                                                                      91
                                     activities230. Specific requirements would be necessary to ensure the safe storage of
                                     CO2.
                                     (iv) Material:231 CO2 is considered an input for certain EOR practices. Therefore it
                                     may be classified as a material that can be used in a production process 232. However,
                                     in spite of the term, the existing legislation does not contain substantive requirements
                                     for materials.
                                     (vi) GHG: Although there is no specific definition for CO2 under Mexican regulation,
                                     CO2 is one of the criteria pollutants related to greenhouse effects. Therefore it is
                                     subject to the Regulations on the General Law on Climate Change regarding the
                                     National Emissions Registry and the Regulations on the General Law on
                                     Environmental Equilibrium and Environmental Protection regarding the National
                                     Emissons Registry and the Transfer of Pollutants.

                                     The classification of CO2 in each of the above categories could be relevant for the
                                     regulation of specific aspects of the CCS chain. Considering there is no specific
                                     framework to categorize CO2, any of the previous categories shall apply.

                                     Taking into account the development of the Regulations on the General Law on
                                     Climate Change regarding the National Emissions Registry and other federal
                                     environmental regulations related with CO2, it is understood that a new and specific
                                     regulation for monitoring and reporting should be issued to promote and develop CCS
                                     and CCUS projects, and this regulation can be developed after the General Law on
                                     Climate Change.
2.    Property rights                Mexican property rights can be divided between i) superficial rights and ii) subsoil
                                     property233. Superficial property is also categorized as: a) private property, belonging
                                     to any private legal entity; b) public property, belonging to the Mexican government
                                     in any of the three levels; and c) communal lands and ejido lands, as regulated by
                                     Mexican Agrarian Law, (Ley Agraria). Although communal lands and ejido lands
                                     used to have a rigid property transfer and acquisition scheme, after the Mexican
                                     Energy Reform the acquisition and rental of those lands related with energy projects,
                                     including facilities and right of way, has been simplified in the procedure established
                                     in Article 100 of the Hydrocarbons Act.

                                     ii) The subsoil is considered to be the property of the Mexican State, especially
                                     regarding any minerals, hydrocarbons, radioactive elements and underground
                                     aquifers. However, there is no regulation of pore space under Mexican law, thus pore
                                     space is regarded as subsoil and subject to the same regulation.

                                     Intellectual Property Rights and Industrial Property (IPR) regarding capture,
                                     characterization, and exploration technologies are not specifically covered, except
                                     where related with data regarding geological information of oil and gas fields, in
                                     which case the CNH is the competent authority that keeps that information 234.
                                     However, SENER and the National Geological Service foresee the creation of a
                                     CCUS research center which will collaborate with other public entities, such as
                                     PEMEX and CFE, to identify deep saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs.
                                     This center will promote research and promotion of the fields that meet the criteria for
                                     CCUS activities, but any other IPR aspect will be covered by the Industrial Property



     230
         Article 2°, section VIII, and 91 section II, of the Regulations on the General Law on Prevention and Integral
     Management of Wastes.
     231
         Article 5°, section XVIII of the General Law on Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes.
     232
         Article 5°, section XXXV, of the General Law on Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes.
     233
         Property rights are developed in the Mexican Federal Constitution under Article 27, parragraph I and IV. Additionaly
     the Law on National Patrimony further develops the concept of National Property.
     234
         Articles 32 and 33 of the Hydrocarbons Act.

                                                                                                                          92
                                      Act.
3.    Competition with other          Mexican legislation does not explicitly regulate preferential rights for CCUS
      users and preferential          activities. However, if such projects involve EOR or any other hydrocarbon or
      rights issues                   electricity facilities, they can be subject to preferential rights under the Hydrocarbons
                                      Law235.

                                      Preferential rights are developed in the secondary regulation of the energy reform in
                                      order to promote exploration, extraction, transportation and industrial transformation
                                      of hydrocarbons, as well as the generation and distribution of electricity. Therefore,
                                      preferential rights imply that the use of land for the aforementioned economic
                                      activities is more important than any other economic activity, and the use of land and
                                      right of way will be granted, even if the land is already in use there is certain
                                      proceeding that allows the use of the land for the above mentioned activities.

                                      Careful consideration must be given to preferential rights of indigenous peoples and
                                      communities regarding the use of its natural resources in their territories according to
                                      article 2° of the Mexican Constitution. In this regard, the Mexican Supreme Court of
                                      Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación) or a federal judge has the
                                      competence to issue the necessary criteria to solve conflicts of preferential rights as
                                      they may arise.

                                      Any project related with the exploration, production, distribution and transportation of
                                      hydrocarbons has preferential rights over any other project, including mining
                                      projects236. Among the hydrocarbons-related projects, preferential rights of the oil
                                      deposits have been granted to PEMEX through Ronda 0, and there is another bidding
                                      process of depleting oil areas, whose oil production can be enhanced through CCUS,
                                      which will be granted to private and state productive companies. Private companies
                                      and PEMEX will be allowed to associate and hire other enterprises to perform any
                                      process that can improve their performance 237 as a result of the restructure of PEMEX
                                      and the Mexican energy reform.

                                      With regard to mining projects, if any development is related with carbon-gas
                                      deposits, the concessionaries of those deposits have preferential rights over its
                                      deposits for future developments, and over the adjacent fields and geological deposits,
                                      according to the Mining Act238.
4.    Composition of the CO2          There is no definition of the CO2 stream in the Mexican regulatory framework.
      stream
                                      The only regulation that actually foresees the deposit of any kind of substance in
                                      geological cavities is the Regulation on the General Law for the Prevention and
                                      Integral Management of Wastes, which states that only hazardous materials or wastes
                                      can be confined in geologically stable formations. Any plans to create a new
                                      regulation relating to CCS and CCUS activities would therefore need to be duly
                                      analyzed.

                                    Act239.
5.    Engaging the public in        The opinion of local communities close to any infrastructure project is of the utmost
      decision making               importance according to several regulations, even if CCUS are not referred to directly.
                                    Mexican law includes four different mechanisms to engage the public in decision
                                    making:

                                    Firstly, the LGEEPA and its regulations on environmental impact assessment 240
                                    includes two mechanisms for including public opinion in the decision making process,
                                    namely the Social Consultation241 and the Experts consultation242 as part of the
                                    Environmental Impact Assessment. A Social Consultation takes place if, for the
                                    development of a project under Federal jurisdiction, any inhabitant of the community
                                    requests this procedure, and it is an opportunity for local communities to propose
                                    mitigation and compensation measures for the Environmental Impact Assessment,
                                    considering that SEMARNAT (for most industrial activities) and ASEA (with regard
                                    to projects related to the hydrocarbons’ sector) consider, at their sole discretion, these
                                    mitigation and compensation measures critical to grant the authorization. For the
                                    Social Consultation request, SEMARNAT has legal capacity to decide if such
                                    consultation has to be carried out or not. On the other hand, an Expert consultation is
                                    performed by specialized and certified technicians in order to provide the necessary
                                    knowledge to decide on specific aspects of the Environmental Impact Authorization,
                                    which is the legal document granted by the environmental authority (i.e.
                                    SEMARNAT or ASEA) after the successful conclusion of the Environmental Impact
                                    Evaluation.

                                    The third mechanism for public consultation is regulated under the Hydrocarbons
                                    Law, which establishes that before the construction of any upstream, downstream or
                                    midstream project, it is necessary to perform a Social Impact Assessment in order to
                                    protect the interest of local communities and indigenous peoples243. The Social Impact
                                    Assessment is performed by SENER, or the interested party depending on the case:
                                    SENER is in charge of performing this consultation before the opening of a bidding
                                    process, and the interested party must realize this consultation as a previous
                                    requirement to obtain any permit stated in the Hydrocarbons Act244.

                                    Additionally, Mexican Agrarian Law establishes certain requirements in order to have
                                    occupation and property access of agrarian land. No agrarian land can be sold without
                                    the authorization of the general assembly (asamblea ejidal) or the equivalent authority
                                    for communal lands, for which it is necessary to grant plain domain to the legal
                                    possessor of the land for selling such agrarian land and convert it into private

                                    Article 1 of the Mexican Federal Constitution establishes that any Human Right
                                    contained in International Law instruments are binding for the Mexican State.

                                    indigenous peoples and original inhabitants is compulsory and currently applied by
                                    SENER, as one of the necessary requirements for the issuance of any permit regulated
                                    under the Hydrocarbons Act. On environmental matters, there is no internal regulation
                                    that includes any of the obligations established under ILO Convention 169.

                                    Each one of the previous cases is an opportunity to enjoin the authorization and
                                    eventually appeal before the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice, which has developed
                                    its own Decision Guidelines on The Development of Infrastructure Projects 245.
6.    Scope of framework and        CCUS projects are not subject to any specified prohibitions. The legal framework is
      prohibitions                  distributed in different acts and regulations. However, CCUS projects will be subject
                                    to the environmental prohibitions implemented for any infrastructure project, such as
                                    for projects in protected natural areas and other reserves. Additionally, CCUS
                                    projects, as any other infrastructure project, will have to follow Federal, State and
                                    local prohibitions related with ecological ordinances and land-use programs and urban
                                    development programs in order to obtain the required environmental permits.
7.    Definition     of    ´CCS     Not regulated.
      ready´
8.    Incentives for CCS as         Mexican Income Tax Law includes certain dispositions related with mitigation
      part of climate mitigation    measures for the mitigation of pollutant emissions. These regulations include tax
      strategies                    benefits for the development of new technologies and the acquisition of new
                                    machinery, which allows the deduction of up to 35% of the price of the machinery.

                                    Trade of Carbon Credits inside the Mexican market is another mechanism to promote
                                    the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Taking into account the great potential of
                                    mitigation of CCUS projects, they will also offer considerable benefits in terms of
                                    Carbon Credits. Carbon Credits, although its implementation in Mexico is in an initial
                                    stage, can provide tax aids, such as the payment of certain taxes and other financial
                                    benefits, as stated in article 95 of the General Law on Climate Change. There are
                                    several companies using the Carbon Market scheme at its actual stage, with the
                                    participation of the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores).

                                    The Special Tax on Production and Services, or IEPS, is a new tax imposed on certain
                                    activities, such as hydrocarbons’ production246. This tax can be paid using Carbon
                                    Credits, provided that the hydrocarbons’ production is developed in Mexico and the
                                    Carbon Credits are certified according to the United Nations Framework Convention
                                    on Climate Change.

                                    Additionally, machinery and technology importation are other ways to make use of
                                    tax and financial incentives in order to benefit CCUS projects. Normally machinery
                                    import is subject to certain duties, which in the case of CCUS projects, considered
                                    ultimate technology with the only purpose of improving the environment, will not be
                                    charged247.

                                    In the same way, the General Law on Climate change foresees the possibility to
                                    establish incentives for climate change mitigation in its Article 94. It states, moreover,
                                    that any person interested in participating in the emissions market (Carbon Market)
                                    will be allowed to take part and sell Carbon Credits in international markets 248.




     245
         This Protocol sets the actions and principles tube followed in jurisdictional decisions regarding the protection of
     indigenous rights and peoples.
     246
         Articles 5 and 2, section I h) of the Law on Production and Services Tax.
     247
         According to paragraph 9806.00.03 of the Customs Act.
     248
         Article 95 of the General Law on Climate Change.

                                                                                                                         95
                                   In addition to technology import, machinery related with CCUS projects is subject to
                                   accelerated depreciation, which is a mechanism to obtain financial and tax benefits 249.
                                   Accelerated depreciation represents tax benefits as it is an instrument to allow tax
                                   deduction as machinery ages, which can be considered as an income flow.
CO2 capture
 9. Authorization for capture      There is no specific authorization for carbon capture in Mexico, but there are
                                   instruments for monitoring and controlling atmospheric emissions in Mexico, such as
                                   the Sole Environmental License250. Although it is not a license specifically designed
                                   for CCUS projects, the Sole Environmental is required for all industrial facilities
                                   enlisted as Federal stationary sources of air emissions, such as: chemical industries,
                                   oil and gas sector, refineries, petrochemical activities, production of paint and printing
                                   inks, automotive industries, production of cellulose and paper, metallurgical
                                   production, glass production, electricity generation, asbestos, cement producers and
                                   treatment of hazardous waste and materials.

                                   The Regulations of the General Law on Climate Change on the National Registry
                                   Emissions states that any facility generating more than 25 000 tons of CO 2 is subject
                                   to reporting. This report will be sent to the SEMARNAT and will include the
                                   composition of the gases and greenhouse compounds, according to article 87 of the
                                   General Law on Climate Change. More detailed requirements for the reporting to the
                                   National Emissions Registry will be published in the coming weeks.

                                   Within the sector of hydrocarbons and after the issuance of the Energy Reform,
                                   ASEA is the governmental entity in charge of regulating capture, exploration,
                                   transportation and industrial CO2 injection for projects that improve the extraction of
                                   hydrocarbons251.

                                   Finally, the General Law on Climate Change provides for the regulation of
                                   atmospheric emissions of gases and greenhouse compounds 252, as well as carbon
                                   sequestration in the agriculture sector253. It is herein stated that the any governmental
                                   entity will work on the promotion of public policies and mitigation activities related
                                   to: i) emissions’ reduction and carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector, as well
                                   as forest and other ecosystems, and ii) maintaining and promoting carbon sinks.
 10. Monitoring,    reporting      There are two main ways to perform the monitoring and verification of the capture
     and          verification     activities: through control instruments provided by SEMARNAT and through private
     requirements                  certifiers.

                                   The SEMARNAT is responsible for the control of air emissions through the Sole
                                   Environmental License. This license must be obtained from the SEMARNAT before
                                   the onset of industrial operations. The Sole Environmental License does not have an
                                   expiration date, but its validity is extended year by year if the Annual Operations
                                   Inventory is filed on time, containing records of the different air emissions and
                                   pollutants transference generated by a facility.

                                   The National Emissions Registry (Registro Nacional de Emisiones), as established in
                                   the General Law on Climate Change254, is an instrument created to compile all the
                                   necessary information with regard to GHG produced as a result of industrial
                                   transformation and energy generation.

                                     NOMs take an important role in the monitoring and limitation of GHG emissions. The
                                     following NOMs have been issued by SEMARNAT and will be related to CCS and
                                     CCUS projects, unless specific regulations are created:
                                     (i) NOM-137-SEMARNAT-2013, Atmospheric Pollution. – Gas Processing facilities
                                     – Emission Controls of sulfur compounds.
                                     (ii) NOM-085-SEMARNAT-2011, Atmospheric Pollution –Maximum emission
                                     levels and measure methods on direct heating process.
                                     (iii) NOM-148-SEMARNAT-2006, Atmospheric Pollution – Sulfur recuperation from
                                     oil refining processes.
                                     (iv) NOM-043-SEMARNAT-1993, Maximum permissible limits for emissions in the
                                     atmosphere resulting from fixed sources.

                                     Certification of emissions through a private agency is another modality to monitor the
                                     CO2 produced and captured. This certification is not legally required, but will be an
                                     appropriate instrument to monitor air emissions and add credibility to the reports. In
                                     Mexico, organizations such as the Mexican Accreditation Entity (EMA) offer a
                                     special program for carbon capture and issues certificates of the quantities retained. 255

                                     Additionally, the regulation of atmospheric emissions and greenhouse compounds256,
                                     as well as carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector, is provided for in the General
                                     Law on Climate Change257.
  11. Inspection                     The inspection procedure is likely to be performed by the PROFEPA in the case of
                                     installations on shore and not related to the oil or gas industries under Federal
                                     jurisdiction and ASEA if the project is related to the hydrocarbons ’ sector, regardless
                                     of the location of these projects or their links to aquifers.

                                     Inspection procedures performed by the aforementioned authorities mentioned can be
                                     done in two ways: i) randomly, for each one of those authorities is entitled to do so,
                                     and ii) and as a consequence of an environmental complaint done by members of the
                                     community or environmental authorities258.

                                     A third verification procedure is the self-regulation and environmental audits’ system
                                     for the industry under Federal jurisdiction. This means that the project has
                                     mechanisms to regulate and monitor its environmental performance, and define the
                                     necessary preventive and corrective measures. This system exceeds mandatory
                                     environmental standards and is subject to environmental and tax benefits proposed by
                                     SEMARNAT.

                                     Within the hydrocarbons’ sector and after the entry into force of the Energy reform,
                                     ASEA is in charge of issuing the corresponding regulation regarding capture,
                                     exploration, transportation and industrial CO2 injection for projects that improve the
                                     extraction of hydrocarbons259. See below.
CO2 transport
 12. Authorization              of   There is no existing regulation for the transportation of CO 2 for CCUS projects.
      transportation                 However, the main authority responsible for the authorization of such a project would

                                 authorizations, among other authorizations260.

                                 Technical similarities in the transport of CO2 with the transportation of natural gas
                                 leads one to think that the Regulatory Energy Commission could request the
                                 respective authorizations normally used for the transport of natural gas, depending on
                                 the technical characteristics of the project and the methods for transporting the CO 2. It
                                 is expected to be transported by pipelines, wheels and ships, and therefore subject to
                                 the permits and authorization of the Secretary of Communication and Transport.

                                 Finally, in the case of pipeline transportation, it is important to acquire rights of way
                                 across federal, local and municipal roads. These rights must be obtained in the
                                 corresponding entity of the federal state and local government, and also from the land
                                 owners and holders of the areas.

                                 As in capture authorizations described in number 9 of this document, ASEA will be in
                                 charge of issuing the corresponding adjustment with the capture, as well as overseeing
                                 transportation and industrial CO2 injection for projects that improve the extraction of
                                 hydrocarbons261. Secondary regulation has not yet been issued. The developer of the
                                 project is also obliged to inform the Ministry of the Interior of any risk that arises or
                                 may arise262.
13. Third-party access      to   Third-party access to transportation infrastructure is not specially designed for CCUS
    transportation               projects. Nevertheless, after the Mexican Energy Reform entered into force,
    infrastructure               regulations for third-party access for transportation of liquefied natural gas was
                                 issued263. These regulations could be construed and interpreted to permit third-party
                                 access to transportation infrastructure of CCUS projects, provided the infrastructure
                                 complies with the technical requirements for CO2 transportation and the authority
                                 agrees to construe these regulations in order to enable CO 2 transportation. The
                                 establishment of Integrated Systems (Sistemas Integrados) which are interconnected
                                 pipelines and storage facilities that provide transportation services to third parties is
                                 provided for in the Hydrocarbon Law. However, it is of great importance to determine
                                 whether the Integrated Systems will have the technical characteristics to provide
                                 transportation services for CCUS projects, as well as to establish if the use of
                                 transportation services will be limited to hydrocarbons’ transportation 264.
14. Transboundary                CO2, if categorized as hazardous waste, is subject to the Basel Convention 265. Mexico
    movement of CO2              is a State Party of the Basel Convention, which includes a legal framework that
                                 regulates transboundary movement of CO2, as well as the liability related to these
                                 activities.

                                 The Basel Convention develops requirements and measures for the transportation of
                                 hazardous wastes. Among the different measures contained in the Convention, the
                                 transportation of pollutants is only permitted under an adequate management to
                                 protect the environment. Furthermore, the notification of the State that generates the
                                 hazardous wastes must be accepted by the State that receives such hazardous wastes.

                                 Mexico ratified the London Protocol on 24 March 2006, and published a Decree
                                 containing the London Protocol on the Official Gazette of the Federation, stating in
                                 the Decree that the London Protocol entered into force for Mexico on the same day of

                                     If CO2 is considered hazardous waste, it will be necessary under the London Protocol,
                                     for transport passing through international waters, to provide an agreement between
                                     the two countries involved in the transportation of CO2 including the confirmation and
                                     allocation of permitting responsibilities between the exporting and receiving
                                     countries, even if the USA has not ratified the London Protocol.

                                     If the receiving country is not a Party under the London Protocol, equivalent
                                     provisions to those contained in the London Protocol will apply to ensure the
                                     protection of the maritime environment at least by one of the signing parties involved
                                     in the exportation or importation of CO2. In any case, a contracting Party entering into
                                     such an agreement must notify the International Maritime Organization 266.
                                     For transboundary transport over land, bilateral agreements can be concluded between
                                     Mexico and its neighboring countries, as have been concluded in the past for
                                     transportation of other substances, such as gas.

                                     Lastly, for projects related with Enhanced Oil Recovery267, ASEA will also be entitled
                                     to regulate and supervise capture, exploration, transport, and industrial injection of
                                     CO2268.
CO2 storage and usage
 15. Definitions           and       There is no precise definition of CO2 storage or to any other process of CCUS
      terminology applicable to      activities in the current regulatory framework in Mexico.
      CO2 storage                    The LGPGIR (General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes)
                                     includes a framework in which CO2 could be captured if mixed with any pollutant
                                     considered as hazardous waste. This would make the existing legislation on hazardous
                                     waste confinement in geological formations applicable269. However, careful
                                     consideration should be given to the legal requirements for hazardous waste
                                     applicable in this case. Moreover, specific requirements would still be needed to tailor
                                     to the specific needs of CCUS activities.

                                     CO2 storage is mentioned in the ASEA Act270, although restricted to Enhanced Oil
                                     Recovery Projects. This regulation states that Enhanced Oil Recovery is an industrial
                                     method to improve oil production, and gives ASEA the necessary powers to regulate
                                     and supervise CCUS activities related to oil and gas recovery. However, the provision
                                     that foresees the competence of ASEA is not specific enough to envisage specific
                                     provisions, it only states that the ASEA shall regulate and supervise according to its
                                     attribution in the hydrocarbon sector, capture, exploration, transport, and industrial
                                     storage of CO2.

  17. Authorization of storage       Although there is not a unique databank for CCUS activities, information concerning
      site exploration activities    the sites and deposits is in the hands of the Mexican Geological Service 271 for the
                                     basins related to mines and the CNH and Pemex for deposits related to the

                                  exploitation of oil and gas. The Mexican Geological Service is entitled to provide
                                  geological and geophysical information of the country, as well as to update the
                                  Mexican Geological Atlas.

                                  The information of hydrocarbons’ exploration and exploitation deposited is subject to
                                  strict confidentiality and can only be obtained through the several agreements for
                                  exploration and extraction that the National Hydrocarbons Commission offers. For
                                  this reason, the only way to obtain this information is by creating partnerships with
                                  companies that have these contracts and knowledge, such as Petróleos Mexicanos and
                                  the other companies participating in the Round 1. It is also relevant that the third
                                  tender within Round 1 covers the tender from mature wells, where CCUS EOR
                                  technology can be applied if an alliance with oil companies that have the information
                                  is established. Currently Round 1 is offering license contracts for mature areas, where
                                  CCUS and Enhanced Oil Recovery can be used and a partnership with any of those
                                  companies could take place.

    and        characterization   regulated.
    activities                    However, SENER in conjunction with CFE and the Mexican Geological Survey
                                  (Servicio Geológico Mexicano) is preparing an Atlas containing sites with potential
                                  for CCUS activities, both in the petroleum sector and in mining deposits. The Atlas
                                  will be accessible to the public in order to promote CCUS activities and reduce the
                                  investment needed for the exploration of the sites.

                                  For the moment, mining companies and oil companies have the information on the
                                  characterization and relevant seismological studies, as well as preferential rights on
                                  the site.
19. Authorization of storage      There is currently no explicit legal requirement for the authorization of CO 2 storage
    activities                    activities in Mexico.
                                  There is an authorization for the final confinement of hazardous waste 272 which could
                                  potentially serve as a framework for CCUS projects. Through this authorization, the
                                  injection of hazardous wastes is regulated in order to dispose of such materials in the
                                  subsoil for its confinement in geological formations. This means that CO 2 must be
                                  mixed with a material considered as a hazardous waste, and thus take advantage of the
                                  legal framework existing in the field of hazardous waste for CCUS. This authorization
                                  is granted by SEMARNAT in most of the cases, or ASEA, if the hazardous waste
                                  results from hydrocarbon industries. In order to obtain this authorization, the operator
                                  must provide that the CO2 will not damage any underground or superficial aquifers.
                                  SEMARNAT will provide the corresponding form, and the operator will deliver, in
                                  addition to the form, the relevant studies to support that no damage will be caused to
                                  aquifers. The operation must also provide the relevant technical information of the
                                  process, as well as diagrams explaining it.

                                  An implementing regulation for the storage of CO2 is still pending, despite the fact
                                  that it is already foreseen that ASEA is the authority in charge of issuing such
                                  regulation and overseeing industrial CO2 injection to improve the production of
                                  hydrocarbons273.
20. International laws for the    While there are various international agreements concerning the protection of the
    protection of the marine      marine environment in the event of spills, and other environmental damage, there are
    environment.                  no specific arrangements for CCUS projects.

                                  The London Protocol is applicable, generically, for CCUS projects. This Protocol on

                                   the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter regulates
                                   dumping and defines it as:
                                   i) any deliberate disposal into the sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft,
                                   platforms or other man-made structures at sea; ii) any deliberate disposal into the sea
                                   of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;
                                   iii) Any storage of wastes or other matter in the seabed and the subsoil thereof from
                                   vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea.

                                   Taking into account those broad definitions, CCUS projects can be considered subject
                                   to the London Protocol.

                                   Mexico has been a party to the London Convention since 1987 and to the London
                                   Protocol since 2006.

                                   The other major international environmental agreements, such as the PIC Convention
                                   and the Stockholm Convention are not specifically relevant for CCS activities.
                                   However, specific restrictions on, for example, wetlands as regulated in the Ramsar
                                   Convention, have been integrated in nature protection legislation and are addressed
                                   under this section.
21. Project inspections            The CCUS storage facilities will be submitted to the inspection procedures of the
                                   PROFEPA, the Ministry of Navy, (SEMAR) CONAGUA and the ASEA, depending
                                   on the characteristics of the project and its linkage with the hydrocarbons ’ sector.
                                   PROFEPA is responsible for the inspection in the case of installations which are not
                                   related to the hydrocarbon sector. The Ministry of the Navy is the authority
                                   responsible for the inspection and control activities in the Mexican overseas.
                                   CONAGUA is the entity responsible for the inspection of national water related
                                   projects not related to hydrocarbon projects. And ASEA is the entity in charge of
                                   inspecting storage facilities if the project is related to the exploration or exploitation
                                   of hydrocarbons, and is an entity empowered to supervise the capture, transport and
                                   injection of CO2 for enhanced oil extraction.

                                   Inspections can be carried out at any time by the said authorities, or can arise from a
                                   complaint initiated by members of the community or the authorities 274.

                                   In the event that there is any anomaly detected in the inspection procedure, the
                                   environmental authority will start an administrative procedure and may order security
                                   measures, as well as the respective sanctions275.
22. Monitoring,    reporting       There is no specific regulation of the monitoring, reporting and verification of storage
    and          verification      or use activities. However, there are provisions, derived from the LGEEPA, for risk
    requirements                   related industrial projects. Current legislation is likely to comprise CCUS storage, use,
                                   and transportation as environmentally, highly risky activities. The obligations of
                                   reporting and verification are also established in every Environmental Impact
                                   Authorization required for this type of project.
23. Corrective measures and        According to the LGEEPA, corrective measures derived from the inspection of
    remediation measures           PROFEPA and SEMARNAT vary depending on the case and the specifications of the
                                   project and the possibility of environmental damage 276. It is important that the
                                   operator will be required to apply corrective or remediation measures in most of the
                                   cases and depending on the physical aspects and risks of the project.

                                  On the other hand, security measures will be applied by SEMARNAT and ASEA
                                  directly277, provided there is an imminent risk of ecological imbalance, damage,
                                  deterioration of natural resources, contamination, dangers for the environment or
                                  public health278. According to that, security measures are the following:

                                   (i)             Closed down
                                   (ii)            Decommission of material and hazardous waste,
                                   (iii)           Neutralization of materials and hazardous waste.
24. Liability    during     the   The liability during the project includes the implementation of the Federal Law on
    project period                Environmental Responsibility and the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and
                                  Environmental Protection.

                                  In the first case, the Federal Law on Environmental Responsibility sets forth liability
                                  for environmental damage, as well as mitigation and compensation measures.
                                  According to this law, any person that affects the environment is considered
                                  responsible for repairing the damage.

                                  Another characteristic according to the LFRA is that liability is limited by the
                                  principle of legality, i.e. only unfulfilling the Environmental Impact Authorization or
                                  Mexican Official Standards or other legal requirements can be considered as
                                  environmental damage.

                                  The General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection
                                  establishes several sanctions against breaches of the environmental regulation. These
                                  sanctions are enforced by the SEMARNAT, unless it is of topics related to
                                  hydrocarbons, for which the ASEA is the authorized entity. Penalties to which
                                  offenders might be subjected include the following:

                                           (i)        Fines
                                           (ii)       Definite or temporal closure
                                           (iii)      Arrest
                                           (iv)       Withdrawals of licenses, permits and authorizations279.

                                  Likewise, there is other specific legislation, such as the General Law for the
                                  Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes that also establishes several sanctions
                                  against breaches of the environmental regulation related to the matters such
                                  legislation was created for. Additionally there are criminal charges for those that
                                  infringe the environmental legal framework, conditions established for the project,
                                  damage caused by negligence on ecosystems, wildlife or people.
25. Liability during the post-    The provisions and conditions of the closure of the project are contained in the
    closure period                Environmental Impact Authorization, as well as the regulation issued by
                                  SEMARNAT and ASEA. On the other hand, even after the termination of the project,
                                  any project is still responsible for any environmental damage for twelve years, as
                                  stated in the Federal Law on Environmental Responsibility (LFRA), and in case of
                                  hazardous waste confinement and storage the responsibility is extended up to 20
                                  years280. This means that even after the closure of the project, the individuals are in
                                  the scope of application of the LFRA.

  26. Financial contributions to   There is no specific regulation for CCUS projects in matters of post-closure.
      post-closure stewardship     Therefore CCUS projects should follow post closure measures indicated by
                                   SEMARNAT or ASEA, or propose those measures in the corresponding
                                   Environmental Impact Evaluation.

                                   establishes the option to create a financial warranty that will be capitalized with
                                   periodic payments and will cover any potential damage in which the company shall be
                                   held liable.
  27. Using CCS for biomass-       There are no projects using CCS for biomass-based sources currently envisaged in
      based sources                Mexico.
  28. Enhanced hydrocarbon         Not regulated. Although it is referred to in the Hydrocarbons Law 281, and in the
      recovery with CCS            ASEA Act, there are no specific rules for Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects.

                               The regulation for EOR activities is still pending, despite the fact that ASEA is
                               already entitled to issue regulations and inspect any industrial project consisting of the
                               CO2 injection to improve the production of hydrocarbons 282.
Environmental and health and safety requirements applicable to all stages
 29. Planning    requirements The first step in a CCUS project would be the acquisition of the right to use the
     (e.g.           Strategic surface, which in the case of projects related to the exploration, production and
     environmental             transportation of hydrocarbons, involves a special regime that facilitates the
     assessment)               occupation of the land and the use of the right of way 283.

                                   In contrast to the environmental framework of other countries, Mexico does not
                                   include a procedure to change the ecological zoning of the territory or any other
                                   spatial plans. Those plans and ecological zoning are issued periodically by federal,
                                   state and municipal authorities and there is no procedure, such as a Strategic
                                   Environmental Assessment applicable to them.

                                   Secondly, there is the issuance of the Environmental Impact Authorization, which
                                   must be obtained in accordance with article 28 of the LGEEPA (see point 30). In
                                   order to obtain this authorization the project must be consistent with public policy
                                   instruments and regulation related to the project. Public Policy Instruments are
                                   derived from the National Development Plan. This National Development Plan is the
                                   basis for sectorial, institutional, regional and special programs that also establishes
                                   requirements for infrastructure projects. In other words, those programs consist of
                                   economic mechanisms that work as a framework to determine the aims and objectives
                                   of the federal state and local governments as well as the methods to achieve those
                                   goals. In order to obtain an Environmental Impact Authorization, the party requiring it
                                   must present a chapter stating the benefits of the project and its relation with National
                                   Policies, such as the National Policy on Climate Change and the Special Program on
                                   Climate Change, both elaborated by SEMARNAT. The Special Program on Climate
                                   change foresees the development of Pilot Projects with CFE and EOR projects with
                                   PEMEX284.
                                   The ecological zoning of the territory is the instrument of environmental policy whose
                                   purpose is to regulate and induce the use of soil and the productive activities to
                                   achieve a sustainable use of natural resources. There are four types of ecological
                                   ordering programs:

     281
         Article, section XV of the Hydrocarbons Law.
     282
         Article 5°, section XIX of the Internal Organizational Law of the National Agency for Industrial Security and
     Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector.
     283
         Article 100 of the Hydrocarbons Law.
     284
         Section 3.1.4 of the Special Program on Climate Change, section 3.1.4.

                                                                                                                  103
                                   (i) General Ecological Ordering
                                   (ii) Regional Ecological Ordering
                                   (iii) Local Ecological Ordering
                                   (iv) Marine Ecological Ordering
                                   Each of these ecological ordering programs has a close relation with the environment
                                   and is part of the Authority’s criteria to approve any kind of industrial project.
30. Environmental       impact     The Environmental Impact Assessment is the process in which the corresponding
    Assessment                     environmental authority (i.e. ASEA for the hydrocarbons sector and SEMARNAT for
                                   any other industrial activity or construction works) reviews the information previously
                                   filed by the requesting person, in order to evaluate the technical aspects of the project,
                                   applicable environmental legislation and expected environmental impacts. If the
                                   environmental authority considers that the project complies with the necessary
                                   requirements, it will grant an Environmental Impact Authorization, which will
                                   normally provide further measures to promote the conservation of the environment
                                   and avoid environmental damages or imbalances.

                                   The Environmental Impact Authorization marks the successful conclusion of the
                                   Environmental Impact Assessment and is ideally granted within 60 business days as
                                   of submission as required by the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and
                                   Environmental Protection (LGEEPA). However, the procedure may be suspended for
                                   as long as 60 additional days if the authority deems that further information is
                                   required from the proponent of the project (investor). Also, the term may be extended
                                   if the complexity of the project so requires. In the end, issuance of an Authorization
                                   may take up to 180 business days. A LGEEPA Regulation sets out the detailed
                                   procedural requirements for the EIA procedure.
31. Pollution     prevention       Project-related pollution is overseen by SEMARNAT for projects of confinement of
    requirements (air, water,      hazardous materials and waste, and ASEA, who will inspect and control the
    subsoil)                       environmental conditions to prevent contamination by waste generated by the
                                   activities of the sector, whose disposal may cause salinization and excessive increases
                                   in organic loading in soils and water bodies in the sites where such activities are
                                   carried out285.

                                   To update the registry database, establishments subject to federal jurisdiction should
                                   present information on their releases and transfers of pollutants to air, water, soil and
                                   subsoil, materials and waste, as stated in Article 19 and 20 of these rules, as well as
                                   those substances as determined by the Ministry subject to reporting in the
                                   corresponding Official Mexican Standard. The information is to be provided through
                                   the Annual Operation Report.

                                   In terms of air, the Sole Environmental License286 is the instrument that aims to
                                   monitor emissions into the atmosphere from different sources, of both CO 2 emissions
                                   and other gases.
                                   This license must be renewed every year through an Annual Operation Inventory,
                                   which is a report of the different emissions generated by certain facilities on bi-
                                   monthly periods.
32. Nature         legislation     Limits and prohibitions for any infrastructure project will apply for CCUS projects as
    requirements                   well, for there is no specific CCUS regulation at the moment. In matters of habitat
    (consideration          of     protection and wildlife the most important regulations are developed in the General
    protected habitats and         Wildlife Act (Ley General de Vida Silvestre) Land-Use Programs and Ecological
    species)                       Management Programs.

                                   subject to special requirements of environmental protection, conservation, restoration
                                   and development according to the LGEEPA and the Ecological Management
                                   Programs, among others.

                                   Ecological Management Programs regulate Natural Protected Areas and are defined
                                   as the planning and regulating instrument that establishes activities and guidelines for
                                   the management of each Natural Protected Areas287.

                                   Ecological Management Programs and Land-Use Programs are legal instruments
                                   issued by the executive (at Federal, State and local levels) in order to establish the
                                   requirements, prohibitions and objectives of certain territorial areas, in both
                                   environmental and urban subjects.

                                   The General Law on Wildlife288 sets out that economic activities have to be performed
                                   according to Land-Use Programs and Ecological Management Programs, as well as
                                   Mexican Official Standards. Specifically, the Mexican Official Standard “NOM-059-
                                   SEMARNAT-2010” sets out specific regulation regarding species subject to special
                                   protection, which is a constraint for the construction of any infrastructure project that
                                   affects, or could risk, the habitat of those species.

                                   In relation to forestry vegetation, the General Law for Sustainable Forestry
                                   Development (Ley General para el Desarrollo Forestal Sustentable) includes, as an
                                   exception, the authorization for forestry vegetation removal for which an
                                   authorization must be obtained by filing a technical justified study and paying
                                   sometimes a substantial amount to the National Forestry Fund for each one of the
                                   species to be removed.
33. Waste        legislation       The General Law on the prevention and management of waste, and its implementing
    requirements                   regulation, establishes the general framework for waste management in Mexico and
                                   organizes the distribution of competences in this matter.
                                   Depending on the type of waste generated, the implementation of a Waste
                                   Management Plan could be necessary289. A Waste Management Plan is an instrument
                                   created to minimize waste generation and evaluate hazardous waste, special
                                   management waste and solid urban waste290.
34. Coastal     and    marine      Regulations and guidelines with regard to coastal and maritime protection derive from
    protection requirements        the powers of SEMARNAT, PROFEPA, CONAGUA and ASEA. Superficial waters
                                   are regulated under the General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental
                                   Protection, which is applied by SEMARNAT and PROFEPA in projects not related to
                                   the hydrocarbon sector and by ASEA if the project involves the production or
                                   transport of Hydrocarbons. The federal maritime zone and land gained from the sea
                                   are regulated under the General Law of National Assets (Ley General de Bienes
                                   Nacionales) and its specific regulations on federal maritime zone matters and is
                                   applied by SEMARNAT and PROFEPA in projects not related to the hydrocarbon
                                   sector and by ASEA if the project involves the production of transport of
                                   Hydrocarbons. CONAGUA is the authority entitled to regulate and control National

       The General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Waste foresees several competences for the
   Federation, States and Local governments in order to reduce the amount of waste and provide better disposal measures for
   each category of waste, according to its toxicity.

                                                                                                                      105

                                       underground aquifers, and the federal zone of the portion of rivers that has no contact
                                       with the ocean.

                                       Depending on the location of the Project, it should be adapted to the corresponding
                                       Maritime Developing Program, which will include certain specification of the onshore
                                       and offshore locations, as well as the feasibility requirements to build any
                                       infrastructure that may cause an impact on the coastal area. This Maritime Developing
                                       Program will be taken into account to issue, or deny, the corresponding
                                       Environmental Impact Authorization.

                                       At the moment, there are three main Marine Development Programs according to the
                                       Federal Strategy on Ecological Development291: North Pacific (Pacifico Norte),
                                       Central- South Pacific (Pacífico Centro-Sur), and Golf of Mexico and the Caribbean
                                       (Golfo de México y Mar Caribe). These instruments include guidelines and
                                       obligations in order to maintain and promote environmental services and the
                                       preservation of ecosystems.
35. Coverage     by          GHG       Of the many incentives already exposed in number 8 of this chart “Incentives for CCS
    trading schemes                    as part of climate mitigation strategies” the most important is the Carbon Market.
                                       Carbon Credits are a valuable instrument to participate in the Carbon Market and
                                       receive revenues and tax benefits. The Special Tax on Production and Services Law
                                       also establishes that the extraction of oil and other fossil resources are subject to this
                                       new tax292. However, this tax can be paid completely through Carbon Credits.
36. Protecting human health            Regarding projects related with Enhanced Oil Recovery, ASEA is the federal
                                       authority entitled to apply and issue guidelines on industrial security systems.
                                       Any other CCUS project, not related with Enhanced Oil Recovery, will be left to
                                       STPS (Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare). This authority is competent to issue
                                       Mexican Official Standards protecting workers’ health.

                                       The environmental risk assessment is linked to the environmental impact statement.
                                       There are two lists that determine federal jurisdiction over activities considered highly
                                       risky. Within the procedure for access to the license, conditions on the environmental
                                       impact risk that should be considered are issued.

                                       Additionally, within the national system of metrology and standards, exists NMX-R-
                                       019-SCFI-2011 which establishes a harmonized system of classification and hazard
                                       communication of chemicals. Globally Harmonized System (GHS).

                                       There is a National Civil Protection Program 2014-2018 (PNPC). Development
                                       planning, according to the Civil Protection Act (LGPC) begins to analyze and take
                                       decisions based on the risk atlas. These instruments are the framework for the
                                       development of preventive public policies to mitigate the risk of disasters. This
                                       system is articulated to the National System of Civil Protection (NSCP) where the
                                       units responsible are specialized in risk management, as well as mechanisms for
                                       sharing information to protect public services.

                                       With regard to human health in general Mexico’s Health Secretary and its Federal
                                       Commission for Protection against Health Risks are entitled to prevent and control

                                    STPS is the other entity with authority to protect and improve workers’ health and the
                                    work environment. This Ministry of State has developed several Mexican Official

4     IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS AND BARRIERS IN THE MEXICAN REGULATORY
      FRAMEWORK FOR CCUS ACTIVITIES


The purpose of this chapter is to understand, from the analysis carried out of the international and
Mexican legal framework of CCUS activities, which gaps exist in the current Mexican legislation
with regard to legal requirements and provisions for CCUS activities and, derived from
international practices, how such gaps can be resolved. Likewise, a relevant part of the analysis is to
review if important barriers exist, either in existing legislation or in the solutions proposed to
address legal gaps, for the deployment of CCUS projects in Mexico.

The main purpose of this exercise is to try to find suitable solutions to the existing legal framework
in order for CCUS activities to be regulated in Mexico, by means of using the current legislation,
the creation of new legislation, or by amending the existing one. In this context, it should be noted
that, to date, no CCUS activities have been implemented in Mexico.



This gap and barrier analysis will provide a basis for the next chapter, namely recommendations to
the Mexican regulatory framework for the possible implementation of CCUS activities in Mexico.

4.1     CLASSIFICATION OF CO2 AND ITS LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

The classification of CO2 will have major implications on the way existing regulatory frameworks
might apply to CCS activities296, as the classification as a pollutant, waste, commodity or air
emission might apply different regulatory regimes to the several phases of a CCUS project, such as
the capture of CO2, EOR activities or permanent storage. It is, for that same reason, also highly
determined by the context in which new regulatory requirements for CCUS are being developed.
For example, existing legal requirements for pollutants from industrial installations might already
cover the emissions of CO2 as a pollutant. In this case, the classification of CO2 as a pollutant might
be useful for the regulation of CO2 capture activities. The classification of CO2 might also create
obstacles to the effective implementation of CCUS activities where existing legislation prohibits
certain activities involving CO2 from taking place, such as injection underground, or where the
requirements imposed are considered inappropriate or too onerous.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that the classification of CO2 is the first step to
effective regulation as it determines applicable legal requirements and establishes the following
options as common classification options for CO2: (a) hazardous (b) waste (c) pollutant/nuisance (d)
commodity. Furthermore, the purpose of the classification is to create a chain of custody from
source to storage.

In the EU, CO2 is classified as a pollutant when emitted297 and/or captured298. Therefore, legislation
concerning industrial emissions, as well general environmental legislation (concerning e.g.

296
    IEA CCS Model Regulatory framework.

Annex II of non-exhaustive list of pollutants.

activities in the EU. The CCS Directive, as a legal instrument specifically designed to regulate the
storage of CO2, refers specifically to CO2 without proceeding to a classification of the substance in
this legislation. Additionally, CO2 is explicitly excluded from the scope of application of waste
legislation299. In Canada, and in particular in the Province of Alberta, the classification of CO2 is
dependent on what it is used for and the scope of the applicable legislation300. Federal regulation
recognizes that, although CO2 is not a toxic gas, it remains managed under Schedule 1 of CEPA
1999. CO2 was added to Schedule 1 (List of toxic substances) in order to enable the Canadian
Government to have the use of a variety of preventive or control actions301. However, in 2013, a
Regulatory Working Group carried out an Alberta CCS Regulatory Framework Assessment (RFA),
concluding that CO2 is classified in the three main phases of a CCS project (a) during capture it can
be classified as a “harmful substance”, a “controlled product” or a “hazardous waste” (b) for the
transport phase, although there is no express classification, it is likely to come under the definition
of “gas” (c) regarding storage, the existing classification would be “specified gas”, if the
CO2 contained additional impurities it could be classified as “toxic302. In the US, the classification
of CO2 depends on the stage in the CCS project cycle. Moreover, state governments have legislative
power over certain aspects or stages of CCS activities (a) if the CO2 is transported by road or rail it
would be considered a Class 2.2 (non- flammable gas) hazardous material303; (b) transportation of
CO2 through pipelines would render it a hazardous-liquid (hazardous-liquid pipelines) 304; (c)
CO2 that is captured from emission sources and injected deep in Underground Injection Control
(UIC) Class VI305 wells for the sole purpose of long-term isolation from the atmosphere is
considered by the USEPA to be a waste306. Australia has not developed a uniform approach in
determining whether emitted and captured CO2 should be treated as a pollutant under pollution
legislation, or as a waste under waste legislation307.

Regarding the international best practices in model policies, the Global CCS Institute, in its CCS
Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago, stated that the latter did not have any laws specifically
classifying CO2 but the Environmental Management Act 2000 contained definitions for ‘air
pollutant’, ‘hazardous substance’, ‘pollutant’, ‘waste’ and ‘water pollutant’ which could all
potentially apply to CO2. The IEA CCS Legal and Regulatory Reviews which covered Indonesia,
stated that stored CO2 has not yet been clearly classified: it is considered either as an industrial

product, sometimes referred to as a resource, or as a waste product or pollutant. Finally, the
Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) publication on Carbon Geologic Storage
(2008) and related reports defines CO2 as “anthropogenically sourced CO2 of sufficient purity and
quality as not to compromise the safety and efficiency of the reservoir to effectively contain the
CO2”.

The legal classification of CO2 is important to determine the application of existing legal
requirements in a jurisdiction. As can be seen from the above review, a wide range of classifications
is used in each of the jurisdictions, resulting in important differences across countries. This is
mostly determined by local contextual considerations, such as whether existing legal frameworks
can be adapted to include CCS activities or whether a new framework needs to be developed. Such
considerations, as well as the appropriateness and flexibility of the existing legal requirements to
adequately cover CCUS activities, are essential when considering the classification of CO2.


 Gap 1
 There is no specific framework to categorize CO2 for the purpose of CCUS in Mexico. However,
 there are 4 legal categories from different regulations that can be useful to classify CO2 for CCUS
 projects; (i) as an air emission; (ii) as a waste; (iii) as a hazardous waste; and (iv) as a material (in
 which it can be included as a by-product or a commodity).

 Since there is no specific framework to categorize CO2 in Mexico and in accordance with the
 comparison with international practices, the lack of a specific classification for the use, handling,
 pipelines transportation and storage of CO2 is considered a gap in Mexico’s legal and regulatory
 framework since the only definitions of CO2 in Mexico today are as an air emission for capture
 purposes and as a material for rail and road transportation.

In order to be able to include punctual definitions of CO2 for use, pipeline transportation and storage
purposes and avoid misleading interpretation, current legislation would have to be modified or a
new piece of legislation would need to be developed. This implies obtaining the approval of the
Congress of Union for amendments to, or the development of, new laws or the approval of the
Executive branch of the Federal government for regulations and guidelines which can take a
considerable amount of time. In matters related to the hydrocarbon sector, the competent authority
has a legal basis to work on guidelines for the use of CO2 for EOR activities (use and storage
mainly) in the revised Hydrocarbons Law. However, at this point in time, there is no information
available on the progress of the preparation of such secondary legislation.

4.2   PROPERTY RIGHTS

Several issues related to property rights need to be clarified in relation to CCS prior to the start of
operations with a view to giving the necessary legal certainty to operators. Property rights regarding
CCUS in particular for the storage phase of CO2, is an issue that varies across jurisdictions and has
important implications on CCUS projects. As a general rule, in European countries minerals and
other subsurface formations and resources are publicly owned. A system of licensing exploration
and storage permits has therefore developed. However, those systems need to consider other rights,
such as the use of resources due to citizens’ property rights on the land or the public right to know
where pipelines or storage sites will be situated.

In addition, intellectual property (IP) law provides incentives for innovation and its dissemination
and commercialisation, by establishing enforceable property rights for the creators of new and
improved technology and processes. The balance between those rights, including the right to

                                                                                                       111
commercial confidentiality or to issue licenses for their use, and others such as the public right to
know, need to be reflected in national legislation to ensure public and investors’ confidence.

The IEA CCS Regulatory Framework Model establishes certain aspects regarding property rights
that should be considered including, ownership of captured and stored CO2, property rights over
surface infrastructure and access to infrastructure, property rights regarding subsurface/pore space
and intellectual property rights regarding the know-how and technology.

EU level legislation does not regulate property rights. Property rights are regulated at Member State
(national) level and some of them include provisions enabling expropriations to avoid future
claims308. Member States’ legislation needs to comply with the requirements of Directive 2003/4 on
public access to environmental information. However, in some Member States, it is not yet clear to
what extent information on applications will be made publicly available309. Property rights in
Canada have several levels of regulation; provincial and federal jurisdictions. The Mines and
Minerals Act and the Oil and Gas Conservation Act state that (a) regarding surface property, private
land requires an agreement between the lessee and the landowner, on public lands, a mineral surface
lease must be obtained from the government310 (b) in relation to subsurface property, the Mines and
Minerals Act vests all pore space in Alberta in the provincial Crown311, with the exception of
federal Crown land in Alberta, additional pore space tenure can only be granted at depths greater
than 1000 meters. Although in Saskatchewan the pore space associated with Crown minerals is
clearly vested in the Crown312, it is not clear if this right would extend to CO2 disposal projects or if
the pore space ownership would be vested in the surface owner or in the Crown. In the US, property
rights vary depending on state regulation and are not always clearly regulated. In case of
uncertainty, the state courts will have the last decision. Under existing precedent in many states, the
surface estate owner is generally viewed, not only as the owner of the surface land, but also the land
and strata overlying the severed mineral estate. Most importantly in the context of geological
sequestration, the majority view in the US provides that the subsurface pore space, where
CO2 would likely be stored, belongs to the surface owner313. Under Australia’s federal system of
government, the Australian (national) Government has jurisdiction extending from three nautical
miles offshore to the edge of Australia’s continental shelf (Commonwealth waters), while the State
and Territory Governments have jurisdiction onshore and in relation to coastal waters314. In
Victoria, the Crown owns all underground geological storage formations below the surface of any
lands, where the formation is deeper than 15-24 meters below the surface of the land315.

The Global CCS Institute, in its CCS Regulatory Review, found that (a) for the CCS Regulatory
Test Toolkit for Romania, the law needed to be amended to include CCS projects as a public utility
for expropriation purposes and the simplification of procedures for obtaining permits (b) as per
Trinidad and Tobago, different authorities have jurisdiction of specific aspects of land matters;
however, even if the land is privately held, the State has ownership over the subsurface and pore
space as well as oil and natural gas reserves, in most instances. The UCL Carbon Capture legal
programme states that there are differences in national regulation concerning property, but there are,

however, common concepts and questions arising in the context of CCS. These include, for
instance, the principle that while determining property interests at a storage site, it is essential to
acquire the necessary surface and subsurface rights. In addition, property rights for constructing the
pipeline infrastructure must be considered, as granting and transferring property rights has
implications on managing liability. Pore space ownership with regard to storage in depleted
hydrocarbon reservoirs must also be considered.

In Mexico, property rights can be divided between i) superficial rights and ii) subsoil property.
Superficial property is also categorized as: a) private property, belonging to any private legal entity;
b) public property, belonging to the Mexican government in any of the three levels; and c)
communal lands and ejido lands, as regulated by Mexican Agrarian Law, (Ley Agraria). The
subsoil is considered to be the property of the Mexican State, especially regarding any minerals,
hydrocarbons, radioactive elements and underground aquifers. However, there is no particular
regulation of pore space under Mexican law, nor a clear distinction of where surface property ends
in relation to subsurface property.

There is no impact, or additional impact, to EOR operations derived from the entrance of different
operators in addition to Pemex since the Energy Reform. All users or operators, including Pemex,
need to have a contract for carrying out activities that are related to hydrocarbons and will need to
obtain the authorization from the owner of the superficial land for using such land for EOR
activities. The only addition in the new energy legislation is the process of obtaining a right of way
for hydrocarbons in case no agreement is reached with the owner of the superficial land.

 Gap 2
 From the analysis of current legislation in Mexico related to property rights, we find that
 superficial property is regulated. However, there is a gap in regard to the use of pore space
 relating to subsurface property. Even though the Mexican Constitution states that from the origin
 all property belongs to the Nation, only the extraction of minerals, hydrocarbons, radioactive
 elements and underground aquifers is specifically regulated, but the property of pore space such
 as geological formations for capture and storage purposes is not. Likewise, there are no
 limitations that clarify how much of the subsurface is considered part of the superficial property
 (i.e. for the use of foundations of infrastructure or basements of any construction) and how much
 is considered under federal jurisdiction for the use of which a specific authorization will be
 needed.

 Additionally, since the energy reform all energy related activities have a preferential right for the
 use of the land. Hence, only for EOR activities and storage related matters, as well as for the
 capture of CO2 generated in the generation and transport of electric energy, there are specific
 provisions related to preferential rights that regulate the use of the superficial land316.

In order to resolve the aforementioned gaps, an amendment to the Federal Constitution would be
needed. This implies that the Congress of Union needs to vote in favour of authorizing such
amendments along with the majority of the state congresses. This can be considered as a barrier to
the deployment of CCUS activities. A vote on constitutional amendments will depend on many
factors, not exclusively related to CCUS, such as political agreements and relevant matters to be
voted in that specific parliamentary session and elections. This could create a risk for the
obtainment of a positive authorization as well as for the timing for passing such amendments.


316
   The Hydrocarbons Law and Electric Energy Law establish a legal procedure for obtaining the use of the superficial
land in case no agreement with the owner is reached.

                                                                                                                113
Likewise, there will be a need for other amendments to the general laws, such as the National
Assets Law, which will also require a vote from the Congress of Union. In this particular matter we
consider that all modifications need to be enshrined in laws and not in regulations or guidelines.
However, both options may take a considerable amount of time.

Finally, there are some restrictions for the use of the surface and subsurface of the land related to
the type of vegetation in the surface (such as mangroves since these cannot be removed) and the
location of the property, due to the environmental services that it provides to the ecosystem, such as
Natural Protected Areas and restrictions on the ecological ordinance programs. Such restrictions are
also applicable for CCUS and EOR activities and can also, in principle, be considered as barriers.
Notwithstanding the existence of such restrictions, these are equally present in the majority of the
international practices reviewed as part of this study.

4.3    COMPETITION WITH OTHER USERS AND PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS ISSUES

When an extensive survey under a CO2 storage site exploration authorization has been carried out,
in order to incentivize CCUS, preferential rights should be given to that operator to apply for
authorization to develop the site and to store CO2, subject to time limits. Furthermore, providing for
conflict resolution in the event that disputes arise in authorizing sub-surface activities, the IEA also
recommends considering ways for clarifying interaction with the CO2 injected formations with
regard to existing authorizations relating to other uses of the sub-surface.

The IEA CCS Regulatory Framework Model considers the following issues should be addressed:
     existing authorizations relating to other uses of the sub-surface and the clarification
       regarding coexistence;
     preferential development rights to operators who undertook an extensive survey under a
       CO2 storage site exploration; and
     provide for conflict resolution in the event that disputes arise in authorising sub-surface
       activities.

In the EU, the holder of an exploration permit must have the sole right to explore the potential of a
CO2 storage complex and no conflicting uses of the complex are permitted during the period of
validity of the exploration permit317. Priority for the granting of a storage permit for a site must be
given to the holder of the exploration permit for that site and no conflicting uses of the storage
complex are allowed during the storage permit procedure. The Carbon Sequestration Tenure
Regulation of Canada does not provide the permit holder or the lessee with the exclusive right to
evaluate and test (including drilling) or an exclusive right to inject captured CO2 within the area of
the permit or lease. Neither does a permit holder receive a preferential right to acquire a lease out of
the area in which it holds a permit318. Furthermore, the Oil and Gas Conservation Act requires a
project proponent to demonstrate that a CO2 sequestration project will not interfere with the
recovery, conservation, or storage of oil or gas319. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the
US does not currently have a statutory or regulatory mechanism that directly addresses the
assurances sought by current applicants for a non-competitive preference right to develop future
CCS projects after initial site characterization studies320. Considering that the Australian CCS legal

framework was designed to prevent competition between CCS projects and petroleum industries,
the Australian Government’s Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGS
Act) provides for petroleum and CO2 storage operations to coexist, though there are constraints. In
particular, the Responsible Commonwealth Minister (RCM) must be satisfied that CO2 injection
will not have a “significant risk of a significant adverse impact” o n pre-existing petroleum titles or
operations321.

Regarding the international best practices in model policies, the Global CCS Institute, CCS
Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago, explains that if a Ministry gets a specific CCS
mandate, the Commissioner of State Lands has the power to give vested land to the Ministry.
Should that land already be leased by a State agency or operator, the land can be de-reserved and
provided to the Ministry, with compensation given to the previous leaseholder.

Mexican legislation does not explicitly regulate preferential rights for CCUS activities. However, if
such projects involve EOR or any other hydrocarbon or electricity facilities, they can be subject to
preferential rights under the Hydrocarbons Law and Electric Industry Law. Any project related to
the exploration, production, distribution and transportation of hydrocarbons has preferential rights
over any other project, including mining projects. Additionally, careful consideration must be given
to preferential rights of indigenous peoples and communities regarding the use of the natural
resources in their territories according to article 2° of the Mexican Constitution. In this regard, the
Mexican Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación) has the competence to
issue the necessary criteria to solve conflicts of preferential rights as they may arise.

 Gap 3
 Since there is no specific legislation in Mexico related to CCUS activities on preferential rights’
 matters, there is a gap in knowing if such activities will have a preferential right over any other
 activity, with the exception of activities related to hydrocarbons and the electric industry and
 geothermal activity, such as EOR activities, and a right over carbon-gas deposits on mining
 projects. Additionally, after energy activities, mining activities have a preferential right over other
 activities so that only CCUS activities that have a relation with mining will be preferential over
 other uses. Last but not least, there is existing legislation that enlists all activities considered as a
 public utility that may have preferential rights for expropriation. In case the specific CCUS
 activity to be carried out can be included in one of the activities enlisted, then it may have a
 preferential right over any other activities. Notwithstanding, such legislation is not clear and will
 need clarification in order to avoid any type of risk derived from legal interpretation.

In order to regulate any preferential right for specific CCUS activities other than EOR and storage,
an amendment to the current legislation will be needed. This can be considered as a barrier due to
the legal procedures that need to be followed and the risk of not reaching agreement on such
amendments (this could be due to several reasons, such as the need to obtain political agreement). It
is expected that such procedures may take a considerable amount of time.

4.4    COMPOSITION OF THE CO2 STREAM

Regulating the composition of the CO2 stream is important as some streams of captured CO2 may
contain impurities which could have environmental or health impacts. The IEA CCS Regulatory
Framework Model considers the need for a case-by-case assessment of the risks posed by certain

                                                                                                                  115
impurities, including the following issues:
    concentration of impurities
    mass flow of impurities
    addition of other matter for the purpose of waste disposal
    potential impacts of impurities

In the EU, a CO2 stream must consist overwhelmingly of carbon dioxide. To this end, no waste or
other matter may be added for the purpose of disposing of that waste or other matter. However, a
CO2 stream may contain incidental associated substances from the source, capture or injection
process and trace substances added to assist in monitoring and verifying CO2 migration. The EU
requirements for the composition of the CO2 stream are phrased in a rather general manner; while
the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (Victoria) the Commission is
requested to adopt, if appropriate, guides on the conditions applicable for respecting the criteria of
CO2 Stream, it leaves a certain margin of discretion for Member States in determining detailed
regulations to ensure that the operator complies with the requirements concerning the composition
of the stream. In Canada there are no industry-wide standards or limits on the level of impurities in
CO2 streams in CCS projects322. CO2 stream is defined under the Code of Federal Regulations of the
US as the carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source, plus incidental associated
substances derived from the source materials and the capture process, and any substances added to
the stream to enable or improve the injection process. This definition does not apply to any carbon
dioxide stream that meets the definition of a hazardous waste. The term “CCS stream” is used in the
Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources (MCMPR) Regulatory Guiding Principles
and is defined as follows: “A gas or liquid/fluid, consisting predominately of carbon dioxide, which
is to be injected into a geological formation for the purpose of avoiding the release of that carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere”. Such a stream may contain other substances depending on both the
source from which the carbon dioxide is being drawn as well as the capture, separation, injection
and monitoring processes used323. The Victoria Greenhouse Geological Sequestration Act 2008
(GGGS Act) requires CO2 streams for injection to be either pure or consist “overwhelmingly” of
CO2. CO2 streams may, however, also contain incidental related substances and detection agents,
provided that, where the CO2 stream contains a prescribed detection agent, the concentration of that
agent does not exceed prescribed levels324. The GGGS Act also applies to greenhouse gases other
than CO2 that may be considered for injection and storage. The OPGGS Act contains an identical
definition. The OPGGS Act defines a greenhouse gas substance as a gas substance other than
CO2 that may be considered for injection and storage. It is an offence to add waste or other matter to
a greenhouse gas substance for injection into the offshore area seabed or subsoil for disposal
purposes325.

General rules with regard to CCUS projects and the composition of CO2 steams are still lacking in
Mexico. In the case that CO2 were to be mixed with a hazardous waste, the mixture would be
considered and treated as a hazardous waste and would be subject to regulations that allow
hazardous wastes to be injected in the subsoil as part of waste confinement in stable geological
formations. Apart from this, there is no other regulation of the composition of CO2 streams for
injection.

 Gap 4
 There is a gap in relation to the regulation of the composition of the CO2 stream in Mexico since
 there is no legal framework that establishes the quantity of CO2 to be considered in the stream.
 The only existing requirements that could apply are those for hazardous wastes, in the case where
 CO2 is mixed with any other substance that can be considered as hazardous waste for the
 injection. The mixture of both substances will in that case be considered as hazardous waste and
 will need to be integrally managed as a hazardous waste, including its storage into a geological
 formation for final disposal.

In order to provide specific requirements for the composition of the CO2 stream for injection, the
executive branch of the government will need to amend existing regulations and create new
guidelines or the Congress of the Union will need to vote in favour of the amendment of existing
laws or the creation of new ones. In the case where CO2 is mixed with hazardous waste for the
purpose of injection, explicit requirements on the composition of the CO2 stream to be considered
CCS would be necessary in line with the requirements in some EU Member States to ensure the
injection of hazardous waste is limited to incidental presence in the CO2 stream.

Additionally, for EOR, regulatory provisions on the composition of the CO2 stream would need to
be created as provided for in the ASEA Act. This will not require any voting from the Congress of
Union since the competence of ASEA for regulating such activities is clearly stated in the ASEA
Act.

4.5    ENGAGING THE PUBLIC IN DECISION MAKING

One of the key problems facing CCS development is the public acceptance of the projects. It is
generally acknowledged that public acceptance is improved when information is made publicly
available and there is a process in place to ensure that the public can be involved in the decision
making process.

The IEA CCS Regulatory Framework Model considers that the engagement of the public
stakeholders in the regulatory process for CCS projects can be vital in ensuring a project can
proceed. In particular, providing the public with information on associated risks (and the measures
taken to manage these) and benefits is a crucial element to ensuring public acceptance of the
project. Furthermore, the model states that countries already regulate public consultation procedures
in the context of planning law frameworks and the EIA process. Drawing on such existing processes
is recommended.

In the EU, EIA Directive 2011/92/EU (amended in 2014), states that the public concerned must be
given early and effective opportunities to participate in the decision making procedures when an
environmental impact assessment is required for a given project326. Indeed, according to the EIA
Directive 2011/92/EU327, the transport of carbon dioxide streams for the purposes of geological
storage, including associated booster stations, the storage sites pursuant to the CCS Directive and
the installations for the capture of CO2 streams for the purposes of geological storage are subject to
an assessment of its impacts on the environment, involving a public participation procedure.
Furthermore, the general public has the right to be informed about certain issues, such as the request
for a permit, the competent authorities or the draft decision. For the purpose of public participation,
the public concerned must be entitled to express comments and opinions, before the decision on the

326
    Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the
effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.
327
    Article 4(1) of EIA Directive.

                                                                                                               117
request for a permit is taken. The results of the public information and participation must be
examined and taken into consideration by the permitting authority when issuing a permit. The
public concerned also has the right to challenge a decision on a permit taken by the competent
authority. Currently in Canada, there are no public consultation and notification requirements
designed specifically for CCS. Therefore, the public participation requirements applied are those of
the oil and gas regulatory framework of which the principal objective is to inform local stakeholders
and address concerns328. The Alberta Energy Regulator directives provide participation
requirements that must be considered for an application for an energy-related development project
and throughout the life of that development. These include situations where a consultation is
required, the obligation of the developer to address all questions, objections and concerns regarding
the proposed development and attempt to resolve them and confirmation that stakeholders do not
have objections to the project. Administrative procedure codes for most US states, and certainly for
the Federal government, contain mechanisms by which stakeholders can mount a legal challenge to
state action with respect to the licensing or permitting of major projects, which might include
judicial review329. Additionally, CCS operators would need to obtain approval from tribal leaders in
addition to the USEPA prior to injecting CO2 on tribal lands. Existing Australian CCS legislation
provides extensive stakeholder engagement mechanisms in respect of pipeline license applications,
although the focus of pipelines’ legislation is on providing for consultations to manage competing
uses of pipeline land330. The GGGS Act provides for community consultation on the environmental
impacts of the injection testing plans; the injection and monitoring plan331; in case of unit
development if part of underground geological storage formation interstate; and in case of
community consultation by the authority332. Additionally, Australian law provides protections to
native title holders and claimants where a government proposes taking certain actions which
typically require that certain procedural steps, such as notification and consultation, be observed
prior to the action being done.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies: (i) The Global CCS Institute: CCS
Regulatory Review states the following (a) CCS Regulatory Test Toolkit for Scotland presents a
wide range of organizations that have legitimate interest in CCS and the regulatory processes that
approve the project, furthermore it provides a stakeholder map that should be used to create a
stakeholder engagement plan (b) CCS Regulatory Test Toolkit for Romania provides that project
delays are often caused by public acceptance, consequently a strong public engagement is
emphasised (c) The CCS Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago states that for the EIA
process consultation mechanisms are in place; (ii) The IOGCC publication on Carbon Geologic
Storage (2008) and related reports recommends that states and provinces solicit public involvement
in the process, to educate the public on the facts and on the non pollutant/hazardous effects of CCS.
The opinion of local communities located near an infrastructure project is of the utmost importance
according to several regulations, even if CCUS activities are not directly referred to. Mexican law
includes four different mechanisms for engaging the public in decision making:
      as part of the EIA process there are two consultations, a community consultation and an
         expert consultation
      before the construction of any upstream, downstream or midstream hydrocarbon project, it
         is necessary to perform a Social Impact Assessment in order to protect the interest of local

          no agrarian land can be sold without the authorization of the general assembly (asamblea
           ejidal) or the equivalent authority for communal lands
          the ILO Convention 169, states that prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples and
           original inhabitants is compulsory. However, it is important to note that ILO 169 specifies,
           at several instances, that its provisions and principles apply ‘within a context of
           compatibility with the national legal system’.

In Mexico, the Constitution requires, in its Article 2° that careful consideration must be given to
preferential rights of indigenous peoples and communities regarding the use of its natural resources
in their territories. In this regard, the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia
de la Nación) or a federal judge has the competence to issue the necessary criteria to solve conflicts
of preferential rights as they may arise.


 Gap 5
 In relation to public and/or social consultation, Mexico has several obligations that apply to
 CCUS activities such as: (i) the social and experts consultation procedures as part of the
 environmental impact evaluation for any project considered under Federal Jurisdiction; (ii) the
 Social Impact Assessment for any project related with hydrocarbons such as EOR activities; and
 (iii) in case the project would be installed within agrarian land (mainly common use land333), the
 authorization from the Ejido Assembly could be considered as a community consultation.
 However, in case CCUS activities are not included in any of the aforementioned cases, there is a
 gap in the current legislation on a federal and local level since no public or social consultation is
 needed. Even though Mexico is part of an International Treaty (ILO Convention 169), this Treaty
 only obliges the Mexican State, but not the persons, due to the fact that such obligation has not
 been included in any legislation with the exception of the Hydrocarbons Act.

In order to amend all current legislation to include social or public consultation as an obligation or
condition for the installation of any infrastructure project, including CCUS activities and also to
avoid misleading interpretations, an initiative or request before the Congress of Union will be
needed. This can be considered a barrier as such a procedure may be considered risky since it
usually depends on political agreements and can also be time consuming. Likewise, for all activities
considered under local jurisdiction, local legislation shall also be amended. In this case, the
modifications of the existing local law will have to be requested in each of the legislative bodies in
each State in Mexico, which may take a considerable amount of time.

4.6       SCOPE OF FRAMEWORK AND PROHIBITIONS

The scope of a regulatory framework for CCS depends largely on the type of CCS projects the
regulatory agency wishes to allow in its territory, as well as the compatibility with other legislation.
To avoid confusion, it is important to clearly establish the scope of the applicable regulations, for
each of the separate activities in the CCS chain.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the IEA Legal and Regulatory
Reviews state that the UNCLOS (1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) party
countries, may only carry out the geological storage of CO2 within the whole of the national
territory, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf. Furthermore, the German CCS

333
   Common use land is defined under the Agrarian Law as the land which is owned by the ejido community that has not
been subdivided and for its use needs the consent of all ejido or community members by means of an Ejido Assembly.

                                                                                                               119
Law contains a “state clause” allowing the states to define certain areas of their territory in which
CO2 storage is allowed or forbidden, provided that the definition is based on reasonable grounds.
The section on the scope of the legal and regulatory framework for CCS refers to the geographical
scope, as well as processes or activities not covered by it or prohibitions. The CCS Directive in the
EU applies to the geological storage of CO2 in the territory of the Member States, their exclusive
economic zones and on their continental shelves within the meaning of the UNCLOS. Specific
aspects concerning CO2 capture and storage are covered by other pieces of EU legislation. The CCS
Directive does not apply to the geological storage of CO2, with a total intended storage below 100
kilo tonnes, undertaken for research, development or testing of new products and processes. The
storage of CO2 in the water column is not to be permitted. Federal prohibitions in Canada include
regulation regarding fauna and flora impacts arising from the transport of CO2. However, in practice
the Federal Government has little jurisdiction over the possible impacts of CCS upon fauna and
flora which is left to the provincial natural resources ministries334. Alberta prohibitions include a
framework for the protection of non-saline groundwater and prohibit the release of a substance in an
amount that may cause a significant adverse effect. Furthermore, certain pieces of legislation
explicitly mandate that CCS projects shall not interfere with or negatively impact hydrocarbon
projects in the province335.

The limitations and prohibitions for CCS projects in the US include:
    oil and gas pipelines which have a public convenience and necessity qualification which
        grants them eminent domain336;
    offshore exploration can only be undertaken to the extent that the activity is not “unduly
        harmful to aquatic life in the area” 337;
    CCS activities must not jeopardize any threatened or endangered species or harm any
        critical habitat338;
    although not currently in place, injection wells up to three miles offshore could become
        subject to regulation under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act
        (MPRSA);
    sequestration would limit all possibility of extracting minerals from the same formation,
        therefore when exploring potential sequestration sites, title searches and investigation as to
        ownership of mineral estates in the exploration area would be necessary339;
    Indian tribes may issue rights-of-way for pipelines (not to exceed thirty years) on tribal
        lands without specific approval by the Secretary of the Interior340.

Offshore conflicts in Australia could include issues with other users, such as fisheries, shipping
routes, infrastructure and, in particular, the oil industry. As such the Australian government has
adopted a range of onshore and offshore specific policy and regulatory responses to address storage
management, which provides for clear security of title for CO2 operators and also clarifies long term
liability issues341.

In Mexico, CCUS projects are not subject to any specified prohibitions. Furthermore, under waste

laws in Mexico, contrary to some of the other jurisdictions reviewed as part of this study, waste can
be injected in the underground. The legal framework is distributed in different acts and regulations.
However, CCUS projects will be subject to the environmental prohibitions as well as international
prohibitions related to sites deemed as sacred or world heritage sites implemented for any
infrastructure project, such as projects in protected natural areas and other reserves. Additionally,
any other infrastructure project will have to follow Federal, State and local prohibitions related with
ecological ordinance, land-use programs and urban development programs in order to obtain the
required environmental permits.

 Gap 6
 There are no specific or direct prohibitions to the establishment and operation of CCUS activities
 in Mexico with the exception of environmental prohibitions applicable to all types of
 infrastructure projects (such as restrictions in Natural Protected Areas and on Ecological
 Ordinance Programs) as well as international prohibitions related to sites deemed as sacred or
 world heritage sites. Likewise, on a local and municipal level, there are some restrictions to all
 types of projects related to the use of the land which are regulated by means of Urban
 Development Programs. However, apart from the aforementioned, there is no other restriction for
 CCUS activities in Mexico.

 Such regulations and prohibitions are applicable only to specific and determined areas and there
 might be certain areas that are viable for carrying out CCUS activities that are not subject to such
 prohibitions and regulations (and may render an environmental service). In case CCUS activities
 may have an environmental impact and such impact has not been regulated by means of an
 Environmental Impact Authorization, and there is no specific restriction for the area where the
 CCUS activities will be established, then some amendments to the current legislation need to be
 carried out in order to regulate and minimize the possible environmental impact generated. This
 applies even more if such area renders environmental services. Additional legislation and
 regulations should be created to cover environmental aspects of such areas.

To resolve this gap, amendment to several pieces of legislation, or the creation of a new instrument,
will be needed which will require authorization from the Congress of Union. This process might be
affected by potential complications associated with obtaining such authorization as it depends on
several factors, such as political agreements and election times, which may take a considerable
amount of time.

In case CCUS activities can create an environmental impact and such impact has not been regulated
by means of an Environmental Impact Authorization, and there are no specific restrictions for the
area where the CCUS activities will be established, then some amendments to the current legislation
need to be carried out in order to regulate and minimize the possible environmental impact to be
generated, especially if such area renders environmental services, for it can be considered as an area
of importance on environmental matters.

4.7   DEFINITION OF “CCS READY”

The definition of “CCS Ready” is necessary in the situation where the CCS legislation does not
require operators to use CCS but to ‘be ready to apply CCS’ when the technology is matured and its
commercial feasibility is demonstrated.

The IEA CCS model Regulatory Framework states that new plants should be built in such a way as
to enable CCS to be subsequently fitted. This prevents these plants from being “locked -in” and
unable to use CCS when the necessary regulatory and economic drivers are put in place. This

                                                                                                   121
precaution is known as CCS ready (CCSR). The Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the
context of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme post-2012, consider that CCS-
ready plants are new power plants that are ready for the environmentally safe capture and
geological storage of CO2. Its Annex I includes the only definition of CCS-ready in EU legislation:
‘CCS-ready’ means that an installation has demonstrated that suitable storage sites are a vailable,
that transport facilities are technically and economically feasible and that it is technically and
economically feasible to retrofit for CO2 capture, as soon as sufficient market incentives in the form
of a CO2 price threshold are reached. In particular, CCS-ready requires:

     demonstration of the technical feasibility of retrofitting for CO2 capture. A site-specific
      technical study should be produced showing, in sufficient engineering detail, that the facility is
      technically capable of being fully retrofitted for CO2 capture at a capture rate of 85 % or higher,
      using one or more types of technology which are proven at pre- commercial scale or whose
      performance can be reliably estimated as being suitable;

     control of sufficient additional space on the site on which capture equipment is to be installed;

     identification of one or more technically and economically feasible pipeline or other transport
      route(s) to the safe geological storage of CO2;

     identification of one or more potential storage sites which have been assessed as suitable for the
      safe geological storage of projected full lifetime volumes and rates of captured CO2;

     demonstration of the economic feasibility of retrofitting an integrated CCS system to the
      full/partial capacity of the facility, based on an economic assessment. The assessment should
      provide evidence of reasonable scenarios, taking into account CO2 prices’ forecasts, the costs of
      the technologies and storage options identified in the technical studies, their margins of error
      and the projected operating revenues. The assessment will indicate the circumstances under
      which CCS would be economically feasible during the lifetime of the proposed installation. It
      should also include a potential CCS implementation plan, including a potential timetable to
      entry into operation; and

     demonstration that all relevant permits to implement CCS can be obtained and identification of
      procedures and timelines for this process.

The CCS Directive, amending the IPPC Directive, established for the first time the legal
requirements for operators of combustion plants with a rated electrical output of 300 megawatts or
more for which the original construction license or, in the absence of such a procedure, the original
operating license is granted after the entry into force of the CCS Directive. The operator must assess
whether suitable sites are available, transport facilities are technically and economically feasible
and whether it is technically and economically feasible to retrofit for CO 2 capture. If the conditions
are met, the operator is required to ensure that suitable space is set aside on the installation site for
the equipment necessary to capture and compress CO2. In Canada there is no definition of CCS
Ready. However, the Guidance on Air Emissions and Monitoring Requirements during Combustion
of Non-Gaseous Fuels gives an interim definition of CO2 capture adapted from the International
Energy Agency (2007) and ICF International (2010) for the Emission Guidelines for the Use of
Non-gaseous Fossil Fuels342. In the US there is no definition of CCS Ready. However, the Best
Available Control Technology (BACT) mechanism under the Clean Air Act (administered by the

combustion of non-gaseous fuels.

                                                                                                         122
EPA) could potentially act as a de-facto CCS ready policy. In Australia (and Victoria) there is no
definition of CCS Ready.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies: (i) the IEA CCS Legal and Regulatory
Reviews state that in the United Kingdom, the National Policy Statements for Energy (NPSs)
established that all commercial scale (at or over 300MW) combustion power stations have to be
constructed Carbon Capture Ready; and (ii) the UCL Carbon Capture Legal Programme provides
that CCSR is a policy option that can ensure new facilities are designed, approved and constructed
in a manner that enables a retrofit of CCS technologies at an appropriate future time, whilst helping
to avoid carbon lock-in and reduce future cost of CCS retrofits.

 Gap 7
 In Mexico there is no definition for ´CCS Ready´ in any applicable legislation. However, the
 critical route map issued by the Ministry of Energy includes CCS Ready as a policy to implement
 for 2016.

In case it is considered appropriate to require permits for new industrial plants to be CCS ready,
amendments to law and regulations will be needed. This shall require, in some cases, the
authorization from the Congress of Union or Legislative branches of each State and, for
modifications of regulations or creation of guidelines, from the Executive branches on a Federal or
local level if needed. Such a procedure can be considered as a barrier since it may depend on
several external factors such as political agreements and election times, which may be time
consuming.

4.8    INCENTIVES FOR CCS AS PART OF THE CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES

CCS is not a fully mature technology and requires incentives for the development of its commercial
deployment. In addition, it is a cost for an operator with the aim to reduce emissions and generating
a reduction in the general plant efficiency. The mitigation objective of this technology justifies the
adoption of financial and economic incentives to strengthen the take up of this new technology and
provide certainty for investors. The adoption of incentives needs to be linked to specific climate
mitigation strategies requiring the reduction of CO2 emissions.

The IEA Legal and Regulatory Reviews provide the following types of incentive frameworks that
might be considered to promote CCS deployment at large CO2 emitting point source installations:
     carbon taxes imposed to CO2 emission to the atmosphere;
     cap-and-trade based emission trading;
     emission reduction credits to be traded in the carbon market;
     feed-in tariffs and product-based incentives;
     emission performance standards; and
     technology mandates.

In addition, another International Best Practice Model Policy, the UCL Carbon Capture Legal
Programme, provides similar incentive options to enact (a) emissions’ trading scheme (b) carbon
tax (c) governmental aid and (d) external funding.

In the EU, the ETS Directive 2003/87/EC requires the reduction of emissions to a specific emission
cap343. The reduction of emissions through CO2 being captured, transported and stored in
343
   Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for
greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.

                                                                                                              123
accordance with the CCS Directive are covered by the emissions’ trading scheme. The ETS
includes an incentive under article 10 requiring that for Member States at least 50 % of the revenues
generated from the auctioning of allowances are used for the environmentally safe capture and
geological storage of CO2. Further Article 10a(8) refers to the 300 million allowances in the new
entrants' reserve that shall be available until 31 December 2015 to help stimulate the construction
and operation of up to 12 commercial demonstration projects that aim at the environmentally safe
capture and geological storage (CCS) of CO2 in the territory of the Union. Under the Specified Gas
Emitters Regulation (SGER) of Canada, the use of offset credits is one of four compliance options
available to regulate facilities344 to reduce emissions’ intensity345. Specific incentives for CCS have
not been established in the US. However, clean coal investment tax credits were authorized
alongside new research spending and other financial incentives. In Australia, the Carbon Capture
and Storage Fund (CCSF) was established under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility
(CEFPF) fund to support the deployment of CCS demonstration projects in Asia346.

Mexican Income Tax Law includes certain dispositions related with the mitigation of pollutant
emissions. These regulations include tax benefits for the development of new technologies and the
acquisition of new machinery. The trade of Carbon Credits inside the Mexican market is a voluntary
mechanism to promote the mitigation of greenhouse gases, although its implementation in Mexico
is at an initial stage. The Special Tax on Production and Services, or IEPS, is a new tax imposed on
certain activities, such as hydrocarbons’ production. This tax can be paid using Carbon Credits,
provided that the hydrocarbons’ production is developed in Mexico and the Carbon Credits are
certified according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Additionally, machinery and technology importation are other ways to make use of tax and
financial incentives in order to benefit CCUS projects. Normally machinery import is subject to
certain duties which, in the case of CCUS projects, is considered state of the art technology with the
only purpose of improving the environment, and will not be charged.

Gap 8
Although there are several activities in Mexico that are incentivized and in which CCUS activities
can be categorized (i.e. 35% deduction of the price of new machinery for reducing pollutant
emissions, trading of energy certificates for mitigating costs in the generation of clean energy),
most of these are for the capture of carbon dioxide as an air emission. There is no specific
incentive for other CCUS activities since these are not defined and regulated in Mexico. This can
be considered as a gap, specifically regarding activities related to the transport and storage of CO2.

Likewise, in relation to carbon credit markets, there is a specific regulation to create a National
carbon market in which CCUS projects will have benefits for the trade of carbon credits. Similarly,
there are international markets that could allow CCUS activities to have additional incentives as
part of climate mitigation activities. However, such a market is not well defined and is not fully
operational at this point.

Finally, Mexico does not currently have a mandatory emission reduction target or mandatory
emission limitations for CO2 or greenhouse gases for certain high-emitting sectors. As such, there
is no clear incentive for CCUS activities, which can also be considered as a gap. As long as there

344
    The other ways are: meeting its efficiency targets, paying the $15 per tonne levy to the Climate Change and Emissions
Management Fund, and applying emissions performance credits (EPCs) (generated by a regulated facility that beats its
own target).

is no cap on emissions for these sectors, the incentive to implement CCUS activities is low.

In case there is a decision to create specific incentives for CCUS activities, some amendments to the
applicable legislation need to be performed. This may be considered as a barrier to the deployment
of CCUS activities since, in Mexico, the modifications to a law depend on many external factors,
such as political agendas and agreements. Moreover, they may take a considerable amount of time.
In addition, guidelines need to be created in accordance with the General Law on Climate Change
in order to create a mandatory emission reduction target for the activities in Mexico that will
incentivize the implementation of CCUS activities involving the capture of CO2.

Finally, until the carbon credit market in Mexico starts operating fully, there might be an additional
barrier to the deployment of CCUS activities.

4.9   AUTHORIZATION FOR CAPTURE

Various methods of capture may be employed as part of CCS activities. All of these require the
installation of new equipment and additional technical processes to be undertaken at the designated
capture site. As such, the explicit inclusion of CO2 capture in the existing regulatory frameworks
with a view to providing a clear regulatory framework for CO2 capture and any necessary additional
requirements, for instance in relation to monitoring, may be necessary.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework provides that the capture of CO2 requires the
installation of new equipment and additional technical processes at the designated capture site.
Subsequently, new permits or authorisations will be needed to build and operate capture plants.
Amendments to the laws that govern the operation of these installations may also be necessary.

In the EU, the authorisation process for CO2 capture is mainly regulated by the provisions of the
IED and the EIA Directive. The IED provides that Member States must take the necessary measures
to ensure that no installation or combustion plant, waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration
plant, is operated without a permit and the permit procedure meets the requirements set out in the
IED. Before the permit for a CO2 capture installation is granted, the permitting authority must take
into account the results of the public consultation and environmental impact assessment.
Furthermore, the permit must include all necessary measures to ensure that:
      all the appropriate preventive measures are taken against pollution and that no significant
          pollution is caused;
      the best available techniques are applied (where an environmental quality standard requires
          stricter conditions than those achievable by the use of the best available techniques,
          additional measures must be included in the permit);
      the necessary measures are taken to prevent accidents and limit their consequences;
      the necessary measures are taken upon definitive cessation of activities to avoid any risk of
          pollution and return the site of operation to a satisfactory state, taking into consideration
          the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination at the site of the installation.

Considering that in Canada federal jurisdiction classifies as a toxic gas, it should be managed
similarly to other airborne emissions. Nevertheless, Alberta Province has classified CO2 as a
“harmful substance,” “controlled product” and “hazardous waste”, which would imply that for the
capture stage the mechanisms put in place by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
should regulate CCS activities347. In the US, a national regulatory system applicable explicitly to

CO2 capture has not yet been established348. However, to the extent that a CCS project triggers
permit obligations under other environmental laws, the permitting agency could be required to
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. Furthermore, retrofitting an existing power plant with
CCS technology could also trigger New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the Clean Air
Act (CAA). CO2 capture in Australia is, in general terms, governed by State planning and
environment laws. These regimes generally require that development of land is consistent with
local, regional and/or state-level environmental planning instruments (EPIs). In addition,
developments which impact on matters of national environmental significance may be subject to
Federal regulation349. CO2 capture obligations could be included in planning consents. Furthermore,
a VEPA license is required for all scheduled premises, unless the premises are exempted in the
Environment Protection (Scheduled Premises and Exemptions) Regulations 2007350.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, The Global CCS institute Regulatory
Test Toolkit for Romania provides that the permitting for capture is governed by the environmental
impact authorization process and the operational licenses.

There is no specific authorization for carbon capture in Mexico, but there are instruments for
monitoring and controlling atmospheric emissions in Mexico. Although it is not a license
specifically designed for CCUS projects, the Sole Environmental License is required for all
industrial facilities enlisted as federal stationary sources of air emissions.

Since CO2 is considered as an air emission in Mexico, there are several provisions for capturing
CO2 in order to avoid surpassing maximum permissible levels of contaminants into the atmosphere.
For such matters, a license must be obtained and controlled methods for reducing emissions must be
installed that can be considered as part of the capturing procedure. However, the current regulations
are not created specifically for the capture of CO2, but for regulating all air emissions generated by
Federal and Local stationary sources, for which CO2 can be considered.

 Gap 9
 Since the Energy Reform, ASEA has the mandate to create guidelines related to the capturing of
 CO2 in activities related with the hydrocarbon sector. The Hydrocarbons Law and the ASEA Law
 state that ASEA has the authority to regulate the generation, capture, transportation and storage of
 CO2, if it is related to hydrocarbons. To date, such guidelines have not been issued. This can be
 considered as a gap.

In order to resolve the aforementioned gaps, some amendments to the current legislation must be
performed and in some cases new legislation must be created. Moreover, the guidelines by ASEA
regulating CCUS activities for the hydrocarbons’ sector, i.e. for EOR activities, will need to be
adopted.

4.10 MONITORING REPORTING AND VERIFICATION                                     REQUIREMENTS            OF     CO2
     EMISSIONS RELATED TO CAPTURE INSTALLATIONS

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework mentions that monitoring is crucial for the incentive
scheme operator to gain assurance over the effectiveness of a particular project to reduce CO2
emissions over the long term, therefore monitoring and reporting activities for CCS projects must
be carried out. Additionally, the monitoring reports will provide the basis for ex-post awards of, or
adjustments to, credits or payments linked to emissions’ reductions achieved by a project.

In the EU, a permit granted for an installation (including CO2 capture installations) must include
emission monitoring requirements which should specify measurement methodology, frequency and
evaluation procedure. Results of this monitoring must be submitted to the competent authority at
least annually. The permit should also include requirements for the regular maintenance and
surveillance of measures taken to prevent emissions to soil and groundwater. Reporting of pollutant
emissions in the Province of Alberta is regulated in individual operating approvals and by the
province's Air Monitoring Directive. Industry is required to submit monitoring reports to the
ESRD351. Reporting requirements are specified in approvals and vary depending on the substance,
size and nature of the facility. The reports summarize ambient and source monitoring data and
provide information on the quality assurance and quality control measures performed to ensure
accurate data352. US Federal regulations require each major source of air pollutant emissions to
obtain an "operating permit" that consolidates all of the air pollution control requirements into a
single, comprehensive document covering all aspects of the source's air pollution activities. Air
pollution permits are also required for businesses that build new pollution sources or make
significant changes to existing pollution sources. These are sometimes referred to as
"preconstruction" or "new source review" permits. In Australia, a monitoring program must be
developed by each license holder. The license holder should use a risk-based approach to determine
the level of monitoring required. License holders must file an annual performance statement353.

In Mexico there are two main ways to perform the monitoring and verification of the capture
activities: through control instruments provided by SEMARNAT and through private certifiers.
Governmental control of air emissions is carried out through the Sole Environmental License and
the Annual Operations Inventory. The Regulations on the General Law on Climate Change state
that any facility that generates more than 25 000 tons of CO2 is subject to reporting. This report will
be sent to the SEMARNAT and will include the composition of the gases and greenhouse
compounds, according to article 87 of the General Law on Climate Change.

 Gap 10
 In Mexico, monitoring, reporting and verification requirements for CO2 capture are only regulated
 for activities that generate air emissions that are considered stationary sources. Monitoring of CO 2
 needs to be carried out every three or six months depending on the activity and needs to be
 reported once a year by means of the Annual Emissions Inventory. However, the obligations
 depend on the classification of the stationary source in order to confirm if such a source is under
 Federal or local jurisdiction. There are some States that only have the obligation to obtain an air
 emissions’ operation license but do not have any obligation related to monitoring and reporting.
 This can be considered as a gap in case the activity that captures CO2 is considered local.

 Likewise, the General Law on Climate Change provides for the regulation of atmospheric
 emissions and greenhouse compounds, as well as carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector
 which needs to include monitoring and reporting of the CO2 captured. However, such legal
 provisions have not been created, which is considered a gap.

 Finally, the General Law on Climate Change provides an additional monitoring and reporting
 obligation for any facility that generates more than 25,000 tons of CO2; however, there is no
 additional monitoring and reporting obligations for any activity that generates fewer than 25,000
 tons of CO2. This can also be considered as a gap.

In order to resolve the aforementioned gaps, some amendments to local legislation must be reached.
This may be considered as a barrier since it is a complicated process and needs to be performed in
many States in Mexico and it may also take a considerable amount of time.

4.11 INSPECTION OF CAPTURE INSTALLATIONS

No specific requirements with regard to the inspection of industrial installations in relation to CO2
capture were identified in the IEA Model Regulatory Framework. Nevertheless, CO2 capture can be
subject to inspections by competent authorities as part of general inspection requirements for
industrial installations in relation to the atmospheric emissions.

In the EU, Member States are required to set up a system of environmental inspections of CO 2
capture installations within the IED rules and system in order to ensure examination of the full
range of environmental effects from the installation concerned. Operators must afford the
competent authorities all necessary assistance to enable those authorities to carry out any site visits,
to take samples and to gather any information necessary. This is to be differentiated to the Member
States’ obligation under the CCS Directive to establish a system of inspections of storage
complexes (see below). In Canada, the Compliance Inspection Program empowers department
inspectors to review and inspect all aspects of any facility's approval or registration, in one visit.
The review and inspection can include taking samples of soil, groundwater and effluent and of air
emissions at their source. Significant non-compliance can result in enforcement action. 354 USEPA
works with its federal, state and tribal regulatory partners to monitor and ensure compliance with
clean air laws and regulations in order to protect human health and the environment. The Clean Air
Act (CAA) is the primary federal law governing air pollution355. In Australia VEPA has been
inspecting to collect up-to-date information and validate the risk ratings that have been assigned to
individual sites. In addition to planned license compliance inspections (informed by LORA 356),
VEPA also inspects licensed sites as part of auditing a licensee’s annual performance statement,
responding to pollution and emergency reports and incidents, undertaking local, regional, or sector-
based strategic compliance initiatives357.

In Mexico, the inspection procedure is likely to be performed by the PROFEPA for installations on
shore and not related to the oil or gas industries under Federal jurisdiction and ASEA if the project
is related to the hydrocarbons’ sector, regardless of the location of these projects or their links to

aquifers.

Inspection procedures performed by the aforementioned authorities can be done in two ways: i)
randomly, for each one of those authorities which is entitled to do so, and ii) as a consequence of an
environmental complaint made by members of the community or environmental authorities.

A third verification procedure is the self-regulation and environmental audits’ system for the
industry under Federal jurisdiction. This means that the project has mechanisms to regulate and
monitor its environmental performance, and define the necessary preventive and corrective
measures. This system exceeds mandatory environmental standards and is subject to environmental
and tax benefits proposed by SEMARNAT.

Within the hydrocarbons’ sector, and after the entry into force of the Energy reform, ASEA is in
charge of issuing the corresponding regulation regarding capture, exploration, transportation and
industrial CO2 injection for projects that improve the extraction of hydrocarbons.

 Gap 11
 Inspection procedure is regulated for stationary sources that generate air emissions including CO 2
 regulated by applicable legislation on environmental matters. However, the inspection procedure
 only works to confirm if the stationary sources have the corresponding permits and if they comply
 with maximum permissible limits of contaminants into the atmosphere established in the Mexican
 Official Standards. However, in case any other procedure related with the capture of CO2 needs to
 be inspected, there is no regulation in the current legislation. This could be considered as a gap.

 Likewise, for the hydrocarbons’ sector, ASEA is in charge of issuing the corresponding
 regulation regarding capture which as of today has not been created. This is also considered as a
 gap.

In order to resolve the aforementioned gaps, there are some barriers to be considered, such as the
amendments to the current or the creation of new legislation. This would mean that approval from
the Congress of Union would be needed or, in case of regulations and provisions, the corresponding
issuance from the Executive branch of the Federal government. External factors (such as political
agendas, lobbying and considerable time constraints) may cause some difficulties in this regard.

4.12 AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (PIPELINES
     REGULATIONS ETC...)

Captured CO2 can be transported by various means including pipeline, ship, road, tanker or rail.
Considering there should be regulations in place for transportation through the above mentioned
means, such regulations could be extended to include CO2 transportation.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework points out as key regulatory issues (a) health, safety,
civil and environmental protection in the event of CO2 releases during transportation (b) allocation
of liability in the event of damage resulting from CO 2 releases (c) Pipeline re-use, routing/corridor
requirements and acquisition of rights-of-way (d) accounting for fugitive emissions in a project’s
emissions’ inventory and (e) third-party access to CO2 transportation networks.

Authorization of transportation infrastructure is not regulated under the CCS Directive. Provisions
of the EIA Directive are applicable to the permitting process for CO 2 pipelines. Before the final
decision on a permit for a transportation network is granted, the permitting authority must take into
account the results of the public consultation and the environmental impact assessment. CO2

                                                                                                  129
pipelines in Canada are regulated by the Pipeline Act. Pipelines that cross provincial or national
borders are regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB). The Pipeline Act establishes the
obligation to hold a license before constructing a pipeline, or any part of a pipeline, or undertake
any operations preparatory or incidental to the construction of a pipeline, unless the regulator
considers the public interest358. Licensing of new CO2 pipelines in the US is governed by State law.
There is currently no comprehensive national regulatory scheme for the transport of CO2. However,
many state administrative codes require a pipeline to be licensed or permitted prior to operation. In
Australia, the legal requirements for pipelines depend on whether they are located offshore or
onshore359. Offshore pipelines require a management plan as well as consent for the construction
and consent for operation. For an on shore pipeline, a Consultation Plan is required prior to a
proponent giving notice to each land owner and occupier of the intention to enter land or of a
pipeline corridor, as well as a Construction Environmental Management Plan, a Construction Safety
Management Plan, as well as consent for the construction and consent for operation.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the IEA CCS Legal and Regulatory
Reviews, in particular the CCS Regulatory Test Toolkit for Romania, revealed that each county
traversed by the pipeline would have to issue the building permit for the section of the pipeline
traversing its territory. Furthermore, certain aspects require clarification or amending, such as the
legal regime of the land affected by the route of the transport pipeline, the means for technically and
physically securing the pipes and the strategy for expropriations.

Mexican legislation does not provide for specific regulation for the transportation of CO2 for CCUS
projects. Nevertheless, there are regulations in place that apply to pipelines which would be (in
general terms) suitable for CCUS projects.

Gap 12
There is a major gap in current legislation on this matter since there is no specific legislation for
the transportation of CO2. ASEA has the obligation to develop regulatory requirements in relation
to authorizations for the transport of oil, and possibly CO2, but only related to the hydrocarbon
sector. Such regulation has not yet been developed. Likewise, Mexico has some regulations related
to the transport of natural gas that could be used for the transport of CO 2, but specific technical
requirements for the transport of CO2 are likely to be necessary. Finally, there are also regulations
for the transport of materials, hazardous materials and hazardous wastes by means of road, railroad
and sea that will need to be amended in order to comply with the technical requirements for
transporting CO2.

In order to create the corresponding legislation that allows the obtainment of authorization for the
transport of CO2, new legislation must be created or, in the best case scenario, amendments to the
current legislation must be reached. Both options have some barriers since approval from the
Congress of Union will need to be obtained, with the exception of transport related with the
hydrocarbons’ sector that is already included in the general legislation and we are only waiting for
regulations and guidelines to be issued by the competent agency.

4.13 THIRD-PARTY ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

pipeline, network of pipelines or storage site, issues of third-party access can occur, given that
national authorities have an interest in optimizing the use of that capacity. If operators try to prevent
potential new connectors from entering the market, without any reasonable technical or economic
grounds, the relevant authority may consider implementing laws that set conditions by which
operators are obliged to grant third-party access to CO2 pipelines and storage sites.

In the EU, access to CO2 transport networks and storage sites, irrespective of the geographical
location of potential users within the Union, could be a condition for the internal electricity and heat
market, depending on the relative prices of carbon and CCS. The requirements for the CCS
transportation infrastructure are regulated by the CCS Directive. Member States must establish
measures to ensure that potential users are able to obtain access to transport networks and storage
sites, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. Access may be refused on the grounds of
lack of capacity or incompatibility of technical aspects.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework points out the following key regulatory issues:

         health, safety, civil and environmental protection in the event of CO 2 releases during
          transportation;
         allocation of liability in the event of damage resulting from CO2 releases;
         pipeline re-use, routing/corridor requirements and acquisition of rights-of-way;
         accounting for fugitive emissions in a project’s emissions inventory; and
         third-party access to CO2 transportation network specifications.

Duly substantiated reasons must be given for such refusal. Currently, Alberta Province does not
have any existing regulatory requirements for third party access to CO 2 pipelines. The system used
for upstream oil and gas pipelines is the common carrier order; however, it does not include CO2
pipelines in the common carrier system360. In the US, third party transportation infrastructure is
regulated at State level. A Victoria Pipelines Act licensee may enter into an agreement with any
person for, or in relation to, the conveying by the licensee by means of the pipeline of anything
belonging to that person that is authorised to be conveyed through the pipeline361. If a licensee fails
to enter into an agreement, the person seeking that agreement may apply to the Minister for
directing the licensee to convey, by means of the pipeline, the whole or a specific part of the thing
sought to be conveyed362. The matters that the Minister may consider may include: (a) the capacity
of the pipeline; (b) the impact of the proposal on the safety of the pipeline; and (c) any additional
costs to the licensee of the proposal.

Third-party access to transportation infrastructure is not specially designed for CCUS projects under
Mexican law. Nevertheless, after the Mexican Energy Reform entered into force, regulations for
third-party access for the transportation of liquefied natural gas were issued. These regulations
could be construed and interpreted to permit third-party access to the transportation infrastructure of
CCUS projects, provided the infrastructure complies with the technical requirements for CO2
transportation and the authority agrees to construe these regulations in order to enable CO 2
transportation. The establishment of Integrated Systems (Sistemas Integrados), which are
interconnected pipelines and storage facilities that provide transportation services to third parties, is
provided for in the Hydrocarbon Law. However, it is of great importance to determine whether the
Integrated Systems will have the technical characteristics to provide transportation services for

CCUS projects, as well as to establish if the use of transportation services will be limited to the
transportation of hydrocarbons.

 Gap 13
 There are no specific regulations in Mexico for third party access to the transportation network
 for CO2, which can be considered as a gap. Nevertheless, derived from the Energy Reform in
 Mexico, regulations for third party access in relation to the transportation of liquefied natural gas
 have been developed. Such regulations can be used for CO2 but only for EOR activities or any
 other activity related to the hydrocarbons’ sector and only if the infrastructure complies with
 technical requirements for transportation and some amendments to such legislation are approved
 in order to include CO2 in the current provisions.

In order to remove the referred gap, amendments to the current legislation on the hydrocarbons’
sector need to be approved which can be considered a barrier. Likewise, amendments to any other
applicable legislation related to the transportation of any substance or the creation of new legislation
need to be implemented in order to include third party access to the transportation of CO2 This can
also be considered a barrier since approval from the Congress of Union will be needed, or in the
best case scenario, from the Executive branch of the Federal Government in case of regulations or
guidelines to current laws. Such approvals depend, in most cases, on external factors such as
political agenda or agreements and may take a considerable amount of time.

4.14 TRANSBOUNDARY MOVEMENT OF CO2

The capture, transportation and storage of CO2 can lead to potential trans-boundary issues such as
the capture in one jurisdiction and subsequent cross border transportation for storage in a different
jurisdiction or a use of storage complexes that span jurisdictional borders. It could also lead to
unintended migration or leakage of injected CO2 in the sub-surface across jurisdictional borders.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework raises certain issues that could be encountered during
the capture, transportation and storage:

        capture in one jurisdiction and subsequent, cross border transportation in pipelines, or other
         means of transportation, for storage in a different jurisdiction;
        transit arrangements in which CO2 passes through a third jurisdiction to arrive at its final
         storage destination;
        unintended migration or leakage of injected CO2 in the sub-surface across jurisdictional
         borders;
        use of storage complexes that span jurisdictional borders; and
        appropriate dispute resolution processes

The IEA Legal and Regulatory Reviews state that the amendment to the London Protocol enabling
the export of CO2 streams for the purpose of sequestration in transboundary sub-seabed geological
formations, is a step forward although there are only two ratifying parties.

In cases of transboundary movement of CO2 in the EU, the competent authorities of the Member
States concerned must jointly meet the requirements of the CCS Directive and other relevant EU
legislation. The legislation provides little more on such matters except for dispute settlement in the
event of cross-border disputes. There are no specific Alberta Province regulations about
transboundary movement of CO2. There are no specific US regulations about transboundary
movement of CO2. In Australia there is no legal disposition regarding transboundary movement of

                                                                                                    132
CO2.

There is no particular regulation in Mexico regarding trans-boundary movement of CO2. However,
if CO2 were categorized as a hazardous waste it would be subject to the Basel Convention. Mexico
is a State Party of the Basel Convention, which includes a legal framework that regulates
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, as well as the liability related with these activities.

Finally, it should be noted that the transboundary movement of CO2 via land is not prohibited by the
London Protocol and can thus be subject to bilateral or multilateral agreements concluded by
Mexico and its neighboring countries.

 Gap 14
 In Mexico there are no specific regulations for the transboundary movement of CO2, which has
 to be considered as a gap. However, only in cases where CO2 is mixed with a hazardous waste,
 then transboundary movements can be regulated by the provisions of the Basel Convention since
 Mexico is a State Party. Likewise, if CO2 is considered a waste, it can be regulated by the
 London Protocol to which Mexico is a Party, but only with regard to transboundary maritime
 transportation. It should be noted in this context that, for transboundary transportation to be
 allowed by the London Protocol, the amendment to Article 6 of this Protocol needs to enter into
 force following ratification by a sufficient number of parties. This is not yet the case, which
 makes the transportation of CO2 over water currently impossible. For the transboundary
 transportation over land, Mexico may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with
 neighboring states.

 With regard to the hydrocarbons’ sector, ASEA has the authority to regulate any matter related
 to the transport of CO2, including transboundary movement (in Mexico’s jurisdiction) for
 matters such as CO2 injection for EOR activities. Notwithstanding, as of today such regulations
 have not been issued, which is considered as a gap.

In order to fill the referred gaps, new legislation needs to be created under Mexican jurisdiction for
the transboundary movement of CO2 without being considered as a waste, or hazardous waste.
Mexico may also conclude international agreements with its neighboring countries to enable the
transportation of CO2 by land. To achieve such goals there will be a number of factors that could
hinder the process, such as international negotiations for agreeing and signing a treaty which are
expected to take a considerable amount of time.

4.15 DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY APPLICABLE TO CO2 STORAGE

Definitions and terminology applicable to CO2 storage should be required to describe the scope and
meaning of certain technical terms; clarify the meaning of certain events, activities or processes;
and implement certain standards, conventions or agreed requirements as set out in international
legal instruments.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that it may be beneficial to identify the intended
scope of the framework, including the framework’s regulated activities and t he activities that fall
outside the scope of the framework to avoid ambiguity. Furthermore, definitions should provide
clarity to enable effective enforcement, while also being flexible enough to enable the regulatory
framework to cover a range of possible CO2 sources and geological settings.

The CCS Directive provides an extensive list of definitions of the main terms used, including, for
example, geological storage, storage site, storage permit, migration, leakage, corrective measures,

                                                                                                  133
etc. In Canada, The Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Act does not define storage or storage
right. However, the Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act was amended to add “or
sequestration” after storage363. In the US, Title 40 of Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR) has the
following legal definitions relating to CO2 storage: Area of Review, Geologic sequestration,
Geologic sequestration project, Injectate364, Injection zone, Pore space, Post-injection site care and
Site closure365. The GGGS Act has the following definition applicable to CO2 storage: Greenhouse
gas sequestration project and Underground geological formations366.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the IOGCC Model Statute for the
Geologic Storage of Carbon Dioxide includes definitions of carbon dioxide, oil or gas, reservoir,
storage facility, storage operator, geologic storage.

There is no precise definition of CO2 storage or to any other process of CCUS activities in the
current regulatory framework in Mexico.

 Gap 15
 There are no definitions in current legislation related to CO2 storage and therefore this is
 considered a gap. However, in the scenario where CO2 would be considered as a hazardous waste
 as it would be mixed with a hazardous waste, the definitions of the General Law for the
 Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes would apply.

 Likewise, CO2 storage related with hydrocarbon activities in specific EOR activities, is mentioned
 in the ASEA act in a very general way. Hence, some regulations need to be created by ASEA in
 order to specifically regulate CO2 storage activities, which as of today, is considered as a gap.

In order to regulate CO2 storage without considering it as hazardous waste, some legislation needs
to be created or amended. This may be considered as a barrier in Mexico since approvals from the
Congress of Union, or in the case of regulations, the Executive branch of the Government could be
difficult to obtain. This is due to the fact that most cases depend on several factors, such as political
agenda, which can make the process difficult and could take an unreasonable amount of time.

4.16 THIRD-PARTY ACCESS TO STORAGE SITE

As mentioned in section 13 above, regarding third party access to transportation infrastructure,
issues of third-party access can also occur in cases of spare capacity of a storage site. As such, the
IEA recommends that relevant authorities consider implementing laws that set conditions by which
operators are obliged to grant third-party access to storage sites.
In the EU, requirements for third-party access to storage sites are exactly the same as for third-party
access to transport networks. There is currently no regulation in the Alberta Province that deals
directly with third party access or open access to pore space or CO2 sequestration. There are,
however, some portions of the Mines and Minerals Act and Carbon Sequestration Tenure
Regulation that allow for the transfer of tenure between parties, and that give the Minister of Energy
the authority to reduce the area of a permit or lease upon application of the permittee or lessee367.
Third party access to storage sites is regulated at state level in the US. The GGGS Act provides for

third parties and existing injection and monitoring license holders to enter into agreements for the
injection and storage of CO2 in a storage site in the existing license area, provided the agreement
conforms with the license and the Act more broadly. If the parties cannot reach such an agreement,
the third party can apply to the Minister for a binding direction for the third party to inject and store
CO2 in the relevant storage formation, provided various conditions are satisfied368.

In Mexico there is no regulation of third-party access to storage sites.

 Gap 16
 Considering that in Mexico there is no regulation related to third-party access to storage sites of
 CO2, we should consider the latter as a gap for the development of such activities.

In order to eliminate such a gap, the creation or amendment of legislation will be needed. This can
be a barrier due to the process that is needed in Mexico for the issuance of such legislation.
Additionally, there are some external factors that may make the process difficult and can delay the
issuance of such provisions, such as political agendas or election times.

4.17 AUTHORIZATION OF STORAGE SITE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES

Exploration activities involve a variety of technical, geological, environmental, and economic and
political considerations, which should be reflected as components of an exploration authorisation
application.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that requirements vary from country to country
from a single authorization or license to a combination of multiple authorizations and/or licenses.
Furthermore, there are similarities between the techniques used to explore for oil and gas and those
used to explore for CO₂ storage sites, so frameworks can be built on oil and gas exploration
experience.

The CCS Directive of the EU states that exploration can be carried out only with an exploration
permit, which is defined as the written and reasoned decision authorising exploration, and
specifying the conditions under which it may take place, issued by the competent authority pursuant
to the requirements of this Directive. The details of permit granting procedures are to be decided at
national (Member State) level. Exploration permits are granted in respect of a limited volume area.
An environmental impact assessment is not required for exploration activities. In Alberta,
exploration activities firstly require coming to an agreement with the land owner through direct
negotiation, similar to oil and gas activities. The Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation allows
operators to acquire a permit for the evaluation of a potential storage site to investigate the geology
and determine the suitability of the site for CO2 sequestration369. Exploration rights to CCS
formations in the US could be obtained, either through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
land use authorization process, or through exploration leases for private lands. In either case, the
right conferred would be a right to access and a right to explore geologic formations370. The GGGS
Act establishes the greenhouse gas sequestration exploration permits that confers the right to carry
out greenhouse gas sequestration exploration in the permit area to do anything in that area that is
necessary for, or incidental to, that purpose. If the holder of an exploration permit discovers an
underground geological storage formation in the permit area that is likely to be geologically suitable
for the permanent storage of a greenhouse gas substance, the holder has the right to apply for the

grant of an injection and monitoring license, or a greenhouse gas sequestration formation retention
lease371.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the Global CCS Institute CCS
Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago concludes that the regulations and permits relating to
activities in the petroleum industry will also potentially apply to a CCS project in two ways (1) they
will certainly apply to an oil and gas CCS host project, particularly if it engages in EOR activities
(2) the systems already in place for exploration of the subsurface could potentially relate to
exploration for storage purposes.

Although there is not a unique databank for CCUS activities, information concerning the sites and
deposits is in the hands of the Mexican Geological Service for the basins related to mines, and the
CNH and Pemex for deposits related to the exploitation of oil and gas. The Mexican Geological
Service is entitled to provide geological and geophysical information of the country, as well as to
update the Mexican Geological Atlas.

The information of hydrocarbons’ exploration and exploitation deposited is subject to strict
confidentiality and can only be obtained through the several agreements for exploration and
extraction that the National Hydrocarbons Commission offers.

 Gap 17
 There is no specific authorization for activities related to exploring CO2 possible storage sites
 which is considered a gap. The only information that exists is in the hands of the Mexican
 Geological Service for the basins related to mines and the CNH and Pemex for deposits related to
 the possible exploitation of oil and gas which is difficult to obtain since it is restricted to the use
 of persons that execute agreements with the National Hydrocarbons Commission since it is not
 considered as public information.

In order to resolve such a gap, some amendments to the current legislation must be carried out in
order to make public the information and also to include specific authorizations for the exploration
of CO2 storage sites. In the case of the hydrocarbons’ sector, ASEA can regulate such a matter by
including it in the provisions to be created, since it has the authority to regulate everything
concerning CO2 storage related with hydrocarbon activities, such as EOR. The referred amendments
can be considered as a barrier since the Executive branch of the Federal government need to
approve such amendments, which could be difficult due to factors such as political agenda and
preferential matters and also could take a considerable amount of time.

4.18 REGULATING               SITE    SELECTION   FOR   STORAGE        AND     CHARACTERIZATION
     ACTIVITIES

In regulating site selection for storage and characterization activities, the IEA CCS Model
Regulatory Framework states that in practice, the detailed steps and information may be best
implemented through secondary regulatory instruments, rather than through any primary legal
instrument. Regulation of this area should focus on performance characteristics to be achieved in a
storage site, rather than mandating techniques or processes to achieve those performance standards.

In accordance with Article 4 of the CCS Directive, Member States have the right to determine the
areas in which storage sites may be selected. This right includes the right to prohibit any storage in
parts of, and in the whole territory of, a Member State concerned. Those Member States which

                                                                                                     136
intend to allow CO2 storage on their territory must carry out an assessment of storage capacity
available in their territory, including by allowing exploration. The suitability of a geological
formation for use as a storage site must be determined through a characterisation and assessment of
the potential storage complex and surrounding area. A geological formation may only be selected as
a storage site, if under the proposed conditions of use, there is no significant risk of leakage, and if
no significant environmental or health risks exist. The criteria for suitability of the storage site are
defined in Annex I of the CCS Directive, including the components of the risk assessment.

In the Alberta Province, the site selection and characterization period is a first stage in CCS
projects. It begins when a proponent applies for a tenure agreement for the chosen site and includes
granting of all initial regulatory approvals required. The exploration and production of oil and
natural gas has also provided industry and government with knowledge of the subsurface geology of
the province. This knowledge will enable the most suitable sites to be chosen for CO2
sequestration372. In order to choose sites that best meet the parameters above, proponents will
review existing data from oil and gas exploration and production activities and may gather new
data. In the US, owners or operators must gather the data necessary to demonstrate site suitability
and submit this with a Class VI permit application to be evaluated by the UIC Program Director,
prior to receiving authorization to construct the well, and must update and gather more detailed site-
specific information and submit this prior to receiving authorization for injection373. The site
characterization process typically includes a general characterization of regional and site geology,
followed by detailed characterization of the injection zone and confining zones. Additionally, at the
UIC Program Director’s discretion, owners or operators may be required to identify and
characterize additional confining zones to ensure USDW protection, impede vertical fluid
movement, allow for pressure dissipation, and provide additional opportunities for monitoring,
mitigation, and remediation374. The GGGS Act requires exploration permit holders to undertake a
work program for site characterisation designed to establish the characteristics and extent of any
underground storage formations in the permit area; assess the feasibility of injecting CO 2 (or
another greenhouse gas substance) into any identified storage formations; and assess the suitability
of any identified storage formations for permanent storage, in a manner that protects public health
and the environment and will not compromise the integrity of the storage formation.

The selection of the site and its characterization are not regulated. However, SENER, in conjunction
with the Mexican Geological Survey (Servicio Geológico Mexicano), is preparing an update of the
Atlas containing sites with potential for CCUS activities, both in the petroleum sector and in mining
deposits. The Atlas will be accessible to the public in order to promote CCUS activities and reduce
the investment needed for the exploration of the sites.

 Gap 18
 There is no regulation in Mexico for this specific matter, which is considered a gap. We have
 been informed that SENER and the Mexican Geological Survey are updating the Atlas containing
 sites with potential for CCUS activities, both in the hydrocarbons’ sector and mining activities,
 which will be public. Such information can be used in order to regulate site selection and
 characterization activities. However, the Atlas only covers basins and regions and is insufficient
 for local or project aspects.

In the case of the hydrocarbon sector, ASEA may include in the new regulations the provisions for
regulating site selection and characterization activities of CO2 storage. However, if the storing is not
related to the hydrocarbon sector, amendments to the current legislation, or the creation of a specific
one, needs to be carried out. This can be considered as a barrier since the process for the approval
and issuance of amendments or new legislation can be complicated since it necessitates the approval
of the Congress of Union or the Executive branch of the Federal government, which can also
depend on external factors such as political agenda and can take too long.

4.19 AUTHORIZATION OF STORAGE ACTIVITIES

As a storage authorization application generally requires disclosure of information on how the
project will be operated and closed, it is the key tool in ensuring that CCS takes place in an
environmentally safe way. The injection or storage permit contains the authorization by competent
authorities to proceed with the injection of CO2 for its permanent storage as well as an authorization
for the construction of associated infrastructure.

Under the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework, authorisation of storage activities covers both
the operation and periods of a CO2 storage project. Some regulatory frameworks provide for
separate authorisation processes for these two periods. In all cases, a significant amount of
information is required before an authorisation is granted. This information includes detailing how
the project will be operated, including modelling results and a monitoring plan, and how the project
will be closed, including decommissioning and rehabilitation plans. Given this information is
provided before injection commences, there should be a provision for a mechanism to update these
plans in light of actual data being generated over the course of the project. Consultation on the
storage site authorisation application should also be carried out with relevant parties to allow for a
wider set of views to be brought into the decision-making process.

In the EU, the storage permit is the key tool in ensuring that CCS takes place in an environmentally
safe way. No storage is allowed without a permit. The permitting procedure is organized by each of
the Member States, but has to comply with the conditions set out in the EU CCS Directive. Before
an application for a storage permit may be submitted to the competent authority, the potential
operator must carry out an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the EIA Directive.
In Alberta there are two aspects of the CO2 storage component that need to be considered separately
for permitting requirements: (a) the CO2 injection wells and (b) the CO2 subsurface storage
scheme375. The Minister has the power to grant the right to inject captured CO 2 into a subsurface
reservoir for sequestration376. Owners or operators of Class VI wells in the US must prepare five
project plans and submit them to the UIC Program Director for approval with their Class VI permit
application. When the plans are approved, they become an enforceable part of the Class VI permit.
The required project plans, which must be based on site-specific information, include AoR and
Corrective Action Plan, Testing and Monitoring Plan, Injection Well Plugging Plan, Post-Injection
Site Care (PISC) and Site Closure Plan and Emergency and Remedial Response Plan377. The GGGS
Act provides for the holders of exploration permits and retention lease authorities to apply for
injection and monitoring licenses in respect of geologically suitable and commercially viable

storage formations378. For areas not covered by such instruments, or by an expired or cancelled
injection and monitoring license, the Minister can invite applications for licenses379. Once issued, an
injection and monitoring license will entitle the license holder to inject and monitor CO 2 and other
greenhouse gases in the license area, continue to explore for storage formations in the license area
and do anything else within the license area that is necessary for, or incidental to, those purposes380.

The Global CCS Institute CCS Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago states that a CCS
project would potentially work under regulations and permits relating to activities in the petroleum
industry even if there is no specific reference to storage. The Petroleum Act 1969 outlines a number
of ancillary rights, which may be granted in the license release by the Minister of Energy including
the right to enter upon land and to sink boreholes therein for the purpose of searching for and
extracting petroleum, and a right to use and occupy land for the erection of buildings, the laying and
maintenance of such pipes and the construction of such other works as may be required for the
purpose of searching and boring for, and obtaining, carrying away and processing petroleum. The
UCL Carbon Capture Programme Norway developed the first ‘full’ CCS projects at Sleipner (1996)
and Snøhvit (2008) offshore natural gas fields and operates them under the Norwegian petroleum
legislation, without any specific adaptions and also has significant potential for trans-boundary CO2
storage.

In Mexico, there is no authorization for CO2 storage activities. However, there is an authorization
for the final confinement of hazardous waste which could serve as a framework for CCUS projects.
Through this authorization, the injection of hazardous wastes is regulated in order to dispose of such
materials in the subsoil for its confinement in geological formations.

 Gap 19
 There is no specific legal framework in Mexico for authorizing CO2 storage activities, which
 could be considered as a gap. In the specific case where CO2 is mixed with hazardous waste, there
 would be existing regulatory requirements for underground storage that could apply to CO 2
 storage since the mixture would then be regulated as a hazardous waste. Other cases in which no
 hazardous waste is included in the CO2 stream would not be covered nor authorized by existing
 legislation. Moreover, the Energy Reform allows ASEA to regulate CO2 storage activities but
 only if related to hydrocarbon activities. Such regulations have not yet been issued. This
 constitutes a gap. If saline aquifers are considered for storage activities, a permit from the
 National Waters Commission (CONAGUA) is needed for the use of a national body of water. It is
 important to take into consideration that most saline aquifers are interconnected and are not
 contained. The migration of CO2 is therefore an important aspect of MRV requirements in this
 case. Likewise, Federal Official Standards that contain maximum permissible limits of
 contaminants into national bodies of waters shall be modified in order to include maximum limits
 of C02 to be injected.

In order to fill such gaps, some regulations need to be created in order to include, in existing
legislation or in a new one, specific provisions for the storage of CO2. This can be considered as a
barrier since in Mexico the process for issuing modifications to a current legislation or the creation
of a new one is complicated as it will be necessary to obtain the approval from the Congress of
Union in some cases and in others from the Executive branch of the Federal government. For this
process external factors would need to be considered, such as political agendas, election times and
the time it would take.

4.20 INTERNATIONAL LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

In the EU, legal barriers to the geological storage of CO2 under the seabed have been removed by
the adoption of related risk management frameworks under the 1996 London Protocol on the
Prevention and Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matter. In 2006, the Contracting Parties
to the London Protocol adopted amendments to the Protocol which allow and regulate CO2 storage
in geological formations under the seabed. To date, among EU countries, only the UK and the
Netherlands have ratified the amendment381. Also, the Contracting Parties to the Convention for the
Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) adopted amendments to
the Annexes to the Convention in order to allow CO2 storage under the seabed. They also adopted a
Decision to ensure environmentally safe CO2 storage and Guidelines for Risk Assessment and
Management of CO2 storage. In addition, a Decision to prohibit storage of CO2 in the water-column
of the sea and on the seabed has been issued382. Canada is part of the following international marine
agreements relevant for CCS projects: Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention) and the related 1996 Protocol
to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter,
1972, (the 1996 Protocol). This means that disposal of any substance into the sea, or even into the
sub-seabed, from a ship, aircraft platform or other structure is not allowed unless it is done in
accordance with a permit issued by Environment Canada (EC)383. The US ratified the London
Convention in 1975. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) is the US law
that implements this treaty. In 1992, the parties to the London Convention began a comprehensive
review of the Convention, resulting in a new treaty called the 1996 Protocol. The US signed the
Protocol in 1998, but has not yet ratified it384. Australia is party to the following international
conventions: (a) the London Convention (Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972). However, Australia has not ratified the amendment to
the Convention (1996 Protocol) (b) The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships 1973 (MARPOL), (as amended by the Protocol of 1978) is the main international
convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or
accidental causes (c) the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Part XII –
Protection and preservation of the marine environment. UNCLOS does not explicitly mention CO2,
and there has been some discussion as to whether CO2 falls within the definition of “waste”.

The London Protocol is applicable, generically, for CCUS projects. This Protocol on the Prevention
of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter regulates dumping and defines it as: i)
any deliberate disposal into the sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or
other man-made structures at sea; ii) any deliberate disposal into the sea of vessels, aircraft,
platforms or other man-made structures at sea; and iii) any storage of wastes or other matter in the
seabed and the subsoil thereof from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea.
Taking into account those broad definitions, CCUS projects can be considered subject to the
London Protocol.

 from the ratification of the amendment to Article 6 of the London Protocol, to which Mexico is a
 Party.

4.21 PROJECT INSPECTIONS OF STORAGE SITES

Provision for inspections (both periodic and ad hoc / routine and non-routine) should be included in
storage authorisations to allow for regulatory oversight (monitoring of compliance with the terms of
the authorisation) to be enforced as well as allowing flexibility in cases where an operator wishes to
extend the life of the storage operation.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that inspections are not unique to CCS
operations, but occur in most industrial operations. They involve access to both property and
information and the power to inspect granted by a CO2 storage regulatory framework may extend to
access to third-party property. Relevant authorities may potentially be supported by third-party
verifiers. Frequency, timing and appropriate party to undertake periodic reviews (e.g. which
authority and/or the use of third-party verifiers) will depend on common practice in a particular
region.

In the EU, each Member State is required to carry out routine and non-routine inspections of the
storage complex. Routine inspections must be carried out at least once a year until three years after
closure, and every five years until transfer of responsibility to the competent authority has occurred.
Non-routine inspections must be carried out when a competent authority receives complaints about
damage to the environment and human health or reports about leverages. In Canada, The Mines and
Minerals Act entitles the Minister, or a person designated by the Minister, to investigate or inspect
any well, installation, equipment or other facility used or formerly used in connection with the
injection of a substance into a subsurface reservoir for sequestration385. USEPA proposed annual
external Mechanical Integrity Testing (MIT) using a tracer survey, a temperature or noise log, a
casing inspection log, or any other test the Director requires. USEPA sought comments on the
appropriate frequency and types of MITs for Class VI wells. In general, commenters requested
flexibility in methods and timing of testing, with some suggesting a five-year frequency for external
MIT. In addition, the Class VI Rule allows the Director discretion to require the use of casing
inspection logs to determine the presence or absence of any casing corrosion. In Australia, the
GGGS Act enables the Minister to authorize inspectors, who can in turn carry out inspections for
the purposes of determining compliance with the Act386. Inspectors are given a wide range of
powers, including the power to:
     enter any premises believed to be used for a CO2 sequestration operation;
     inspect the premises and anything on the premises;
     copy documents
     seize items, where necessary, to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction;
     test equipment;
     take photographs and audio and visual recordings; and
     use assistants in exercising the above powers387.

Regarding OPGGS Act inspections, the Minister has the power to appoint greenhouse gas
inspectors with the following powers388: (a) access any part of the offshore area or any structure,

vessel, aircraft or building in an offshore area, the use of which is believed to be connected to
exploration, pre-injection processing, injection, storage or transport in offshore CO2 sequestration
operations; (b) inspect and test any equipment the use of which is believed to be connected to any of
those operations; and (c) enter any structure, vessel, aircraft, building or place believed to contain
documents relating to any of those operations.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies the Global CCS Institute CCS
Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago the Occupational Safety and Health Act 2004 applies
to industrial establishments in private and public sectors onshore and offshore to manage safety,
health and welfare in the workplace.

In Mexico, the CCUS storage facilities will be submitted to the inspection procedures of the
PROFEPA, the Ministry of Navy, CONAGUA and the ASEA, depending on the characteristics of
the project and its linkage with the hydrocarbons’ sector. PROFEPA is responsible for the
inspection in the case of installations which are not related to the hydrocarbon sector or overseas
waters. The Ministry of the Navy is the authority responsible for the inspection and control of
activities in the Mexican overseas. CONAGUA is the entity responsible for the inspection of
national water related projects not related to hydrocarbon projects. And ASEA is the entity in
charge of inspecting storage facilities if the project is related to the exploration or exploitation of
hydrocarbons, and is an entity empowered to supervise the capture, transport and injection of CO2
for enhanced oil extraction.

Inspections can be carried out at any time by the said authorities, or can arise from a complaint
initiated by members of the community or the authorities.

In the event that there is any anomaly detected in the inspection procedure, the environmental
authority will start an administrative procedure and may order security measures, as well as the
respective sanctions.

In relation to project inspections, we do not consider the existence of a gap or barrier in the current
legislation since, with the current provision, the CCUS storage facilities will be submitted to
inspection procedures of several agencies depending on the characteristics of the project and its
linkage with the hydrocarbons’ sector. However, in order to avoid any interpretation regarding the
authority of such agencies for inspecting and reviewing CCUS activities, some amendments to the
current legislation can be made. This can be considered as a barrier since the process for obtaining
such amendments is complicated and can take a considerable amount of time.

4.22 MONITORING REPORTING AND VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CO2
     STORAGE

Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) is important for safety and environmental
compliance, and project-based and national accounting of greenhouse gas emission reductions,
among other considerations.

Regarding monitoring, reporting and verification requirements for CO2 storage, the IEA CCS
Model Regulatory Framework states that detailed approaches should not be included in primary
legislation (flexibility) and further technical guidance for monitoring plan design in secondary legal
instruments or in technical guidance documents may be appropriate. Operators should submit an
initial monitoring plan/proposed monitoring portfolio as part of a storage authorization application,
accompanied by baseline survey data when necessary. Furthermore, there should be a provision for
post-implementation revision of the monitoring plan.

                                                                                                   142
In the EU, monitoring of the injection facilities, the storage complex (including, where possible, the
CO2 plume) and, where appropriate, surrounding environment must be carried out by the operator
on a basis of a monitoring plan that must be approved by the permitting authority in the
authorisation procedure. The operator must report to the competent authority, at a frequency
decided by this authority, however, in any event at least once a year. In addition, in the event of
leakages or significant irregularities, the operator must immediately notify the competent authority .
In Canada, the Minister of Energy is responsible for the approval of Monitoring, Measure and
Verification (MMV) and closure plans, as part of the tenure application process389. The Carbon
Sequestration Tenure Regulation presently requires an annual report to the Minister of Energy
containing the findings and observations from MMV activities conducted for carbon sequestration
lease holders390. In the US, the Class VI Rule requires owners or operators of Class VI wells to
perform several types of activities during the lifetime of the project in order to ensure that the
injection well maintains its mechanical integrity, that fluid migration and the extent of pressure
elevation are within the limits described in the permit application, and that USDWs are not
endangered391. In Australia, the monitoring of CO2 injection requires an injection and monitoring
license392. The monitoring of injected CO2 is in turn one of the key rights conferred by such a
license. Before commencing injection of CO2 or other greenhouse gases, the holder of an injection
and monitoring license must submit to the Minister an injection and monitoring plan. Each holder of
an injection and monitoring license must report the outcomes of all monitoring and verification
performed under the license to the Minister. Reports are then to be made publicly available through
the greenhouse gas sequestration register.

There is no specific regulation of the monitoring, reporting and verification of storage or use
activities. However, there are provisions, derived from the LGEEPA, for risk related industrial
projects. Current legislation is likely to comprise CCUS storage, use, and transportation as
environmental highly risky activities. The obligations of reporting and verification are also
established in every Environmental Impact Authorization required for this type of project.

 Gap 21
 There is no specific regulation in Mexico for the monitoring, reporting and verification of CO 2
 storage activities, which shall be considered a gap. If CO2 can be considered as a high risk
 substance and is stored in the amounts enlisted in the current legislation, then it can be regulated
 as a high risk activity for which monitoring, reporting and verification obligations are in place.
 Additionally, in relation to environmental impact matters, some obligations for monitoring,
 reporting and verification are usually included in the Environmental Impact Authorization of the
 CO2 storage activity; however, the authority has the discretion to request it or not.

In order to avoid any type of interpretation related to CO2 storage as a high risk activity or to avoid
depending on the inclusion of such provisions in the individual environmental impact authorization
of the activity, amendments to the current legislation or the creation of a specific instrument are
needed. If the activity is considered a high risk activity, general MRV obligations would apply. This
creation of a new legal instrument or amendments to legislation in Mexico typically depend on a
range of external factors, such as political agendas or election times and take a considerable amount
of time.

Additionally, specific monitoring protocols need to be developed for each of the types of CCUS
activities.

4.23 CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND REMEDIATION MEASURES

Corrective measures are required to protect human health and the environment, and to maintain the
efficacy of a CCS project as a CO2 emissions’ abatement method. Remediation is required to
address any damages associated with significant leakage, unintended migration or other irregularity
in the operation of a storage site. Any significant leakage, unintended migration or other irregularity
in storage site operations should therefore be corrected in a timely manner and damages remediated.
This is confirmed in the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework which identifies these aspects as
essential issues in a regulatory framework for CCUS. The Model moreover notes that responsibility
for performing these measures is usually allocated to operators.

In the EU, during the application for the storage permit, the potential operator must include a
corrective measures’ plan that must be approved by the permitting authority. If a CO2 leak or any
other significant irregularity occurs, the operator must immediately notify the competent authority
and take corrective measures, as a minimum, on the basis of the corrective measures’ plan. In
addition, remedial actions are also specified in the ELD, which regulates the mitigation of
consequences of environmental damage caused by CO2 storage; under both provisions, the
competent authority may at any time require the operator to take the necessary corrective measures,
which may be additional to, or different from, those laid out in the corrective measures’ plan. If the
operator fails to take the necessary corrective measures, the competent authority shall take the
necessary corrective measures itself and shall recover the costs incurred in relation to the measures,
including by drawing on the financial security. In Alberta there are no specific requirements to
undertake corrective and remedial measure requirements as part of CO2 sequestration activities.
However, the Mines and Minerals Act empowers the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make
regulations respecting remedial actions that a lessee must undertake393, including: (a) circumstances
under which a remedial action plan must be prepared and submitted (b) the form, contents,
submission, approval and amendment of plans and (c) reporting requirements. Once a CO2
sequestration project is closed, and ownership and liability for the CO2 has been transferred to the
Government of Alberta, the province will be responsible for conducting post-closure monitoring
and any potential remediation. In the US, the owner or operator of a Class VI well must prepare,
maintain, and comply with a plan to delineate the area of review for a proposed geologic
sequestration project, periodically re-evaluate the delineation, and perform corrective action that
meets the requirements. The area of review is that within which the owner or operator must identify
all penetrations (regardless of property ownership) in the injection zone and determine whether they
have been properly completed or plugged394. A “serious situation” is defined in the GGGS Act to
include events such as leakage of stored CO2, other than anticipated behaviour of CO2, and
compromise of the storage site as a result of CO2 injection395. In the event of a serious situation, the
GGGS Act requires that: (a) the operator reports the serious situation within the period of time
specified in the regulations and (b) the Minister may direct the operator to inject, or otherwise store,
the CO2 in a particular manner, stop or suspend injection, inject CO2 at a specified location, or take
any other action in order to remedy the situation. The OPGGS Act empowers the Minister to give
written directions to holders of greenhouse gas assessment permits and holding leases, and holders
of greenhouse gas injection licenses who have not yet commenced injection, requiring them to396:
(a) remove all property from the title area; (b) plug or close off all wells in the title area; and (c)

provide for the conservation and protection of natural resources in the title area; and make good any
damage to the seabed or subsoil in the title area.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the Global CCS Institute CCS
Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago indicates that Sections 16 and 17 of the Petroleum Act
include, among the duties of the licensee at the expiration of any Exploration and Production
Licence, the duty to restore the licensed area or the surrendered party thereof to their natural and
original condition, reflecting the policy position that operators are responsible for environmental
consequences of activities.

According to the LGEEPA, corrective measures derived from inspection of PROFEPA and
SEMARNAT vary depending on the case and the specifications of the project and the possibility of
environmental damage. The operator will be required to apply corrective or remediation measures
in most of the cases, and depending on the physical aspects and risks of the project.

On the other hand, security measures will be applied by SEMARNAT and ASEA directly, provided
there is an imminent risk of ecological imbalance, damage, deterioration of natural resources,
contamination, dangers for the environment or public health.

There are specific regulations under Mexican legislation that include corrective and remediation
measures on environmental matters that can apply to CO2 storage activities. However, such
measures will apply depending on how CO2 is considered (i.e. material, waste or hazardous waste)
in order to know the obligations set forth for the specific activities and in which cases corrective
and remediation measures can be applied.

On the other hand, ASEA has the authority to impose corrective and remediation measures to any
CO2 storage activities related to the hydrocarbon sector that could create an imminent risk of
ecological imbalance, damage, deterioration of natural resources, contamination, dangers for the
environment or public health.

From the aforementioned, we do not consider the existence of gaps. However, modifications to the
current legislation may be needed in order to define how CO2 storage activities will be regulated in
order to avoid any interpretation related to the obligations that applies to such activities and
therefore the possible corrective and remediation measures that can be imposed in case of an
imminent risk or possible damage.

In order to carry out such amendments, a legal procedure must be followed that will need the
approval of the competent authorities which will usually depend on external factors that can be
considered as a barrier, such as political agenda and agreements. Also, such procedures could take
a reasonable amount of time. The barriers could be more intensive if primary legislation needs to be
amended, for which the approval of the Congress of Union is needed.

4.24 LIABILITY DURING THE PROJECT PERIOD

The entity best placed to bear liability for damage caused by a storage site during exploration,
operation and closure, is the operator of the site.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that leakage or unintended migration of CO 2
from storage sites can lead to a number of potential impacts, which can be categorized in two main
groups (a) localised effects, i.e. environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks and (b) global effects
(atmosphere – compromise of effectiveness of a CCS project as a climate change mitigation

                                                                                                  145
technology). The operator should bear liability for damage to the environment, human health or to
other resources and be required to undertake any corrective measures or remediation measures
associated with the storage site, as well as bear any related costs.

Liability for environmental damage is covered under the ELD in the EU. In principle, the operator
must bear the costs for the preventive and remedial actions taken. However, the operator cannot be
required to bear these costs if he can prove that the environmental damage or imminent threat of
such damage was either (a) caused by a third party and occurred despite the fact that appropriate
safety measures were in place; or (b) resulted from compliance with a compulsory order or
instruction from a public authority. Under normal operating conditions, in the Alberta Province, a
CCS tenure holder is fully liable for all of the CO2 injected into the subsurface and related Post-
Closure Stewardship Fund (PCSF) payments. Because potential orders for third party access would
require an operator to inject another party’s CO2, and not allow other operators into the storage site,
liability (including PCSF payments) for the CO2 should continue to rest with the tenure holder397.
Any costs associated with this liability and PCSF payments can be recovered through compensation
paid by the third party for injecting its CO2. In the US, CO2 itself is not listed as a hazardous
substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). However, the CO2 stream may contain a listed hazardous substance (such as mercury)
or may mobilize substances in the subsurface that could react with ground water to produce listed
hazardous substances. The GGGS Act imposes a number of operational requirements that must be
observed during CO2 sequestration activities. These include (among other things): (a) operators
must rehabilitate any land that is used in carrying out any operation and must, as far as is
practicable, complete such rehabilitation before the relevant license ceases to apply to the land398 (b)
operators must hold insurance against expenses or liabilities from the undertaking of operations399.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies; (i) the IOGCC publication on Carbon
Geologic Storage (2008) and related reports states that during the closure period the operator of the
storage site would be responsible to maintain an operational bond and individual well bonds; (ii) the
UCL Carbon Capture Legal Programme establishes that liability for CO2 during the active injection
phase of a project generally lies with the operator, who must have a right to store in the subsurface
formation into which the CO2 is being injected. The operator is responsible for correcting anything
that goes wrong throughout the life of the storage facility, from site selection and initial
construction, through the active injection period, to eventual closure of the site and thereafter for an
indeterminate period of post-closure care.

In Mexico the liability during the project includes the implementation of the Federal Law on
Environmental Responsibility and the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental
Protection. The Federal Law on Environmental Responsibility sets forth liability for environmental
damage, as well as mitigation and compensation measures. According to this law, any person that
affects the environment is considered responsible for repairing the damage.

The General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection, establishes several
sanctions against breaches of the environmental regulation. These sanctions are enforced by the
SEMARNAT, unless it is a topic related to hydrocarbons, for which the ASEA is the authorized
entity. Likewise, there is other specific legislation, such as the General Law for the Prevention and
Integral Management of Wastes that also establishes several sanctions against breaches of the
environmental regulation related to the matters such legislation was created for. Additionally there

are criminal responsibilities for those that infringe the federal Criminal Code.

There is applicable Federal environmental legislation that regulates possible liabilities aroused
during the operation of a CO2 storage project. In cases where the project is considered under local
jurisdiction, an analysis from each of the state legislations needs to be carried out in order to
confirm if it is well regulated or if there is a gap that needs to be resolved that can be considered
also as a barrier due to the procedure that needs to be followed. The Federal legislation foresees
liabilities for environmental damage in which the person that affects the environment is considered
responsible for repairing damage or in other cases joint liability will be considered.

From the aforementioned, we do not consider the existence of relevant gaps on a Federal level.
However, modifications to the current legislation may be needed in order to define how CO2 storage
activities will be regulated in order to avoid any interpretation related to the obligations that apply
to such activities and therefore the person or persons that will be held liable in case any damage is
generated.

In order to carry out such amendments, a legal procedure must be followed that will need the
approval of the competent authorities which usually will depend on external factors that can be
considered as a barrier, such as political agenda and agreements. Also, such procedures could take
a reasonable amount of time. The barriers could be more intensive if primary legislation needs to be
amended for which the approval of the Congress of Union is needed.

4.25 LIABILITY DURING THE POST-CLOSURE PERIOD

The issue of long-term liability has been seen as one of the most challenging and complex issues
associated with the regulation of CO2 storage activities400. It is also generally considered as one of
the most important issues to address in a regulatory framework prior to the development of CCS
activities. The objective of a CCS project is to enable permanent storage of CO 2. As a consequence,
liability for a storage project might well extend long beyond the lifetime of the operator carrying out
the storage operation. A particular issue to address in this context is the issue of bankruptcy of
operators following post-closure of the site. Long-term liability for CO2 storage activities is
therefore usually addressed by means of a transfer of responsibility from the operator to the
competent authority. In this case, the operator is generally required to satisfy the relevant authority
of negligible risk of future leakage or other irregularity in the storage site before the relevant
authority will assume responsibility for the storage site401.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that the issue of long-term liability has been
seen as one of the most challenging and complex issues associated with the regulation of CO2
storage activities and is generally addressed in one of two ways: (a) provision is made for transfer
of responsibility to the relevant authority or (b) long-term liability is not discussed (and it is
assumed that the operator retains responsibility for a storage site in perpetuity).

In the EU, when a storage site has been closed, the operator remains responsible for the site for a
minimum of 20 years after the site has been closed402. The liability conditions are the same as
during the operation period of the storage site. In case a storage site has been closed after
withdrawal of a storage permit, the competent authority immediately becomes responsible and
liable for the storage site (each Member State must designate a competent authority which is
400
    IEA Model Regulatory Framework, page 100.
401
    IEA Model Regulatory Framework, page 100.
402
    This period can be shortened if the competent authority is convinced that the stored CO 2 will be completely and
permanently contained before the 20 year period elapses.

                                                                                                                147
responsible for management of a storage site after the transfer of responsibility). After the 20 year
period passes, liability for the CO2 storage site is transferred to the competent authority. The Mines
and Minerals Act sets out the liabilities and obligations that the Government of Alberta will assume
when it issues a closure certificate. The tenure application starts the closure process when the
lessees submit an initial closure plan; it continues with interim closure plans submitted every three
years in the injection period; and the final closure plan which is submitted to enter the closure
period403. In the US, under current SDWA provisions, USEPA does not have authority to transfer
liability from one entity to another. Under SDWA authority, owners or operators of injection wells
must ensure protection of USDWs from endangerment and are subject to liability for enforcement
under the Act. The Class VI Rule requires that an owner or operator must conduct monitoring as
specified in the Director-approved PISC and site closure plan following the cessation of injection
until the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Director that the geologic sequestration project
no longer poses an endangerment to USDWs, as such, generally, owner or operator will generally
no longer be subject to enforcement under section 1423 of SDWA. However, after site closure, an
owner or operator may, depending on the fact scenario, remain liable under tort and other remedies,
or under other Statutes404. The Australian Government can assume long term liability for CO2
injected into a formation 15 years after injection operations have ceased, where a "closure assurance
period" in respect of the formation has elapsed405. In contrast, Victoria does not have an equivalent
provision for the transfer of responsibilities to the Victorian Government. Under the OPGGS Act,
all liabilities remain with the operator406.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the IOGCC publication on Carbon
Geologic Storage (2008) and related reports state that at the conclusion of the Closure Period, the
liability would transfer to the state. The state would be responsible for the monitoring, verification
and remediation activities, which could also be exercised through a state-contracted entity.

The provisions and conditions of the closure of the project are contained in the Environmental
Impact Authorization, as well as the regulation issued by SEMARNAT and ASEA. On the other
hand, even after the termination of the project, any project is still responsible for any environmental
damage for 12 years, as stated in the Federal Law on Environmental Responsibility (LFRA), and in
the case of hazardous wastes’ confinement and storage the responsibility is extended up to 20 ye ars.
This means that even after the closure of the project, the individuals are in the scope of application
of the LFRA.

There is applicable Federal environmental legislation that regulates possible liabilities aroused after
the closing of a CO2 storage project by means of the environmental impact authorization and other
environmental provisions. In case the project will be considered under local jurisdiction, an analysis
from each of the state legislations needs to be carried out in order to confirm if it is well regulated
or if there is a gap that needs to be resolved that can be considered also as a barrier due to the
procedure that needs to be followed. The Federal legislation foresees liabilities for environmental
damage during post-closure period in which the person that affects the environment is considered
responsible. Depending on how CO2 will be considered, the liability period may vary (from 12 to 20

Gap 22
There is a gap at the federal level since there is currently no regulation related to liabilities after
the liability period referred in the above paragraph. It will be necessary to regulate the transfer
of responsibility to the competent authority once the liability period ends, as well as the possible
existence of a financial guarantee that will cover any potential damage. Such elements have
been identified as essential for ensuring investors’ confidence in CCUS activities in the model
regulatory frameworks and in all jurisdictions reviewed as part of this study.

Likewise, modifications to the current legislation may be needed in order to define how CO2
storage activities will be regulated in order to avoid any interpretation related to the operator´s
obligations that apply to such activities and for identifying to the operator that they will be held
liable during the post-closure period in case any damage is generated.

In order to carry out such amendments, a legal procedure must be followed that will need the
approval of the competent authorities which will usually depend on external factors that can be
considered as a barrier; such as political agenda and agreements. Also, such procedures could take a
reasonable amount of time. The barriers could be more intensive if primary legislation needs to be
amended for which the approval of the Congress of Union is needed.

4.26 FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO POST-CLOSURE STEWARDSHIP

A financial contribution can provide a means by which the operator bears some financial
responsibility for any long-term risks and cost implications involved in CO2 storage. Where long-
term responsibility for a storage site is transferred to the relevant authority, CCS regulatory
frameworks may reduce the financial exposure of the relevant authority by requiring the operator to
contribute to the costs associated with long-term stewardship of the site407. This contribution can be
accrued over the course of the project or simply be required at the time of storage site closure
authorization408. By requiring a financial contribution to post-closure stewardship, the relevant
authority does not have to carry the financial burden for the long-term liability, unless any financial
liability incurred exceeds the contribution received409.

In the EU, Article 20 of the CCS Directive states that the operator is required to make a financial
contribution available to the competent authority before the transfer of responsibility for a storage
site after the closure of the site takes place410. This contribution must take into account the
characteristics of the storage complex, elements relating to the history of storing CO2 and must at
least cover the anticipated cost of the monitoring of the site for a period of 30 years. The Directive
also requires the establishment of the financial security or any other equivalent, by the potential
operator as part of the application for a storage permit. This is in order to ensure that all obligations
arising under the permit issued pursuant to this Directive, can be met. This financial security shall
be valid and effective before commencement of injection. However, there are important challenges
derived from the inclusion of storage sites under the EU ETS. The liability for leakage is
unquantifiable (as the future value of the EUAs is unknown) and potentially very large relative to
the value of the storage activity. This creates a major barrier to investment in CCS. There is a need
for legislation establishing a system where the risk can be shared between the operator and the

competent authority (maybe through state aid scheme). In 2010, the Carbon Capture and Storage
Statutes Amendment Act created the Post-closure Stewardship Fund (PCSF) which assumes certain
liabilities and obligations of the lessee upon the issuance of a closure certificate. The PCSF was
established to cover the costs associated with some of those assumed liabilities and obligations in
the post-closure period, and to protect the Alberta public from bearing those costs411. Regulations in
the US retain the substantive requirements that owners or operators of Class VI wells demonstrate
and maintain financial responsibility to cover the cost of corrective action, injection well plugging,
PISC and site closure, and emergency and remedial response. The Class VI Rule 412 identifies the
following qualifying financial instruments for Class VI wells, all of which must be sufficient to
address endangerment of USDWs; (a) trust fund (b) surety bond (c) letter of credit (d) insurance (e)
self-insurance (f) escrow account. The GGGS Act requires each holder of an injection and
monitoring license to pay an annual amount towards the estimated long-term monitoring and
verification costs for the storage site, as set out in the approved injection and monitoring plan 413.
The amount is to be determined as a percentage, fixed by the Minister, of the total estimated cost of
long-term monitoring and verification for the site.

In Mexico post-closure stewardship matters may be included in the environmental impact
authorization through the use by the authority of its discretional powers. Additionally, if CO 2 is
considered as a high risk substance, the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental
Protection establishes that an environmental insurance is needed for guaranteeing any
environmental risk that could occur for the managing of a high risk substance. Furthermore, when
related to CCUS-EOR activities, the Hydrocarbons Law states that ASEA has the authority to
regulate financial contribution mechanisms for site abandonment to cover any liabilities.

 Gap 23
 There is no specific regulation for CCUS activities in matters of post-closure which is considered
 a gap (other than those mentioned above and related to EOR activities). Therefore, a CO2 storage
 project should follow post-closure measures indicated in the Environmental Impact
 Authorizations that can include any obligation related to financial contributions for post-closure
 stewardship. However, such provisions are discretional for the competent authorities and may or
 may not be considered in such authorization.

In order to resolve such a gap, some modifications to the current legislation must be created. This
could be interpreted as a barrier since it necessitates the approval of the Congress of Union in case
general laws need to be created or amended, or from the Executive branch of the government for
regulations and guidelines. Only in matters of CO2 storage related to hydrocarbon activities,
provisions have been created by means of the Energy Reform which only needs the creation of
regulations or guidelines for their implementation.

4.27 USING CCS FOR BIOMASS-BASED SOURCES

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that current approaches to greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions’ inventory accounting assign a zero emission factor value to the combustion of
biomass and offgas produced during the fermentation of biogenic residues (e.g. biofuel production).
This is because the CO2 emissions from the combustion of biogenic matter is taken out of the short-
term terrestrial biological carbon pool and is therefore accounted for at the time of removal (as net

changes in the terrestrial biomass carbon stocks). Consequently, it does not need to be added to the
atmospheric stock calculations, as this would lead to the CO2 emissions being counted twice. It is,
however, generally reported for informational purposes.

Biomass-CCS is not covered by the CCS Directive of the EU. Biomass-CCS is not covered by the
Canadian legislation. No specific information was identified for Biomass-CCS in the US. In
Australia there is no reference to Biomass-CCS.

There are no projects using CCS for biomass-based sources currently envisaged in Mexico.

 Gap 24
 There are no projects using CCS for biomass-based sources currently envisaged in Mexico and
 there are no regulations for such type of activities. This can be considered as a gap if these types
 of activities were to be implemented in Mexico.

In order to resolve such a gap, some amendments to the current legislation or the creation of a new
one need to be carried out which means that approval from the competent authorities must be
obtained. The process for the obtainment of such approvals can be considered as a barrier since it
takes a considerable amount of time and in some cases depends on external factors that may not
assure that the approvals will be obtained, such as political agreements.

4.28 ENHANCED HYDROCARBON RECOVERY WITH CCS

CO2 can also be used with a view to enhance hydrocarbon recovery (EHR or EOR). In this context,
a project can be a mere EOR project, with the sole purpose of enhancing hydrocarbon recovery. A
project might also be a joint EOR/CCS project whereby CO2 is injected for the dual purpose of
enhancing hydrocarbon recovery and preventing CO2 from reaching the atmosphere.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that although CCS, joint EHR/CCS and EHR
projects are all likely to result in significant quantities of CO2 being geologically stored, EHR
projects differ from the other two types of projects in a number of important ways. Most
importantly, in EHR projects, monitoring the CO2 plume for unintended migration and leakage is
not routinely undertaken (other than where this has implications for oil recovery), which means
verification of the CO2 stored is not possible. Therefore, a project cannot be considered a CCS
project. Furthermore, from a regulatory perspective, EHR operations will be governed by prevailing
rules on pipeline construction and operation, oilfield management and decommissioning
procedures. Given the different approaches and objectives of EHR as compared to CCS, CCS
regulatory standards for long-term storage and for monitoring and verifying injections should apply
when: hydrocarbon recovery operations at a site come to a close and the operator wishes to convert
the site to a pure CO2 storage operation; and for joint EHR/CCS projects.

Enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR) is not covered by the CCS Directive of the EU. However,
when EHR is combined with geological storage of CO2, the provisions of the CCS Directive would
be applicable. Approval for the operation of a CO2-EOR scheme in Alberta is the responsibility of
the AER under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act414. EOR has been classified as a Class II activity
in the US. However, owners or operators of Class II wells that inject CO2 for the primary purpose of
long-term storage would be required to apply for and obtain Class VI well permits if the UIC

program director determines there is increased risk to underground sources of drinking water 415. In
Victoria, petroleum licenses issued in accordance with the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas
Storage Act 2006 confer, inter alia, a conditional right to416: (a) inject a substance into the seabed or
subsoil of an offshore area (b) store (whether on a permanent basis or otherwise) a substance in the
seabed or subsoil of an offshore area (c) recover petroleum in the license area as a consequence of
the injection of a substance covered by the license.

Regarding the International Best Practices in Model Policies, the IOGCC publication on Carbon
Geologic Storage (2008) and related reports state that in the case of EOR projects, a certain amount
of the injected CO2 remains in the oil reservoir, and should be considered as stored CO2. Therefore,
the right to use an oil reservoir for the associated storage of CO2 would be permissible under an oil
and gas lease. However, when an active oil production ceases and the remaining reservoir capacity
is used for CO2 injection for long-term storage, the extension of the underlying oil and gas lease
granting this authority has not been clearly enumerated in existing law.

EOR activities are not currently regulated in Mexico. Reference to EOR is made in the new
Hydrocarbons Law, and in the ASEA Act, and a mandate is provided to ASEA to develop
implementing guidelines for CCUS activities in the Hydrocarbons’ Sector. In spite of the legal
mandate, there are currently no specific rules to date for Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects.

The regulation for EOR activities is still pending, despite the fact that ASEA is already entitled to
issue regulations and perform inspections of any industrial project consisting of CO2 injection to
improve the production of hydrocarbons.

 Gap 25
 Although it is referred to in the Hydrocarbons Law and in the ASEA Act, at this point there are no
 specific rules for EOR projects. Until the regulation of EOR is created, this must be considered as
 a gap. ASEA is the agency entitled to issue such regulations.

We consider as a barrier that as of today ASEA does not have sufficient and professionalized
personnel which may result in a considerable amount of time being needed for the creation of the
regulations, and in the hope that such will be created before the current political period ends (2018).

4.29 PLANNING REQUIREMENTS (EG. STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT)

In order to ensure their successful implementation, an envisaged CCS project should be in line with
existing plans and programs applicable to the type of activity and the project site. For instance,
zoning or spatial plans should allow for CCS activities, in particular for the injection of CO 2, or
should not contain obstacles to the deployment of such activities. Prior to the development of a CCS
project, it should be checked whether changes to plans are required.

In the EU there are no specific planning requirements designed particularly for CCS projects,
therefore the general legislation is applicable in these cases. An environmental assessment should
be carried out for plans or programs (e.g. on land use, national strategic plans, spatial programmes)
which are likely to have significant environmental effects. All CCS activities (including capture,
transport and storage) require a strategic environmental assessment. The above mentioned
environmental assessment must be carried out during the preparation of a plan or programme and

before its adoption or submission to the legislative procedure. The public, as well as the
environmental authorities, must be informed and consulted on the draft plan or program and the
environmental report prepared. The Regional Strategic Environmental Assessment in Canada does
not mention CCS projects. The Regional strategic environmental assessment (R-SEA) is a means to
assess the potential environmental effects, including cumulative effects, of strategic policy, plan and
program alternatives in Canada. The R-SEA informs future project-based development consent and
environmental impact assessments for projects. In the US, the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of plans, legislation and
regulatory proposals and projects417. NEPA does not list the types of plans and programmes subject
to an SEA obligation, but provides more general wording covering both legislation and any major
Federal actions significantly affecting the human environment. Unlike the EU, NEPA does not
distinguish between EIA and SEA. Under section 146 of the Environment Protection and
Biodiversity Conservation Act 1997 (EPBC Act) of Australia418, strategic assessments are landscape
scale assessments and, unlike project-by-project assessments, which look at individual actions (such
as construction and operation of a pipeline or wind farm), they can consider a much broader set of
actions. For example, a large urban growth area that will be developed over many years, or a fire
management policy across a broad landscape.

In contrast to the environmental framework of other countries, Mexico does not include a procedure
to change the ecological zoning of the territory or any other spatial plans. Those plans and
ecological zoning are issued periodically by federal, state and municipal authorities and there is no
procedure, such as a Strategic Environmental Assessment applicable to them.

Furthermore, the issuance of the Environmental Impact Authorization, which must be obtained in
accordance with article 28 of the LGEEPA, is dependent on the project being consistent with public
policy instruments and regulation related to the project. Public Policy Instruments are derived from
the National Development Plan.

The ecological zoning of the territory is the instrument of environmental policy whose purpose is to
regulate and induce the use of soil and the productive activities to achieve a sustainable use of
natural resources. There are four types of ecological ordering programs.

 Gap 26
 There is no regulation related to planning requirements for the implementation of CCUS
 activities, which can be considered as a gap. For the implementation of such requirements, several
 steps need to be considered that need to start with the use of the land and ecological restrictions.

In order to fill such a gap, some program or ordering needs to be created by the Federal Executive
branch of the government. This could be considered as a barrier because the necessary procedure
may take a significant amount of time and also because it may not be considered as preferential in
the short term by the National or government agenda.

4.30 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION

Environmental impact assessments are standard practices for major infrastructure projects in many
jurisdictions around the world419. An EIA should identify and provide options for minimizing local

and regional environmental impacts related to the capture, transportation and storage of CO 2, for
example, related to air emissions, use of water and solid waste generation420.

In the EU, environmental impact assessment requirements and the procedure are specified in the
EIA Directive. In accordance with that Directive, before consent (permit) for a project is given,
projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of their nature,
size or location must be made subject to an environmental impact assessment. Projects for which
the EIA is mandatory before a permit is granted include, amongst others: (a) pipelines with a
diameter of more than 800 and length of more than 40 km for transportation of CO2, including
associated booster stations (b) installations for capture of CO2 for the purposes of geological storage
from installation (c) where the total yearly capture of CO2 is 1.5 megatons or more (d) CO2 storage
sites. Other pipelines for the transport of CO2 streams (with a diameter of less than 800 and a length
of less than 40 km) as well as other installations for the capture of CO2 streams are subject to a
screening procedure. This means that for these installations an environmental impact assessment is
not obligatory and Member States may decide whether to make them subject to environmental
impact assessment or not. Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 2012), CCS
projects are not specifically listed in the regulation as requiring EIAs. However, an assessment may
be triggered through a review of the project as a discretionary activity. It is important to note that a
completed EIA does not mean that the project is approved. The EIA provides the regulator with the
data in order to make an informed decision that is in the public interest421. CEAA 2012 provides
opportunities for public participation throughout the environmental assessment process.
Cooperation and communication with Aboriginal peoples with respect to environmental assessment
is a key component of CEAA 2012. Only public projects require preparation of an EIS, but because
public projects include any activity financed, assisted, or regulated by a federal agency, many
"private" projects are considered public for the purposes of NEPA. Each federal agency excludes
some projects from the EIA process by its own procedures, because experience has shown that they
do not significantly affect the environment. For all other proposed actions the agency prepares a
preliminary assessment to determine whether an EIS is required. In the United States, the EIA is
prepared by an agency of the federal government. At Federal level, the EPBC Act provides an
integrated environmental assessment and approval process for developments of "national
environmental significance." This is not explicitly dealt with in the Australian Government's GGS
Act, but could apply to permitted activities under that Act422. In Victoria, the Environmental Effects
Act 1978 (VEE Act) governs the preparation of environmental impact assessments, or
"Environmental Effects Statements" (EES) as defined under that Act. Under the Act, the Minister
for Planning has discretion to determine whether an EES is required in respect of, relevant, public
works, any Ministerial decision or action, or any decision by a person or body under Victorian law.
If the Planning Minister determines that an EES is required, the responsibility for preparing it lies
with the project proponent. Once an EES is prepared, it is publicly displayed and no work can
proceed on the development until the Minister has assessed the EES. Even where an EES is not
required, an EIS may still be required under the VEE Act423.

leak detection and monitoring plan.

In Mexico, the Environmental Impact Evaluation is the process in which the corresponding
environmental authority (i.e. ASEA for the hydrocarbons’ sector and SEMARNAT for any other
industrial activity or construction works) reviews the information previously filed by the requesting
person, in order to evaluate the technical aspects of the project, applicable environmental legislation
and expected environmental impacts. If the environmental authority considers that the project
complies with the necessary requirements, it will grant an Environmental Impact Authorization,
which will normally provide further measures to promote the conservation of the environment and
avoid environmental damages or imbalances.

The Environmental Impact Authorization marks the successful conclusion of the Environmental
Impact Evaluation and is ideally granted within 60 business days from submission as required by
the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (“LGEEPA”). However,
the procedure may be suspended for as long as 60 additional days if the authority deems that further
information is required from the proponent of the project (investor). Also, the term may be extended
if the complexity of the project so requires. At the end, issuance of an EIA may take up to 180
business days.

 Gap 27
 In relation to the Environmental Impact Authorization for federal matters, CCUS activities are not
 listed as one of the activities that need an environmental impact authorization, which can be
 considered as a gap. However, if CCUS activities are related to any other activity regulated under
 federal environmental impact matters and as such can be considered as part of the regulated
 activities, then an environmental impact authorization will be necessary (i.e. hydrocarbon
 activities are regulated, hence EOR activities can be included in the regulation on environmental
 impact matters for hydrocarbon activities). Likewise, in the case where forestry vegetation is
 removed for the implementation of CCUS activities, an environmental impact authorization will
 be needed, which is a condition for obtaining a forestry land use change authorization.

In order to resolve the referred gap and also to avoid any interpretation by the competent authorities
whether CCUS activities are included as part of any other activity regulated under environmental
impact matters, then an amendment to the regulations on environmental impact matters will be
needed. This can be considered as a barrier since it necessitates the approval from the executive
branch of the Federal government and such approval can depend on several factors, such as political
agenda and internal procedures, which may take a considerable amount of time.

4.31 POLLUTION PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS (AIR, WATER)

The environmentally sound implementation of CCS projects is of major importance for the public
acceptance of CCS. Ensuring a high level of environmental protection from the risks posed by CO2
storage should be one of the main purposes of regulatory frameworks for CCS. As a consequence of
the authorization process for CCS activities and following the classification of CO2, existing
pollution prevention requirements might apply to the individual phases of a CCS project.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that existing industrial pollution control

                                                                                                   155
legislation could potentially cover (usually with some modifications) certain aspects of the CCS
chain.

One of the main purposes of the CCS Directive is to ensure a high level of protection of the
environment from the risks posed by CO2 storage. In this context, the EU legislation on the
protection of groundwater is particularly relevant. The Water Framework Directive allows for the
injection of CO2 into saline aquifers for storage purposes and any such injection is subject to the
provisions of EU legislation on the protection of groundwater. Also Member States are required to
take measures to prevent and limit input of pollutants into groundwater and prevent deterioration of
the status of all bodies of groundwater. With regard to the protection of marine waters, the
provisions of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are applicable. They require Member States
to take into account pressures and impacts of human activities on marine waters – that would also
cover activities related to CO2 transportation pipelines and offshore storage. With regard to the
protection of the ambient air, certain provisions of the CCS Directive are applicable. The
application for a storage permit must include a description of measures to prevent risks of leakages
as well as a proposed corrective measures’ plan. The IED, which is applicable to the capture of
CO2, requires that the application for the activity includes identification of significant effects of the
emissions on the environment and proposed technology for reducing the emissions, as well as
measures planned to monitor emissions into the environment and the main alternatives to the
proposed technology. A permit for CO2 capture must include all necessary measures to ensure that
all the appropriate preventive measures are taken against pollution and that no significant pollution
is caused and that the necessary measures are taken to prevent accidents and limit their
consequences. In addition, the EIA Directive requires that the environmental report prepared by the
developer must include measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce and, if possible, remedy
significant adverse effects on the environment. In Alberta, CCS environmental pollution is
regulated by the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) which prohibits the
release of a substance in an amount that may cause a significant adverse effect, especially in matters
of air contaminants, hazardous waste chemicals, ozone depleting substances, and water
contaminants. In the US, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) establishes
permit requirements for certain discharges from industrial sources, including storm water runoff
from an industrial facility or construction site and wastewater discharges to a municipal sewer
system. NPDES permits that cover existing facilities would likely have to be amended to account
for the impact of a CCS retrofit on a facility’s effluent discharges. In Victoria, the GGGS Act
makes provision in relation to that matter by, or under, the Dangerous Goods Act 1985, the
Environment Protection Act 1970, the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 or the Water Act
1989, the provision made by GGGS Act.

In Mexico, project-related pollution is overseen by SEMARNAT, for projects of confinement of
hazardous materials and waste, and ASEA, who will oversee the environmental conditions to
prevent contamination by waste generated by the activities of the sector, whose disposal may cause
salinization and excessive increases in organic loading in soils and water bodies in the sites where
such activities are carried out.

In terms of air, the Sole Environmental License is the instrument that aims to monitor emissions
into the atmosphere from different sources, of both CO2 emissions and other gases. This license
must be renewed every year through an Annual Operation Inventory, which is a report of the
different emissions generated by a certain facility on bi-monthly periods.

 Gap 28
 Pollution prevention of CCUS activities is partially regulated under Mexican legislation since
 CO2 is considered as an air emission and needs to comply with the obtainment of the Sole

                                                                                                     156
 Environmental License and, with the maximum permissible levels of contaminants enlisted in the
 competent Mexican Official Standards, by means of control methods. The latter can be
 considered as part of the CO2 capture activities. However, for use and storage activities there is no
 specific regulation with regard to pollution prevention unless CO2 can be considered as a
 hazardous waste or a waste that may generate damage to the environment, which can be
 considered as a gap.

 Likewise, ASEA has the authority to create regulations to prevent contamination generated by
 hydrocarbon activities in which CCUS activities, such as EOR, can be considered. However, such
 provisions have not been issued yet, which is also a gap.

In order to resolve the referred gaps, specific regulation for the pollution prevention of CCUS
activities needs to be created or an amendment to current legislation in order to consider CO2 as a
hazardous waste or a waste. This can be considered as a barrier since it will need the approval of the
Congress of Union for new legislation or modification to the existing one, or in case the
amendments are only considered for regulations or guidelines, the approval must be obtained from
the executive branch of the Federal government. Both procedures may depend on several external
factors such as political agenda or internal procedures that may take considerable time.

4.32 NATURE LEGISLATION REQUIREMENTS                                   (CONSIDERATION              OF      PROTECTED
     HABITATS AND SPECIES)

Nature legislation might establish important restrictions on the implementation of CCS projects,
including bans on large infrastructure projects in areas which could significantly affect protected
habitats or species. Nature legislation is, in many jurisdictions, an essential tool for the protection of
biodiversity and a wide range of requirements could be relevant for the consideration of CCS
projects.

Nature protection and the protection of natural habitats and species are also considered as an
important element of EIA reports for large infrastructure projects.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that EIA considerations regarding the sub-
surface shall include an effects’ assessment based on the sensitivity of particular species,
communities or habitats linked to potential leakages.

Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and
flora (Habitats Directive)424 forms the cornerstone of the EU’s nature conservation policy.
According to this Directive, each Member State must designate a network of protected areas called
the Natura 2000 network on its territory composed of special areas of conservation and Special
Protection Areas for birds covered by the Birds Directive. The Habitats Directive requires Member
States to take appropriate measures to avoid deterioration of natural habitats a nd the habitats’
species, as well as disturbance of the species hosted on the special areas of conservation. To this
end, all plans and projects not directly connected to the management of the protected site but likely
to have significant effect on the site (thus including CCS activities), must be subject to an
appropriate assessment of its implications for the site. Finally, those plans and projects likely to
have an effect on a Natura 2000 site should be subject to an appropriate assessment of their impacts
on the Natura 2000 site. Furthermore, strict systems of protection might require the assessment of
the activity on species’ protection. A CCS project would have specific authorizations on a case -by-
case basis in accordance with Alberta Wild Species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) enjoins the

424
      Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.

                                                                                                                        157
Federal government from taking any action that could jeopardize a listed endangered or threatened
species in the US, or destroy or adversely modify a critical habitat for such species 425. Furthermore,
Executive Order 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds,” requires
Federal agencies to avoid or minimize the negative impacts of their action on migratory birds, and
to take active steps to protect birds and their habitats426. Victoria has important areas with marine
mammal populations where these gather, breed and feed. Marine mammals are given special
protection under law in these areas to minimize disturbance and allow them the necessary space.

Limits and prohibitions for any infrastructure project will apply for CCUS projects as well, for there
is no specific CCUS regulation at the moment. In matters of habitat protection and wildlife, the
most important regulations are developed in the General Wildlife Act ( Ley General de Vida
Silvestre), Land-Use Programs and Ecological Management Programs.

In relation to forestry vegetation, the General Law for Sustainable Forestry Development (Ley
General para el Desarrollo Forestal Sustentable) includes the requirement of authorization for the
removal of forestry vegetation.

There is no specific regulation for CCUS activities in Mexico. However, such activities will be
regulated under obligations for infrastructure projects which have several limits and prohibitions in
matters of habitat protection and wild life (i.e. limited projects can be installed in Natural Protected
Areas depending on the considerations of the management plans). Since in Mexico the regulations
for protecting nature are general, CCUS activities may be included. In addition to the applicable
laws and regulations, there are also land use programs and ecological management or ordinance
programs which also regulate the type of economic activities that can be installed within the
territorial areas regulated in which CCUS activities can be included (i.e. industrial purposes).

In addition, forestry removal is regulated, not depending on the type of activity, but on the type of
vegetation to be removed. If the vegetation is considered as forestry, then an authorization must be
obtained, no matter which type of activity will be installed. Finally, there are restrictions that apply
to all types of activities in which CCUS activities are included (i.e. mangrove removal). CCUS
activities regulated under the Hydrocarbon sector have specific regulations for the protection of
habitats and species, such as the restriction to carry out this type of activity within Natural Protected
Areas.

Since CCUS activities are sufficiently regulated on matters of nature protection, we do not consider
the existence of gaps on this specific matter that need to be resolved by amending the current
legislation.

4.33 WASTE LEGISLATION REQUIREMENTS

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that regulatory issues associated with CO 2
capture and transport are generally likely to fall within the scope of existing regulatory frameworks
related to waste, with little or no modification to those existing frameworks.

CO2 is not considered as waste in the EU; hence waste legislation is not applicable. In Canada CO 2
is not a waste under the Waste Control Regulation. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

(RCRA) governs the disposal of solid and hazardous waste in the US427. “Hazardous waste” is
defined under the Act as a solid waste that poses a “substantial present or potential hazard to human
health when improperly treated, stored, transported or, disposed of, or otherwise managed”. Section
3001 of RCRA creates an exemption under the Act for waste generated through the combustion of
coal and other fossil fuels. It is unclear whether this exemption might be extended to include excess
waste generated by CO2 capture operations at a coal combustion facility. In Victoria, premises
capturing, separating, processing or storing waste carbon dioxide are regulated under the
Environment Protection (Scheduled Premises and Exemptions) Regulations 2007. Although the
term “ waste carbon dioxide” is not defined, the Environment Protection Act 1970 (Vic) only
defines “waste” to include any matter whether solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive which is
discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to
cause an alteration in the environment428. On this basis, carbon dioxide injected as part of a CCS
project is already classified as a waste under existing Victorian legislation. The effect of this is that
a CCS proponent will need to comply with relevant Victorian environmental law in undertaking
CCS operations, including the State Environment Protection Policy, which expressly prohibits the
direct discharge of wastes into any Victorian geological structure or formation containing or
capable of containing water, where “beneficial uses” are impacted upon429.

In Mexico, depending on the type of waste generated, the implementation of a Waste Management
Plan could be necessary. A Waste Management Plan is an instrument created to minimize waste
generation and evaluate hazardous waste, special management waste and solid urban waste.

Waste legislation in Mexico is very thorough, including for CCUS activities as it is the type and
amount of waste generated that is regulated instead of the type of activity that generates the waste.
The only activity that has specific regulations is the metallurgic industry since it generates
considerable amounts of hazardous waste.

Likewise any other waste not considered as hazardous is also regulated (i.e. special management
and urban solid wastes), and local and municipal authorities are in charge of its integral
management.

In conclusion, on matters of waste legislation requirements, we do not consider the existence of a
gap for CCUS activities as all possible wastes generated under such activities are currently
regulated by the applicable legislation.

4.34 COASTAL AND MARINE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS

The protection of coast and marine waters in the EU is regulated by the Marine Strategy Framework
Directive (MSFD)430. The MSFD is based on the ecosystem-based approach which focuses on the
relationship between human society and marine ecosystems in order to achieve and maintain good
environmental status of marine waters (as determined by the Member States), enable the sustainable
use of the sea and inform relevant management decisions. Each Member State must develop and

regularly update a marine strategy for its marine waters. No provisions related directly to CCS
activities are contained in the MSFD. However, the CCS Directive refers to a ‘water column’ which
means the vertically continuous mass of water from the surface to the bottom sediments of a water
body; the storage of CO2 in the water column shall not be permitted. In Canada, a CCS project
would require specific authorizations on a case by case basis in accordance with the Canada Marine
Act. In the US, while not subject to the UIC Program, injection wells, up to three miles offshore,
could become subject to regulation under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act
(MPRSA)431. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 implemented the 1996 Protocol
to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
1972 (London Protocol) into Australian law, prohibiting dumping of controlled materials into the
sea.

In Mexico, regulations and guidelines with regard to coastal and maritime protection derive from
the powers of SEMARNAT, PROFEPA, CONAGUA and ASEA. Superficial waters are regulated
under the General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection, which is applied
by SEMARNAT and PROFEPA in projects not related to the hydrocarbon sector and by ASEA if
the project involves the production or transport of Hydrocarbons. The federal maritime zone and
land gained from the sea are regulated under the General Law of National Assets (Ley General de
Bienes Nacionales) and its specific regulations on federal maritime zone matters and is applied by
SEMARNAT and PROFEPA in projects not related to the hydrocarbon sector and by ASEA if the
project involves the production or transport of Hydrocarbons. CONAGUA is the authority entitled
to regulate and control national waters and federal zones which consist, amongst others, of
superficial waters, underground aquifers, and the federal zone of the portion of rivers that has no
contact with the ocean.

Depending on the location of the Project, it should be adapted to the corresponding Maritime
Developing Program, which will include certain specification of the onshore and offshore locations,
as well as the feasibility requirements to build any infrastructure that may cause an impact on the
coastal area. This Maritime Developing Program will be taken into account to issue, or deny, the
corresponding Environmental Impact Authorization.

There are no specific regulations for CCUS activities that will be carried out within coastal land and
seas. Notwithstanding, there are provisions that regulate the installment of any type of infrastructure
in this area such as the Federal Maritime Zone and land gained to the sea regulations by which
CCUS activities will be obliged. For maritime areas there is a Maritime Developing Program that
regulates the installment of any type of infrastructure activity that may cause an impact to the zone
in which CCUS activities are included and for the pollution generation Mexico is part of the
London Protocol. Finally, for all projects to be installed in both areas, an environmental impact
authorization will be needed. We considered that there are enough regulations that may apply to
CCUS activities to be installed in coastal and marine areas. However, specific regulations for this
type of activity can be created in order to strengthen the regulations for this type of activity. The
creation of such regulations can be considered as a barrier, since the procedure for creating such
legal framework needs to comply with several requirements and also external factors may be
considered, such as political agenda. Such a procedure can be long and extensive which can also be
considered as a barrier.

4.35 COVERAGE BY GHG TRADING SCHEMES

In the context of setting up a regulatory framework for CCS, emissions’ accounting requirements

431
      Global CCS Institute, Report 3: Country Studies United States of America, ibid.

                                                                                                   160
(e.g. monitoring, reporting and verification) under emissions’ trading programs, shall be an area of
consideration when analyzing current regulations and industry operations to assess whether they
will already apply or whether they need to be modified.

The IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework states that in relation to liability for global effects, the
Model notes that incentive schemes for CCS are likely to create performance-based payments
linked to the amount of CO2 emissions avoided through a project. In the event of leakage, payments
should be adjusted accordingly. This can occur through different mechanisms, such as cap-and-
trade based emissions’ trading schemes or project based emissions’ trading schemes.

The EU emission trading system is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. The
system works on a ‘cap and trade’ basis. In the framework established by the ETS Directive, an EU
‘cap’ (limit) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by industries
(companies) in the system, and this amount is gradually reduced in order to ensure that the total
amount of emissions lowers over time. Within those limits, industries receive or buy emission
allowances and these can be traded between the companies when they will not be used, for example
due to the adoption of energy efficiency measures or carbon capture and storage. Each year the
companies must surrender enough allowances to cover their emissions, otherwise severe penalties
are imposed. Allowances not used in a given year may cover future needs. Alberta’s offset credit
(Alberta-Based Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program and Offset Credit System) system is a
compliance mechanism for entities regulated under the province’s mandatory GHG emission
intensity-based regulatory system. The tradable units in the Alberta offset system are referred to as
‘Alberta-based offset credits’ or Verified Emissions Reductions or Removals (VERRs) and are
measured in units of metric tons of CO2432. In the US there is currently no Federal-level mechanism
to impose a cost on GHG emissions. Instead, there are mandatory and voluntary cap-and-trade
programs. Examples of mandatory programs are the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),
which is integrated by the north-eastern states, and Western Climate Initiative. Meanwhile, Chicago
Climate Exchange, and American Carbon Registry are examples of voluntary programs. Numerous
US States have implemented their own mandatory GHG reporting rules433. The California Air
Resources Board, who manages the Californian cap-and-trade program, is currently developing a
quantification methodology for CCS which is expected to be adopted for use in the Cap-and-Trade
and Low Carbon Fuel Standard programs. Preparatory meetings on the accounting protocols as well
as technical discussions have taken place in the course of 2016.434 In Australia, the Carbon Pricing
Mechanism (CPM) was passed into law as part of the Clean Energy Futures Package (CEF) in
2011, but was repealed in July 2014 following a change in government.

Mexico is part of the Kyoto Protocol and also by means of the General Law on Climate Change and
other applicable regulations, has created a National market for trading carbon credits, which also
may be exchanged in other international markets and can also be used for tax benefits. Since CO 2 is
considered as a greenhouse emission, CCUS activities can be taking into consideration from the
generation of carbon credits which may be exchanged in any of the referred markets.

 Gap 29
 In matters of the Kyoto Protocol, at this point in time no methodology for CCUS activities exists
 Likewise, access to local or regional carbon markets is often hampered for the same reason. In
 Mexico, even though a regulatory framework for a national carbon market has been created, it is

 not yet fully implemented, nor operational. This can also be considered as a barrier since the
 national carbon credits do not have a competitive price in the market. Overall, there are thus
 important barriers for a carbon market incentive for the deployment of CCUS activities.

In order to resolve the aforementioned gap, a National market needs to be developed which could
take a significant amount of time which can be considered as a barrier.

4.36 PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH

The risks presented to human populations located in the vicinity of CO2 capture, transport and
storage facilities might, according to the IEA Model, be captured by extending the application of
any existing laws on civil protection and industrial facilities to cover CCS operations435. Also,
specific risk assessment procedures for CO2 storage sites linked to site selection and
characterization should assist in mitigating risks to human populations. It is important to carefully
assess the application of existing legal requirements aiming to protect human health and assess
whether these sufficiently comprehend the risks associated with CCS projects, in combination with
the specific requirements established for such projects.

The requirements concerning the protection of human health are scattered around the relevant
pieces of EU legislation, in particular the CCS Directive, the EIA Directive, the IED, as well as the
occupational health and safety legislation. The CCS Directive states that CO2 must be stored in such
a way as to eliminate negative effects and risks to the environment and human health. In case of
leakages from a storage site, the operator must take the necessary measures to ensure the protection
of human health. In accordance with the EIA Directive, an environmental impact assessment must
examine the effects of the planned project on, inter alia, human beings. Similarly, under the SEA
Directive, an environmental report must analyse the likely significant effects of a planned plan or
program on human health. In Alberta, the AER Directive 071 outlines the requirements for a
corporate-level emergency response plan (ERP) and stipulates that these plans must have pre-
planned procedures that will aid in effective response to an emergency. An ERP for a CCS project
does not currently require approval from the regulator. However, the regulator may review the ERP
upon request. An emergency planning zone (EPZ) is a geographical area surrounding a well,
pipeline or facility containing a hazardous product that requires specific emergency response
planning by the licensee. The licensee is required to carry out notification and education for the
public that lives within the EPZ. In the US, an owner or operator may always be subject to an order
the USEPA deems necessary to protect the health of persons under SDWA after site closure, if there
is fluid migration that causes or threatens imminent and substantial endangerment to a USDW.
There are no specific requirements about protecting human health and CCS projects. However,
Australia has general civil protection requirements which could apply to any emergencies related to
CCS projects with a view to protecting human health.

In matters of human health, all industrial activities in Mexico are regulated by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Welfare. Likewise, due to the Mexican Energy Reform, activities related to
Hydrocarbons will be regulated by ASEA who, as of today, has not issued any regulations. There is
a General Law with its corresponding regulations on Safety, Hygiene and Work Environment which
states the obligations companies need to comply with in regard to human health. There are also
several Mexican Official Standards that establish the technical procedures for protecting personnel
in order to avoid possible accidents at work or sickness.



435
      IEA Model Regulatory Framework, page 39.

                                                                                                  162
 Gap 30
 Since CCUS activities have not been established in Mexico (other than those related to EOR),
 there are no specific regulations, such as Mexican Official Standards that foresee all technical
 requirements to be complied with in order to protect human health, but only in case technical
 specific requirements for such activities are needed and are not included in current regulations. If
 that is the case, then there is a gap which needs to be resolved by creating specific Mexican
 Official Standards for which procedure needs to be followed. This can be considered as a barrier
 since several steps need to be achieved and a considerable amount of time may be needed.

 Likewise, until specific provisions for the hydrocarbon sector are created by ASEA for protecting
 human health, there is a gap in any CUS activity related with such a sector. Hence, in order to
 resolve the gap, regulations from ASEA need to be issued. This can be considered as a barrier
 since it could take a reasonable amount of time.


4.37 PROTECTING WORKERS SAFETY

CO2 capture, transport and storage should be operated in a manner that ensures workers are
protected from the effects of any CO2 releases436.

The EU has developed a very extensive and stringent occupational health and safety (OSH) legal
and policy framework437. No specific OSH legislation related only to CCS activities exists, besides
Article 8 of the CCS Directive which merely requires that the storage permit can be issued only
when professional and technical development and training of the operator and all staff are provided.
Under the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation (OHSR) of Canada, a harmful substance is
defined as a substance that, because of its properties, application or presence, creates or could create
a danger, including a chemical or biological hazard to the health and safety of a worker exposed to
it. CO2 could be captured under the legislation of harmful substances438. Although CO2 is an
asphyxiate at high concentrations and can harm human health and the environment, it is benign at
lower concentration and is regularly handled as part of many different industrial activities. As such,
there are standards already established for CO2 exposure and handling in the US. Occupational
hazards can be minimized when workers adhere to safety standards and use appropriate protective
equipment. There are no specific requirements in Australia for protecting workers´ safety in CCS
projects. Victoria has an Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 containing general occupational
health and safety requirements.

Please refer to the conclusions pointed out in section 36, since such conclusions encompass human
health and workers’ safety matters related to CCUS activities.

4.38 SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE THROUGH DEMONSTRATION PHASE

The IEA Model Regulatory Framework notes that, in most countries, CCS is entering a phase of
technological demonstration with a view to moving towards full-scale deployment. As such,
countries may wish to develop demonstration frameworks and overall demonstration strategies.
These can show the technical potential for CCS deployment in a country, assess storage capacity
using international best practice methodologies to enable comparison of estimates, highlight which

technologies are most promising and which ones are suited to the circumstances of the country in
question, provide incentives and financing as well as build public understanding and confidence in
CCS.

In the EU, and in accordance with Article 27 of the CCS Directive, every three years Member
States must submit to the European Commission a report on the implementation of the Directive
and the Commission must organize an exchange of information between the competent authorities
of the Member States. The first report was adopted in February 2014439. In addition, an Information
Exchange Group has been created to arrange an exchange of information between the competent
authorities of the Member States and to promote a coherent implementation of the CCS Directive
across Member States. The requirements of the four funded projects in the Alberta Province serve
as the main driver behind knowledge-sharing mechanisms. The Government of Alberta holds the
position that a consistent approach is needed to be able to use the resulting knowledge, which
means that data from various projects with similar technology blocks must be comparable440. The
US has significant knowledge-sharing initiatives through the National Energy Technology
Laboratory (NETL), which is an agency of the USDOE. NETL focuses on the energy portfolio,
including CCS. The Australian Government Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has
detailed knowledge-sharing arrangements for projects as part of the initial funding for the pre-
feasibility studies441. The Global CCS Institute knowledge-sharing framework has been used as the
basis for this work, although not all of the possible knowledge categories were used. To date,
supported projects have agreed to contribute to project factsheets, knowledge-sharing reports as
well as providing knowledge-sharing personnel. The projects are receptive to knowledge sharing,
but within the boundaries of protection of specified intellectual property.

 Gap 31
 Since no CCUS activities have been developed in Mexico, there is no information that, as of
 today, could be useful for sharing knowledge on National projects on this type of activities, which
 is considered as a gap. However, international information can be used in order to understand this
 type of project even though no activities have yet been developed in Mexico.

It is important to mention that some governmental agencies are currently working on developing a
CCUS investigation Centre which will have as one of its objectives the investigation and
dissemination of knowledge. Likewise, there is a general framework in some legislation that
establishes obligations to the authorities to promote, investigate, educate and disseminate
knowledge with regard to climate change mitigation activities in which CCUS activities can be
included. Finally, the Federal government is working with federal entities in order to update the
National Atlas for CCUS activities related to the geological sites that may be suitable for this type
of activity and there is also the idea of updating the North American Carbon Storage Atlas between
Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. In order to resolve the aforementioned gap, all of these ideas must be
generated and issued which can be considered as a barrier due to many factors such as the amount
of time that will be needed, political agenda and international negotiations, amongst others.

5    PRIORITIZATION OF GAPS AND BARRIERS


The following table provides a prioritization of gaps and barriers in the Mexican regulatory
framework. The table thus aims at providing an overview of all the necessary legal and regulatory
requirements for CCUS deployment (both technology and activities) in Mexico categorizing them
according to their urgency in the current Mexican context. For the prioritization, first, a set of
criteria were developed which are applied to the gaps and barriers identified in Mexico. Secondly,
the table presents the prioritization in function of the type of project and the urgency associated with
the time scale.

For the latter, we specifically consider the CCUS scenarios developed in the Mexican CCUS
Roadmap and currently under development:
    (i)     The operation of two small-scale CO2 capture and injection/storage pilot projects
            scheduled for the 2016-2020 timeframe; and
    (ii)    The deployment of multiple demonstration and commercial-scale CCUS projects
            anticipated to occur after 2020.

Box. Brief introduction to the pilot projects in Mexico as presented in the 2014 Roadmap and
the Terms of Reference for the study

The CO2 Capture Pilot Plant Project
The Mexican CCUS Roadmap includes as a key first step the construction and operation of a CO2 capture
pilot plant at the Poza Rica natural gas-fired, combined-cycle generating station in the state of Veracruz,
Mexico. The objectives of this project, scheduled to commence in 2016, are to demonstrate the feasibility and
potential of CO2 capture from gas-fired power plants under Mexican conditions, build human capacity and
experience in CO2 capture technologies, provide an indicative measure of CO2 capture costs in Mexico, and
use the pilot plant as a platform for legal and regulatory development.

The CO2-Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Pilot project
On the storage side, the Mexican state oil company PEMEX is embarking on a CO 2-EOR pilot project at its
Cinco Presidentes assets, located on the border of the states of Veracruz and Tabasco, and plans to start
injecting CO2 in 2016 to improve oil production, with the CO2 coming from a nearby ammonia plant.
While CO2-EOR projects are not generally considered storage projects, the implementation of certain
enhanced monitoring protocols may enable CO2-EOR projects to qualify as permanent storage projects.
Implementing such enhanced monitoring protocols in Mexico will ensure that the net amount of CO2 injected
and stored is counted towards the country’s emission reduction targets and enable the generation of verified
CO2 emission reduction units, potentially eligible for national and/or international use.

CCUS Demonstration and Deployment
Following the successful development and operation of the CO 2 capture and storage pilot projects, the
Roadmap envisages large-scale demonstration and commercial-scale deployment of CCUS after 2020.




The table thus attempts at providing an oversight of the most urgent regulatory changes needed in
view of the deployment of the two pilot projects, while allowing suggestions to be made for further
improvements to the regulatory framework for the deployment of demonstration and commercial-
scale projects after 2020.

                                                                                                         165
A two-level classification system is used for the prioritization for the gaps and barriers according to
their urgency and priority level to be addressed with a view to provide the regulatory framework
necessary for CCUS activities in Mexico. Gaps and barriers identified by the highest priority level
are the most urgent regulatory priorities, while those identified with lower priority level are less
urgent priorities.

A second step in the classification system distinguishes between those priorities that are priorities
for the pilot projects and priorities for future storage operations outside of the hydrocarbons’ sector.
This allows us to clearly identify those regulatory changes that are necessary in the short term and
changes that are needed for the medium to long term.

The following criteria were used to allocate the gaps and barriers to the different regulatory priority
categories mentioned above. They are applied as part of the first-level classification with a view to
identifying regulatory priorities for the Mexican framework.

    1.      Essential nature of the gap or barrier for project implementation

The first criterion to be considered relates to the main objective of the project: analyzing the legal
and regulatory framework in order to assess the existing requirements or regulatory gaps that may
act as essential barriers for the implementation of two specific CCUS projects planned to be
developed in Mexico in the near future as well as further demonstration projects at a later stage.
This criterion will include the status of the regulatory framework in Mexico compared to a priority
list of legal and regulatory requirements or measures defined on the basis of international best
practices.

    2.      Timeline for regulatory changes

Another criterion would relate to the timeframe required for regulatory changes. The
recommendations presented in this project will be organized according to their timeline in relation
to the regulatory changes or processes required. From measures that can be put in place relatively
quickly and therefore might not undergo legislative procedures, to measures that would necessarily
involve amendments to existing legislation or proposals for new legislative acts.

    3.      Compatibility with current regulations

This criterion aims at taking into account whether existing legal or regulatory measures could be
applicable and will require minor changes to these regulations/will require major changes to these
regulations or whether a new regulatory framework for CCUS is needed.

    4.      Presence of the necessary institutional capacity and allocation of responsibilities

The assessment of gaps and barriers will also consider the presence of the necessary institutional
framework for the implementation of CCUS activities and the allocation of responsibilities. The
readiness of the institutional framework to deal with the responsibilities associated with CCUS
activities will be considered a priority issue. Eg. clear allocation of monitoring responsibilities and
institutional capacity for verification.

    5.      Regulatory changes which are required to ensure public participation and acceptance of
            CCUS activities


                                                                                                    166
Finally, the adequateness of the legal framework to ensure public participation or buy-in of the
public will be considered for prioritization given the importance of ensuring public acceptance for
the successful development of these activities/projects.

    6.      Impact on public safety of CCUS projects

This criterion is based on the acknowledgement that the legal and regulatory framework needs to
ensure public safety. The specific measures required will be assessed in relation to whether they
will increase public safety/will not affect public safety/will compromise public safety.

    7.      Impact on environmental protection of CCUS projects

This environmental protection requirement under national and international rules is essential for the
successful development of CCUS projects or activities. Each of the gaps and barriers analysed will
be assessed in relation to whether they will encourage timely environmental permitting/will cause
delays to environmental permitting/will prevent CCUS projects from complying with environmental
regulations.

The second-level classification applies a time-related criterion to those aspects that have been
identified as priorities, with a view to distinguishing between the regulatory priorities for the pilot
projects and those for future demonstration and commercial-scale CCUS projects.

    1.      Timeline for project implementation

It is expected that a major factor for the prioritization of regulatory issues will be the timeline for
the gradual implementation of CCUS activities in Mexico. This will cover the type of project and
stage of CCUS implementation, namely whether the regulatory issue is relevant for pilot projects,
demonstration projects or commercial-scale projects. Priority will be given to pilot projects which
are expected to potentially start in 2016.

For the first-level prioritization, a score was given to the gaps and barriers identified in the course of
the project. Those gaps and barriers identified as priorities have then been given a Category 1 or 2
level, depending on the type of project for which amendments to the regulatory framework are
needed. A Category 1 priority has been given to those gaps and barriers that require amending for
the pilot projects to take place. A Category 2 priority identifies those regulatory changes that are
necessary for future CCUS projects.

The following table presents the scores awarded to the gaps and barriers identified in the previous
chapter.

    A low score has been given to those gaps for which a constitutional amendment may be appropriate, a medium score for changes to legislation, a high score for regulatory
changes which may take place through regulatory measures.
443
    A low score has been given to those gaps for which there is little institutional capacity, a high score for available institutional capacity. A medium score has been given to those
gaps where institutional capacity varies according to the institutions involved.

The issues identified with a score higher than 50 are considered priority issues for the regulatory framework in Mexico. Gaps with a score of less
than 50 are considered non-priority gaps.

In the following table, a detailed presentation is provided of the gaps and barriers identified in the framework of this study. The table provides
information about the regulatory context for the gap or barrier as well as any associated regulatory challenges. Moreover, the table explains the
application of the prioritization criteria. Finally, a prioritization category is provided, based on the following premises:

Category 1: priority for the pilot projects as currently under development in Mexico, namely a capture project at the Poza Rica natural gas
combined-cycle generating station and CO2-Enhanced Recovery Project (CO2-EOR) project in the hydrocarbons’ sector.

Category 2: priority for future CCUS projects, outside of the hydrocarbons’ sector.

Category 3: non-priority issues on the basis of the scorecard included above. Such issues may be regulated in the future, but are not considered
regulatory priorities at this point in time.

6     RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS                               TO     THE     REGULATORY
      FRAMEWORK FOR CCUS IN MEXICO


On the basis of the gaps and barriers identified in Chapter 4 of this report and the prioritization of
such gaps and barriers in view of the Mexican legal context, this chapter will present
recommendations for changes to be made to the existing Mexican regulatory framework in order to
facilitate the implementation of CCUS.

The development of recommendations is structured around the main categories of key issues used
throughout this report. Recommendations therefore distinguish between the regulatory aspects of
capture activities, transport, storage and several overarching regulatory issues relevant to all of
these activities that are part of the CCUS chain. The organization of recommendations in
accordance with these types of activities follows the nature of the regulatory framework in Mexico
and in other jurisdictions. Capture, transport and storage are often regulated in separate legal
instruments, though cross-referring to each other.

The gap and barrier analysis and associated prioritization showed there is an important distinction to
be made in the Mexican regulatory framework between those CCUS activities that will take place in
or are related to the hydrocarbons sector and activities outside of this sector. The distinction is
particularly relevant for Mexico as activities in the hydrocarbons sector are regulated differently
from those in other areas such as aquifers or depleted mines.

There is currently no regulatory framework for CCUS specifically in Mexico. However, the revised
Hydrocarbons Law provides the Mexican Agency for Industrial Security, Energy and the
Environment (ASEA) with the authority to regulate the generation, capture, transportation and
storage of CO2 within the hydrocarbons sector. No such legal basis currently exists for other CCUS
activities outside of this sector. However, certain other aspects of CCUS activities, such as those
related to the capture of CO2, could be covered by existing regulation. Also, consideration could be
given to modify existing legislation with a view to explicitly include CCUS activities within their
scope.

In this chapter, we will present recommendations as to how to amend the regulatory framework for
CCUS activities in Mexico with a view to allow for the deployment of such activities in Mexico in a
sound manner. The recommendations make clear distinctions between the broad regulatory topics
and provide suggestions for amending existing legal requirements or for the development of new
instruments, mostly in the form of regulations or guidelines.

The initial outline for these recommendations was presented during the stakeholder workshop held
in Mexico City on September 24th 2015. While most stakeholders agreed on the approach towards
regulating capture and transport, different views were expressed in relation to the regulation of
storage activities, especially outside of the hydrocarbons sector. Also in relation to property rights,
different opinions were expressed by stakeholders. These opinions are reflected where relevant.


6.1   GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATORY
      FRAMEWORK IN RELATION TO CCUS

The incorporation of CCUS activities in the Mexican legal framework, from an environmental and
natural resources protection perspective, requires a number of adjustments. These range from
changes in legislation for projects that have to be developed in the long term according to specific

                                                                                                   218
technical provisions, referred to as NOMs (Normas oficiales mexicanas). Several of these
recommendations are of an overarching nature. Aspects not specifically related to either capture,
transport or storage will be presented in this subsection.

6.1.1   Classification of CO2

The first aspect of an overarching nature relates to the classification of CO 2. As seen in the review
of international best practices, the classification of CO2 most often relates to a specific activity of
the CCUS chain. In Mexico, there is currently no classification of CO2 specifically for CCUS.
Nevertheless, similarly to other jurisdictions, possibly relevant classifications have been identified
in the gap and barrier analysis. The classification of CO2 for CCUS activities is important in order
to determine the application of existing legal requirements in a jurisdiction.

In Mexico, CO2 is considered as an air emission and thus covered by existing legislation on air
pollution relevant in the context of capture and as a GHG relevant to climate change-related aspects
of CCUS. Nevertheless, amendments are required to include CO2 for the purpose of CCUS in the
regulatory framework in relation to use, pipeline transportation and storage purposes. This might be
done through a classification as ´waste´ or even ´hazardous waste´, as will be explained below in
the corresponding sections, or through the application of relevant legislation to CO2 specifically. In
relation to the hydrocarbons sector, this can be addressed by means of guidelines to be issued by
ASEA. The legal basis established in the Hydrocarbons Law allows for the adoption of guidelines
for regulating CCUS activities in this sector. Outside of this sector, amendments will have to be
made to legislation. This is particularly the case for CO2 storage in saline aquifers or in depleted
mines. The classification of CO2 in this case, either as a ´waste´, ´hazardous waste´, ´commodity´ or
as CO2 itself will be an inherent part of the wider regulatory framework established for such
activities and shall be integrated there. Several possible legal frameworks will be discussed as part
of the recommendations on the activities as a whole.

During the discussions held at the stakeholder workshop in Mexico City in September 2015, a wide
range of opinions were expressed for and against the proposed classifications of CO2. Participants in
a discussion group on storage and the hydrocarbons sector generally favored the classification of
CO2 as a hazardous waste (i.e. as part of a mixture with hazardous waste in very low
concentrations) and the use of the existing regulatory framework for such substances. However,
participants in discussion groups on environmental protection requirements and capture rejected this
option and clearly favored the development of a specific regulatory framework for CCUS activities.
It should be noted that the classification for storage activities outside of the hydrocarbons sector,
where this particular classification is mostly relevant, does not consider the pilot projects currently
envisaged in Mexico, but longer-term demonstration and commercial-scale projects.

6.1.2   Environmental protection requirements

In addition to the classification of CO2, CCUS activities might have to be explicitly included in
existing environmental legislation with a view to extend the scope of such provisions to CCUS
activities. This is particularly so for the work or activities subject to an environmental impact
assessment as regulated in the General Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental
Protection (LGEEPA). CCUS activities are currently not listed as one of the activities that require
an environmental impact authorization. When the activities are related to other activities that do
require such an authorization, the impacts of CCUS activities will be considered as part of such
activities (e.g. hydrocarbon activities or where forestry vegetation is removed). However, for
activities not under the umbrella of a federally regulated activity subject to an environmental impact
evaluation, the LGEEPA will require amending. Similarly, where under State authority, the activity

                                                                                                   219
will need to be regulated by State environmental laws.

Pollution prevention requirements currently only apply in relation to capture activities. Moreover,
while ASEA has the authority to establish pollution prevention requirements for activities in the
hydrocarbon sector, no such provisions have yet been issued. It is recommended, based on the
review of international best practices and on the nature of the activities concerned, that pollution
prevention requirements be established applicable to all activities of the CCUS chain. This would
require the adoption of ASEA guidelines, which would establish pollution prevention requirements
in relation to the activities in the hydrocarbons sector and amendments to state and federal
legislation on pollution prevention for CCUS activities. In relation to permanent storage, one
particular regulatory option would involve the classification of CO2 as a hazardous waste, which
would apply existing pollution prevention requirements to such activities. Otherwise, specific
legislative requirements and implementing provisions may need to be developed. In view of the
pilot projects currently envisaged in Mexico, the adoption of ASEA Guidelines would ensure the
pilot projects are covered, either through existing legislation for the capture phase of the projects or
through the guidelines for the transport, use and storage phase.

Finally, in the specific circumstances where CCUS activities would be envisaged in fragile
ecosystems under protected status, such as mangroves, limitations to the activities may exist. This is
similar to the situation in all other jurisdictions investigated as part of this study and no particular
recommendations to modify the regulatory framework would therefore be recommended. However,
in cases where CCUS activities would take place in sensitive areas where no such restrictions exist,
the same recommendation as above applies in relation to the environmental impact authorization, in
particular where such areas render environmental services.

6.1.3    Creating incentives for the development of CCUS activities in Mexico as part of
         climate mitigation strategies

Deploying CCUS technology presents important costs for businesses. As a consequence, there is a
shared understanding among policy makers that incentives are needed for operators to engage in
CCS deployment. While certain operations such as EOR may make part of the CCUS chain more
profitable, it is considered that a lack of incentives and poor long-term economic perspectives are
the most important obstacles to the deployment of CCUS projects, in particular those involving
permanent storage.

While certain incentives for climate change mitigation might act as incentives for CCUS in Mexico,
important gaps have been identified in the existing Mexican regulatory framework. The Mexican
Law on climate change establishes, for instance, a framework for a carbon market. However, the
market in its current form is not yet fully operational. Access to foreign carbon markets or the CDM
is often complex due to practical constraints, such as the absence of a methodology for CCUS
projects under the current CDM. It is expected that more clarity will be provided by the Conference
of the Parties to the UNFCCC at the end of December 2015 and the anticipated successor agreement
of the Kyoto Protocol, at least in relation to international carbon mechanisms. 445 Moreover, in
Mexico, there is currently no mandatory emission reduction target or emission limitation for CO2 in
high-emitting sectors.

The IEA, in its CCS Model Regulatory Framework, recommends the following types of incentive

   It is worth noting in this context that China has prepared a Roadmap for CCS in the run-up to COP21. Published by the
Asian Development Bank in November 2015, http://www.adb.org/publications/roadmap-carbon-capture-and-storage-

                                                                                                                   220
frameworks that can be considered in Mexico with a view to provide the necessary incentives for
CCUS projects. These include carbon taxes per metric ton of CO2 emitted, cap-and-trade based
emissions trading, project-based mechanisms, feed-in tariffs and product-based incentives for
products with a lower emissions inventory compared to other similar products, emission
performance standards for emissions per unit output and, finally, technology mandates imposed on
operators undertaking CCUS activities. Any of these incentives are considered potential regulatory
options for Mexico, with some being under development and likely to take shape once an
international agreement has been reached in Paris at the end of 2015. Participants in the stakeholder
workshop in Mexico City on 24 September 2015 noted that initiatives, such as emission limitations
and the further development of the Mexican carbon market, are being developed. However, the
outcomes of Paris are expected to further define the way forward for the development of proposals.

6.1.4    Engaging the public in decision-making

It is highlighted by the IEA that engaging the public in decision-making on CCUS activities might
be vital in ensuring that a project can proceed. The IEA notes that it is important to inform the
public about the associated risks and benefits of such projects. As seen in the analysis of
international best practices, all jurisdictions included in this study incorporate providing information
and consultation with the public in relation to such activities. This has been considered particularly
important as it will help to provide long-term perspectives to potential investors in the activities.

There are four mechanisms for engaging the public in decision-making in Mexico that could apply
to CCUS activities, either as part of the environmental impact assessment for projects to be
developed in the hydrocarbons sector or for projects in areas considered as common use land. These
would, however, only cover part of the CCUS projects. For ensuring public participation in most
CCUS activities, a change to the LGEEPA would be the recommended way forward, in conjunction
with the extension of the requirements for environmental impact assessments for CCUS activities.

Box 4. General recommendations for the regulatory framework for CCUS in Mexico

1. Classification of CO2
     Classification of CO2 with regard to the specific CCUS activity is recommended as an integral part
        of the broader legal framework established for the regulation of such activities. This can either be as
        a ´waste´, ´hazardous waste´, ´commodity´ or as CO 2 gas for the purpose of CCUS activities. The
        classification will determine the scope of applicable regulatory requirements.
2. Environmental protection
     It is recommended to amend the LGEEPA or State environmental laws, where appropriate, with a
        view to ensure the application of the requirements for an environmental impact assessment to all
        CCUS activities.
     The adoption of ASEA Guidelines with pollution prevention requirements for CCUS activities, in
        particular, transport, use and storage in the hydrocarbons sector, would ensure the necessary legal
        protection from an environmental point of view for the pilot projects currently envisaged in Mexico.
        In the longer term, it is recommended to expand the scope of existing requirements on pollution
        prevention or to establish new requirements to adequately cover the environmental risks of CCUS
        activities.
3. Incentives for the development of CCUS activities
     In view of the costs associated with the deployment of CCS activities, it is recommended that
        Mexico develop long-term incentives for such activities as part of its climate mitigation strategy.
        Several options can be considered in this respect as highlighted above.
4. Engaging the public in decision-making
     The extension of the scope of the LGEEPA to include CCUS activities under the requirements for


                                                                                                            221
        an environmental impact authorization, as recommended above, would ensure public consultation
        processes for those same activities.




6.2   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN
      RELATION TO CAPTURE

There is currently no explicit authorization procedure for CO2 capture activities in Mexico.
Nevertheless, a sole environmental license is required under the LGEEPA for all stationary
industrial facilities. Such license would cover CO2 capture aspects as part of the general permitting
requirements for such installations, for instance, for electricity plants. Existing plants, which already
have a sole environmental license would not be required to obtain a new license as the conditions
for requiring a new license are an increase in emissions or a change in the generating process. This
is not considered problematic as the implementation of CO2 capture technologies would still be
subject to overall sectoral requirements applicable to the installation, for example, in relation to
environmental protection and safety.

However, since the Energy Reform, ASEA has been awarded the regulatory authority for CCUS
activities in relation to the hydrocarbons sector. While mostly related to the issues of transportation,
use and storage, the legal basis would also, through its broad mandate, cover the capture of CO2
within the hydrocarbons sector, for instance in refineries or petrochemical installations. It is,
therefore, recommended that ASEA regulate the authorization of capture activities in such
installations as part of the CCUS guidelines it will adopt. The regulation of such activities is not
relevant for the pilot project currently envisaged in Mexico, as the capture project would take place
at an electricity plant operated by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE).

Moreover, not all installations subject to a sole environmental license are required to monitor and
report on their emissions. The monitoring and reporting requirements ultimately depend on whether
an installation is considered a source under federal or local jurisdiction. Monitoring requirements
under the General Law on Climate Change, which would be applicable to installations proceeding
with the capture of CO2 emissions, currently only cover installations generating more than 25,000
metric tons of CO2. It is, therefore, recommended to amend the monitoring requirements of the
General Law on Climate Change, as established in the Regulation on the emissions inventory, and
extend their scope to installations emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2. This would ensure a
coherent approach to the monitoring requirements for all industrial installations proceeding with the
capture of CO2.

For capture activities specifically related to the hydrocarbons sector, MRV requirements for new
installations will need to be developed by ASEA in the form of guidelines.

In relation to inspections of industrial installations, the Energy Reform has provided ASEA with the
competence for issuing regulations and the implementation of inspections in relation to the
hydrocarbons sector. Similarly to the above issues, specific guidelines will be required to cover
these aspects in relation to capture activities in industrial plants in this sector, such as refineries or
petrochemical plants.

CO2 capture
    1. It is recommended that guidelines be adopted by ASEA for regulating several aspects of CCUS


                                                                                                      222
            activities in relation to the hydrocarbons sector, including the authorization for the capture of CO 2
            in, for instance, refineries or petrochemical installations, as well as monitoring and reporting of
            emissions and inspections in these same installations.
      2.    It is recommended to extend the scope of the Regulation on the emissions inventory for GHG
            emissions to installations emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 with a view to provide one
            comprehensive regulatory framework for all installations implementing CCUS activities.
            Alternatively or additionally, amendments may need to be considered to monitor and report
            requirements for industrial emissions as a whole. Consideration should be given to the integration of
            the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions as part of the national emissions inventory with
            reporting requirements applicable to industrial installations with a view to achieve greater coherence
            and reduce administrative burden upon operators.


6.3        RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN
           RELATION TO TRANSPORT

There is currently no specific regulation for CO2 transport either via pipeline, road, railroad or sea
transport. However, existing regulations for the transport of natural gas via pipelines and for the
transport of materials, hazardous materials and hazardous waste via other means of transport, could
be amended or serve as an example for the broad regulatory framework for CO2 transport. It is
recommended that specific operational conditions for the transport of CO2, such as temperature or
volume requirements as well as monitoring requirements be adopted by means of implementing
regulations as has been done in other jurisdictions.

The regulation of CO2 in relation to the hydrocarbons sector would, similarly to the above, be a
competence of ASEA since the Energy Reform. As a consequence, the authorization for transport of
CO2 can be regulated by ASEA in the guidelines for CCUS activities in the hydrocarbons sector.

Finally, it should be noted that construction authorizations for pipeline infrastructure are issued by
municipal authorities. It is not expected that any changes to the regulatory framework would be
needed to authorize the construction of CO2 pipelines specifically.

Box 6. Recommendations for the regulatory framework for CCUS in Mexico in relation to transport

CO2 transport
    1. It is recommended that guidelines be adopted by ASEA regulating several aspects of CCUS
        activities in relation to the hydrocarbons sector, including the authorization for the transport of CO 2
        via pipelines.
    2. Operational requirements for the transport of CO 2 should be adopted by means of implementing
        regulations. These should cover, among others, issues such as the allowed volume and temperature
        of CO2 for pipeline transportation. Similarly, operational conditions shall be adopted for the
        transport of CO2 via other means of transport, such as road transport or transport at sea. To enable
        the adoption of such operational conditions, a legal basis shall be provided in legislation. A legal
        basis can be established either by means of an extension of existing legislation for similar
        transportation activities, such as for natural gas or the transportation of materials or hazardous
        substances, or by means of a specific provision tailored to the transport of CO 2.




6.4        RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN
           RELATION TO USE AND STORAGE IN THE HYDROCARBONS SECTOR

The purpose of the current recommendation is to find suitable solutions for the existing legal

                                                                                                               223
framework in order for CCUS activities and, in particular, the pilot projects to be regulated in
Mexico, by using the current legislation, creating a new legislation, or by amending the existing
one. In this context, it should be noted that, perhaps the most relevant issue regarding the
implementation of the pilot projects is the storage of the CO2, in particular long-term storage.

The long-term storage issue could be dealt with by means of a recommendation prepared for the
stakeholder workshop held in Mexico, which proposed the treatment of CO2 as a hazardous waste.
Primarily because the mixture of a hazardous waste (irrespective of the amount) with any other
material would render such material a hazardous waste and consequently be subject to regulations
on hazardous wastes. Such treatment would have the following advantages: (i) it would require no
modifications of federal environmental impact matters as LGEEPA article 28 currently includes the
obligation to go through the environmental impact evaluation for hazardous waste confinements;
(ii) the General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes (LGPGIR), its
Regulations and Official Mexican Standard NOM-145-SEMARNAT-2003 already include the
possibility to confine hazardous wastes in geologically stable sites; (iii) there are mechanisms
already in place in the aforementioned law for the monitoring and verification of such site
confinements; (iv) SEMARNAT must issue a specific permit (apart from the environmental impact
authorization) for the confinement of hazardous wastes. However, certain issues were raised by
SEMARNAT in the workshop, in particular regarding the reaction of the general public and NGOs
in considering CO2 as a hazardous waste and the administrative burden comprised in the LGPGIR,
which project developers would have to comply with.

In view of the above, and in case is decided not to consider CO2 as a hazardous waste, a second
option may be considered for the storage of CO2 making use of the regulatory framework that is
currently in place. The existing regulatory framework provides that ASEA is entitled to regulate the
activities of capture, exploration, extraction, transport and industrial injection of CO2, for the
purpose of enhanced oil recovery. As such, for the purposes of regulating storage activities in the
hydrocarbon sector in case, we recommend that ASEA regulate temporary storage activities. Article
5, section XIX of the ASEA act includes “industrial injection of carbon dioxide” as part of the
activities that ASEA is entitled to regulate. Therefore, if ASEA can allow the injection of CO2 into
the sub-surface, then it is also allowing its temporary storage, as CO2 does not immediately escape
the subsurface.

Having temporary storage regulation under ASEA´s authority would still render certain issues
unattended for the hydrocarbon sector: firstly some aspects of permanent storage; and secondly
long-term liability.

Acting under the Constitutional provision that states that the Nation has the original property of the
land (and subsurface), a law would have to be amended or a new law created that entitles a specific
authority to grant to a particular (or public entity) the long-term use of the subsurface where the
CO2 is being permanently stored. As the issue is essentially one of environmental protection or
greenhouse gas reduction, we would suggest that SEMARNAT be granted with the entitlement to
permit the long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO2 storage. As environmental
matters have as a general framework the LGEEPA (with numerous exceptions), which has
provisions for the three levels of government, we would suggest the amendment of the LGEEPA to
include a new chapter on CCUS activities, including long-term storage and the corresponding
regulations. This amendment, necessary for CCUS-EOR regulations, could also be used for CCUS
activities that are not related to the hydrocarbons sector. However, arguments can be made in favor
of the interpretation that would entitle ASEA to regulate permanent storage under CCUS-EOR
activities; in particular the impossibility to properly remove the CO2 used for EOR after the field
has been depleted rendering permanent storage the only viable option and hence a part of the

                                                                                                  224
CCUS-EOR activities.

The manner in which liability (in particular long-term liability) has been treated in most of the
reviewed legislative frameworks is similar. In most cases, subject to certain conditions, the liability
is transferred to the appointed state authority after a certain period of time. However, in the current
Mexican regulatory framework environmental liability has a statute of limitations of 12 years as of
the environmental damage or its effects, which would render the statute of limitations “without
limitation” and there is certainly no transfer of liability or in the case of hazardous wastes 20 years
after closure of confinement activities of hazardous wastes. If the pilot projects were to be set in
motion by a government authority other than PEMEX or CFE this recommendation would not be
relevant as it would be the government that is and remains liable. However, with the new regime
under which PEMEX and CFE operate a permanent liability, a heavy burden would be placed on
those operators. Similarly, in other jurisdictions reviewed as part of this study, a transfer of
responsibility for the consequences of permanent storage operations has been established following
compliance with strict conditions by the operator, who must demonstrate that all necessary
measures have been taken with a view to ensure the storage site is permanently sealed and no
leakages have occurred. As such, we recommend an amendment to the LGEEPA (in what would be
the CCUS chapter) that modifies the liability period stated in the Federal Environmental
Responsibility Law, exclusively for CCUS activities, and states the time period and conditions
under which the liability transfer is made to SEMARNAT.

Box 7. Recommendations for the regulatory framework for CCUS in Mexico in relation to storage in
the hydrocarbons sector

CO2 storage in the hydrocarbons sector
    1. It is recommended that guidelines be adopted by ASEA regulating several aspects of CCUS
        activities in relation to the hydrocarbons sector, including the authorization for the injection of CO 2
        in the underground and for temporary storage aspects.
    2. In relation to long-term storage and associated liability, there is a gap in the existing Mexican
        regulatory framework as the long-term use of the underground would need to be authorized.
    3. Three potential routes for ensuring an adequate regulatory framework for long-term storage
        activities have been identified through the course of this project:
             i. CO2 could be treated as a hazardous waste since a mixture of hazardous waste (irrespective
                   of the amount of hazardous waste included in the mixture) with any other material or
                   substance would render the substance a hazardous waste and consequently subject to the
                   regulation on hazardous waste. This would require no legislative changes for enabling the
                   injection of CO2 in the underground. In this case, strict conditions on the concentrations of
                   hazardous waste in the mixture would have to be established by means of implementing
                   regulations (similar to the requirements in other jurisdictions on the composition of the
                   CO2 stream).
             ii. Alternatively, we would suggest that SEMARNAT be granted with the entitlement to
                   permit the long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO 2 storage. As
                   environmental matters have as a general framework the LGEEPA (with numerous
                   exceptions), which has provisions for the three levels of government, we would suggest the
                   amendment of the LGEEPA to include a new chapter on CCUS activities, including long-
                   term storage and corresponding regulations.
             iii. A broader interpretation of ASEA entitlements in view of the reality of the CCUS-EOR
                   activities, granting ASEA the possibility of regulating long-term-storage of CCUS-EOR
                   activities.
    4. Related to this issue, we would recommend amending the LGEEPA in relation to the liability period
        for environmental damage established in the Federal Environmental Responsibility Law,
        exclusively for CCUS activities, defining the time period and conditions under which a transfer of
        liability is made to SEMARNAT.


                                                                                                             225
6.5    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN
       RELATION TO USE AND STORAGE OUTSIDE OF THE HYDROCARBONS SECTOR


Regarding longer-term demonstration and commercial-scale projects that are not related to the
hydrocarbons sector and hence not subject to ASEA CCUS Regulations (when issued) and, in case
certain preliminary recommendations that were made for the purposes of the workshop, in particular
regarding the treatment of the CCUS stream as a hazardous waste, are not considered, then we
would recommend the following:

As mentioned above the LGEEPA operates as the general framework on environmental matters,
with a few exceptions that include the General Law on Climate Change, as such our view is that an
amendment to such law would prove adequate for the regulation of CCUS activities. We would
recommend the inclusion of an additional chapter to regulate permanent storage aspects, including
temporary and permanent storage, liability aspects and other issues not covered by existing
legislation. Furthermore, an amendment to the First Title, Chapter IV, Section V and the
corresponding section of the Regulations would be required to include CCUS activities subject to
environmental impact evaluation (in particular permanent storage).

Box 8. Recommendations for the regulatory framework for CCUS in Mexico in relation to storage
outside of the hydrocarbons sector

CO2 storage outside of the hydrocarbons sector
    1. Two potential routes for ensuring an adequate regulatory framework for storage activities outside of
        the hydrocarbons sector have been identified through the course of this project:
             i. CO2 could be treated as a hazardous waste, since a mixture of hazardous waste
                  (irrespective of the amount of hazardous waste included in the mixture) with any other
                  material or substance would render the substance a hazardous waste and consequently
                  subject to the regulation on hazardous waste. This would require no legislative changes for
                  enabling the injection of CO2 in the underground. In this case, strict conditions on the
                  concentrations of hazardous waste in the mixture would have to be established by means of
                  implementing regulations (similar to the requirements in other jurisdictions on the
                  composition of the CO2 stream).
             ii. Alternatively, we would suggest that SEMARNAT be granted with the entitlement to
                  permit the long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO 2 storage. As
                  environmental matters have as a general framework the LGEEPA (with numerous
                  exceptions), which has provisions for the three levels of government, we would suggest the
                  amendment of the LGEEPA to include a new chapter on CCUS activities, including long-
                  term storage and the corresponding regulations.
    2. Related to this issue and similarly to the case for long-term storage in the hydrocarbons sector, we
        would recommend amending the LGEEPA in relation to the liability period for environmental
        damage established in the Federal Environmental Responsibility Law, exclusively for CCUS
        activities, defining the time period and conditions under which a transfer of liability is made to
        SEMARNAT.




                                                                                                          226
7    CONCLUSIONS


Based on the above, several recommendations have been formulated with a view to ensure an
adequate regulatory framework for CCUS activities in Mexico, based on a thorough comparison
with international regulatory practices and models.

At this point in time, there is no explicit regulatory framework for CCUS activities in Mexico. The
recent Energy Reform has introduced a legal basis for adopting implementing regulations on CCUS
activities in the hydrocarbons sector, which could regulate many aspects associated with CCUS
activities in the currently envisaged pilot projects in Mexico. Nevertheless, the assessment has
shown that a number of important aspects are currently missing in the Mexican legal framework.

In particular in relation to storage, the authorization of long-term storage and associated liability for
environmental damage would require additional regulation.

CO2 capture and transport

In relation to the capture side, most aspects seem adequately covered, though improvements to the
regulatory framework should be considered, in particular in relation to monitoring and reporting.
Moreover, the Energy Reform has modified the regulatory competencies for activities in the
hydrocarbons sector. In relation to capture this means that capture activities in industrial plants in
the hydrocarbons sector, such as refineries or petrochemical installations, would have to be
regulated by means of new regulations by ASEA.

In relation to CO2 transport, legislative changes may be needed to enable the transport of CO2,
either through the expansion of existing legal requirements or the development of a new legal basis.
Moreover, operational conditions shall be regulated by means of regulatory instruments.

In relation to CO2 storage activities as part of CCUS activities, we recommend the following:

CO2 Storage Activities in the Hydrocarbon Sector

The current regulatory framework would have provisions that enable storing CO 2 if it is considered
a hazardous waste. We would recommend considering such option, in particular for the pilot
projects that need to be implemented in a short-time period. Moreover, these provisions regulate
long-term storage and would thus be able to be used to authorize the long-term storage of CO2 in a
relatively short timeframe. It should be noted that, in this case, implementing regulations would
require being adopted regulating the composition of the CO2 stream or the composition of the
hazardous waste mixture that is allowed to be considered a CCUS operation.

However, if a decision is made not to consider CO2 as a hazardous waste only for storage purposes,
an alternative option in the existing regulatory framework would consist of ASEA including in the
ASEA Regulations on CCUS-EOR matters all matters related to storage of CO2 in EOR activities or
any other activity in the hydrocarbon sector that will involve storage of CO2 as part of such activity,
including permanent storage if such activity can be considered as part of a mainstream process that
involves hydrocarbons.

Notwithstanding the above, if permanent storage can be considered as part of a hydrocarbon
activity, one issue related to the use of the land will still need to be resolved. Permanent storage
activities would require MRV for a long-term period beyond sealing the storage site, which would

                                                                                                     228
need the approval from the title owner of such land. For such matters, in order to avoid any conflicts
with the title owner, in case of permanent storage, we would recommend amending the existing
Hydrocarbons Law or including specifications in the ASEA Regulations, in order to clearly define
that for permanent storage activities, a permanent right of way or expropriation of the land will be
needed.

CO2 Storage Activities outside of the Hydrocarbon Sector

Regarding longer-term demonstration and commercial-scale projects that are not located in or
related to the hydrocarbons sector and hence not subject to ASEA CCUS Regulations (when
issued), we would recommend considering the option of storing CO2 as hazardous waste. Existing
legal provisions that regulate such activities would not require amending or the adoption of new
legislation, which may be a time-consuming and difficult process. Strict implementing regulations
on the composition of the hazardous waste mixture and allowed concentrations of such waste would
have to be established by means of implementing regulations, similarly to what is done in other
jurisdictions on the composition of the CO2 stream, whereby maximum concentrations of impurities
are legally established.

In case the storage of CO2 as a hazardous waste is not considered, a viable option we recommend
would be amending LGEEPA, which operates as the general framework on environmental matters
and would prove adequate to the purposes of regulating CCUS activities. More precisely, inclusion
of an additional chapter regulating permanent storage aspects, including temporary and permanent
storage, liability aspects and other issues not covered by existing legislation, would be required.
Furthermore, an amendment to the First Title, Chapter IV, Section V and the corresponding section
of the Regulations would be required to include CCUS activities subject to environmental impact
evaluation (in particular permanent storage).

Likewise, the long-term use of the subsurface of the land where the CO2 is being permanently
stored needs to be regulated. As the issue is essentially one of environmental protection or
greenhouse gasses reduction, we would suggest that SEMARNAT be granted with the entitlement
to permit the long-term use of the Mexican subsurface for permanent CO2 storage, through an
amendment of the LGEEPA, including a new chapter on CCUS activities, long-term storage and
corresponding regulations.

Such amendment could also be used for CCUS-EOR activities in case ASEA does not consider the
permanent storage of CO2 as an activity that can be a part of hydrocarbon activities.

Long-Term Liability for CCUS activities

Regarding liability, specifically long-term liability, we would recommend an amendment to the
LGEEPA (in what would be the CCUS chapter) that modifies the liability period stated in the
Federal Environmental Responsibility Law, exclusively for CCUS activities, and states the time
period and conditions under which the liability transfer is made to SEMARNAT.

Environmental Protection and Climate Change Mitigation

Moreover, the report recommends that additional regulatory changes be made in Mexico from an
overarching or supporting nature for the deployment of CCUS activities. An extension of the
LGEEPA that aims to apply the requirements for environmental impact assessments would enhance
environmental protection and prior detection of potential environmental risks associated with a
specific project as well as ensure the engagement of the public in decision-making on the projects.

                                                                                                  229
It is also recommended that the Mexican regulatory framework for climate change mitigation be
enhanced to provide incentives for CCUS activities as part of climate mitigation strategies. While
still insufficient or not operational, several initiatives are currently underway to provide concrete
incentives for the deployment of CCUS activities. The further operationalization of the Mexican
carbon market coupled with emission performance standards or emission limitations could provide
such incentives.

ANNEX I. DETAILED REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES AND MODEL POLICIES FOR REGULATING CCUS


A I.1 Detailed assessment of best regulatory practices in the European Union, Canada, United States and Australia

Table 5. European Union
                                                  EU (CCS Directive, IED and any other relevant legislation)
                                                                              General
  1.   Classification of   CO2 is classified in the EU as a pollutant when emitted. Therefore, legislation concerning ambient air protection and limitation of
       CO2 and its legal   emissions as well general environmental legislation (concerning e.g. environmental impact assessment and liability for environmental
       implications        damage) is applicable to CCS activities in the EU.

                           CO2 captured and transported for the purposes of geological storage has been explicitly excluded from the scope of application of
                           waste legislation (by virtue of an amendment to Directive 2006/60/EC on waste and Regulation 1013/2006 on shipments of waste).

                           Finally, the CCS Directive, as a legal instrument specifically designed to regulate the storage of CO 2, refers specifically to CO2 without
                           proceeding to a classification of the substance in this legislation.
  2.   Property rights     EU level legislation does not regulate property rights. Property rights, concerning both land property as well as property of capture,
                           transport and storage installations, are regulated at the Member State (national) level.
  3.   Competition         In accordance with Article 5(4) of the CCS Directive446, the holder of an exploration permit must have the sole right to explore the
       with other users    potential of a CO2 storage complex and no conflicting uses of the complex are permitted during the period of validity of the exploration
       and preferential    permit.
       rights issues
                           In accordance with Article 6(3) of the CCS Directive, priority for the granting of a storage permit for a site must be given to the holder
                           of the exploration permit for that site, provided that the exploration of that site is completed, that any condition set in the exploration
                           permit has been complied with, and that the application for a storage permit is made during the period of validity of the exploration
                           permit. No conflicting uses of the storage complex are allowed during the storage permit procedure. In accordance with article 6(1),
                           there must be only one operator on the site and no conflicting uses are permitted on the site during the validity of the storage permit.
                           The CCS Directive does not provide for the minimum or maximum validity duration of storage permits. It means that Member States
                           are free to decide on the validity duration of permits.
  4.   Composition of      Article 12(1) of the CCS Directive sets out requirements for the composition of the CO 2 stream. A CO2 stream must consist
       the CO2 stream      overwhelmingly of carbon dioxide. To this end, no waste or other matter may be added for the purpose of disposing of that waste or

85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.


                                                                                                                                                                  232
                           other matter. However, a CO2 stream may contain incidental associated substances from the source, capture or injection process and
                           trace substances added to assist in monitoring and verifying CO 2 migration. Concentrations of all incidental and added substances must
                           be below levels that would: (a) adversely affect the integrity of the storage site or the relevant transport infrastructure; (b) pose a
                           significant risk to the environment or human health; or (c) breach the requirements of applicable Community legislation. The EU
                           requirements for the composition of the CO2 stream are phrased in a rather general manner (e.g. the use of the word ‘overwhelmingly’),
                           leaving a margin for discretion for Member States in determining detailed regulations concerning composition of the stream. Some
                           Member States specified in their legislation how many % of carbon dioxide must the CO2 stream consist of (e.g. in Latvia CO2 stream
                           must comprise at least 96% by volume of CO2, in Slovakia and Hungary – 95%) In addition, some countries (e.g. Belgium) issued
                           secondary legislation on the CO2 stream composition, setting out detailed conditions on the composition of the stream. The European
                           Commission adopted guidelines to help Member states to identify the conditions for respecting the CO 2 stream composition criteria set
                           out in Article 12 of the CCS Directive. 447

                           CO2 streams may only be accepted and injected by operators if an analysis of the composition, including corrosive substances, of the
                           streams and a risk assessment have been carried out, and if the risk assessment has shown that the contamination levels are in line with
                           the conditions in the Directive. Moreover, the operator shall keep a register of the quantities and properties of the CO 2 streams
                           delivered and injected, including the composition of those streams.
  5.   Engaging the        Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (hereinafter EIA
       public in           Directive)448 contains rules for the engagement of the public in decision making when an environmental impact assessment is required.
       decision making
                           According to Article 6(4) of the EIA Directive, in the course of the permitting procedure, the public concerned must be given early
                           and effective opportunities to participate in the decision making procedures when an environmental impact assessment is
                           required for a given project. Article 2(e) of the EIA Directive defines the ‘public concerned’ as follows: ‘public concerned’ means
                           the public affected or likely to be affected by, or having an interest in, the environmental decision-making procedures referred to in
                           Article 2(2). For the purposes of this definition, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and meeting any
                           requirements under national law shall be deemed to have an interest. The general public has the right to be informed (by virtue of
                           public notices or by other appropriate means such as electronic media) about certain issues, such as the request for permit, the
                           competent authorities or the draft decision.

                           For the purpose of public participation, the public concerned must be entitled to express comments and opinions when all options are
                           open to the competent authority before the decision on the request for a permit is taken. It must be informed by the competent authority
                           about the aspects listed above as well as about the relevant environmental documentation provided to the competent authority by the
                           developer, the main reports and advices issued to the competent authority as well as about other relevant information that has become
                           available after the time the public concerned was informed. The results of the public information and participation must be examined

                             and taken into consideration by the permitting authority when issuing a permit.

                             Reasonable time-frames for the different phases of public information and consultation must be provided by Member States, allowing
                             sufficient time for informing the public and for the public concerned to prepare and participate effectively in the decision-making.

                             The public concerned has also the right to challenge a decision on a permit taken by the competent authority. In accordance with
                             Article 9 of the EIA Directive, the public must be informed by the competent authority about the content of the decision (permit) and
                             the main reasons and considerations on which the decision (permit) is based, including information about the public participation
                             process. This information must not prejudice commercial and industrial confidentiality rules, including intellectual property, and the
                             safeguarding of the public interest. The public concerned which has sufficient interest or, alternatively, whose rights have been
                             impaired by the decision449, has the right to access a review procedure before a court or another independent and impartial body
                             established by law of a Member State to challenge the substantive or procedural legality of the decision (permit), act or omission ( so
                             called judicial review).
  6.   Scope of              The CCS Directive establishes a legal framework for geological storage of CO 2. Specific aspects concerning CO2 capture and storage
       framework and         are covered by other pieces of EU legislation, mainly the EIA Directive, Directive 2004/35/CE on environmental liability
       prohibitions          (hereinafter ELD)450 and Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (hereinafter IED)451.

                             The CCS Directive applies to geological storage of CO2 in the territory of the Member States, their exclusive economic zones and on
                             their continental shelves within the meaning of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).

                             The CCS Directive does not apply to geological storage of CO2, with a total intended storage below 100 kilotonnes, undertaken for
                             research, development or testing of new products and processes.

                             The storage of CO2 in the water column is not to be permitted. A water column is defined as "the vertically continuous mass of water
                             from the surface to the bottom sediments of a water body." This is consistent with requirements under the London Protocol
                             and OSPAR Convention that injection of CO2 in offshore areas must be into a sub-soil geological formation.
  7.   Definition of         In the EU, the definition of ‘CCS ready’ does not exist as such. However, Article 33 of the CCS Directive introduces the ‘CCS ready’
       ´CCS ready´           requirement into EU legislation. In accordance with that provision (which is an amendment to the IED), operators of all combustion
                             plants with a rated electrical output of 300 megawatts or more for which the original construction licence or, in the absence of such a
                             procedure, the original operating licence is granted after the entry into force of the CCS Directive, must assess whether the following
                             conditions are met:

449
    What constitutes a sufficient interest and impairment of a right is to be determined by the Member States, consistently with the objective of giving the public concerned wide
access to justice. In this context, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and meeting any requirements under national law are deemed to have a
sufficient interest or, alternatively, are deemed to have rights capable of being impaired.

                          — suitable storage sites are available,
                          — transport facilities are technically and economically feasible,
                          — it is technically and economically feasible to retrofit for CO2 capture.

                          If the above conditions are met, the competent authority of a given Member State must ensure that suitable space on the installation site
                          for the equipment necessary to capture and compress CO 2 is set aside. The competent authority must determine whether the conditions
                          are met on the basis of the assessment of the above conditions and other available information, particularly concerning the protection of
                          the environment and human health.
  8.   Incentives for     Emissions of CO2 captured, transported and stored in accordance with the CCS Directive are covered by the emissions trading scheme
       CCS as part of     introduced by the Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the
       climate            Community (ETS Directive)452. This means that an obligation to surrender emission allowances does not arise in respect of emissions
       mitigation         of CO2 verified as captured and transported for permanent storage. For details, see section on ‘Coverage by GHG trading schemes’.

  9.   Authorization      The authorisation process for CO2 capture is mainly regulated by the provisions of the IED and the EIA Directive.
       for capture
                          IED applies to installations and activities listed in Annex I to that Directive. Annex I of the IED covers, inter alia, the types of activities
                          and installations that are the source of CO2 emissions, such as (i) energy industry – e.g. combustion of fuels in installations with a total
                          rated thermal input of 50 MW or more, refining of mineral oil and gas, production of coke; (ii) production and processing of metals;
                          (iii) mineral industry, (iv) chemical industry; (vi) waste management and other activities, including also activities related to capture
                          of CO2 streams from installations covered by the IED Directive (point 6.9 of Annex I to the IED).

                          The IED provides that Member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that no installation or combustion plant, waste
                          incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant is operated without a permit and the permit procedure meets the requirements set out
                          in the IED. Chapter II of the IED sets out conditions, including permitting conditions, for activities specified in Annex I, thus including
                          CO2 capture installations. However, before a permit for a CO 2 capture installation is applied for and granted in accordance with the
                          IED, a developer might be required to carry out an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the EIA Directive. (see below)
                          Before the permit for a CO2 capture installation is granted, the permitting authority must take into account the results of the public
                          consultation and environmental impact assessment. Article 12 of the IED Directive provides what kind of documentation and
                          information must be provided along with an application for a permit (including for CO2 capture). This information includes, inter alia,
                          a description of the installation; the sources of emissions from the installation; the conditions of the installation site; where applicable,
                          a baseline report which contains the information necessary to determine the state of soil and groundwater contamination; identification
                          of significant effects of the emissions on the environment and proposed technology for reducing the emissions; measures planned to
                          monitor emissions into the environment and the main alternatives to the proposed technology.

                    Permit conditions for CO2 capture must be established by the competent authority, after prior consultations with the operator, on the
                    basis of the best available techniques that it has determined for the capture of CO2, by giving special consideration to the criteria for
                    determining the best available techniques listed in Annex III to the IED.

                    In addition, Article 14 of the IED provides that the permit must include all necessary measures to ensure that: (i) all the appropriate
                    preventive measures are taken against pollution and that no significant pollution is caused; (ii) the best available techniques are applied
                    (where an environmental quality standard requires stricter conditions than those achievable by the use of the best available techniques,
                    additional measures must be included in the permit); (iii) the necessary measures are taken to prevent accidents and limit their
                    consequences; (iv) the necessary measures are taken upon definitive cessation of activities to avoid any risk of pollution and return the
                    site of operation to the satisfactory state, having regard to the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination at the site of the
                    installation.

                    The above measures must include, inter alia, emissions limit values, suitable emission monitoring requirements, and obligation to
                    inform the competent authority about the results of the monitoring, appropriate requirements for the regular maintenance of measures
                    taken to prevent emissions to soil and groundwater, measures relating to conditions other than normal operating conditions such as
                    start-up and shut-down operations, leaks, malfunctions, momentary stoppages and definitive cessation of operations.

                    The above measures are specified in detail in relevant EU directives.

                    It should be noted that Member States are free to establish and shape their (administrative) permitting procedures, including the
                    determination of competent authorities and division of their competences. Therefore, details concerning the authorization procedure
                    will depend on the national legislation of respective Member States. Nevertheless, the procedures must always comply with the general
                    rules established by the EU law.
10. Monitoring,     A permit for an installation (including CO2 capture installations) must include emission monitoring requirements which should specify
    reporting and   measurement methodology, frequency and evaluation procedure. Results of this monitoring must be submitted to the competent
    verification    authority regularly, at least annually. The permit should also include requirements for the regular maintenance and surveillance of
    (MMV)           measures taken to prevent emissions to soil and groundwater. Finally, the specific monitoring requirements for GHG installations in
    requirements    the EU will apply.
11. Inspection      Article 22 of the IED obliges Member States to set up a system of environmental inspections of IED installations (including CO2
                    capture installations) to ensure examination of the full range of environmental effects from the installation concerned. Operators must
                    afford the competent authorities all necessary assistance to enable those authorities to carry out any site visits, to take samples and to
                    gather any information necessary. Inspections must be routine (based on programmes for routine environmental inspections prepared
                    by the competent authority) and non-routine to investigate serious environmental complaints, serious environmental accidents,
                    incidents and occurrences of non-compliance as soon as possible.

                    The period between two site visits must be based on a systematic appraisal of the environmental risks of the installation concerned and



                                                                                                                                                           236
                         must not exceed 1 year for installations posing the highest risks and 3 years for installations posing the lowest risks. Following each
                         site visit, the competent authority must prepare a report which is notified to the operator and made publicly available.
                                                                         CO2 transport
12. Authorization of     Authorization of transportation infrastructure is not regulated under the CCS Directive. Provisions of the EIA Directive are applicable
    transportation       to the permitting process for CO2 pipelines.
    infrastructure
    (pipeline            In accordance with the EIA Directive, pipelines with a diameter of more than 800 and length of more than 40 km for transportation of
    regulations, etc.)   CO2, including associated booster stations must undergo an environmental impact assessment before a permit for these activities is
                         granted by the competent authority (obligatory environmental impact assessment). Other pipelines for the transport of CO2 streams (
                         with a diameter of less than 800 and length of less than 40 km) are subject to a screening procedure (see below).

                         The authorities likely to be concerned by the project by reason of their specific environmental responsibilities are given an opportunity
                         to express their opinion on the information supplied by the developer.

                         Before the final decision on a permit for a transportation network is granted, the permitting authority must take into account the results
                         of the public consultation and the environmental impact assessment.

                         Besides the EIA Directive, EU legislation does not prescribe specific rules for the CO 2 transportation infrastructure authorisation
                         process. The details are to be established at the Member State (national) level. In some Member States, gas pipeline permits are
                         required for the transport of CO2. In other Member States, there are specific CO2 permits or permits for the transport of other
                         substances than oil and gas. Details concerning the authorization procedure will depend on the national legislation of respective
                         Member States.
13. Third-party          Third-party access to transportation infrastructure is regulated by the CCS Directive. In accordance with Article 21 of that Directive,
    access to            Member States must establish measures to ensure that potential users are able to obtain access to transport networks and storage sites,
    transportation       in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. It must be noted that such phrasing is relatively general and provides Member States
    infrastructure       with a margin of discretion in shaping the third-party access requirements.

                         The following aspects must be taken into account when providing access to transportation networks and storage sites: (i) the storage
                         area which is or can reasonably be made available, (ii) the proportion of CO 2 reduction obligations that the Member State concerned
                         intends to meet through CO2 capture and storage, (iii) the need to refuse access when there is an incompatibility of technical
                         specifications which cannot be reasonably overcome and (iv) the need to respect the duly substantiated reasonable needs of the owner
                         or operator of the storage site or of the transport network and the interests of all other users of the storage or the network or relevant
                         processing or handling facilities who may be affected.

                         Access may be refused on the grounds of lack of capacity. Duly substantiated reasons must be given for such refusal. An operator may
                         refuse access on the grounds of lack of capacity or lack of connection after having made necessary enhancements, as far as it is
                         economic to do so or when a potential customer is willing to pay for them, provided that this would not negatively impact on the



                                                                                                                                                               237
                        environmental security of a transport network and storage site.
14. Transboundary       The CCS Directive contains very general and scarce regulations on transboundary movement of CO 2. Article 24 of the Directive
    movement of         merely provides that in cases of transboundary movement of CO 2, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned must
    CO2                 jointly meet the requirements of the CCS Directive and other relevant EU legislation.

                        In addition, Article 22(2) provides for dispute settlement in the event of cross-border disputes. In this case, the dispute settlement
                        arrangements of the Member State having jurisdiction over the transport network to which access has been refused are applicable.
                        Where, in cross-border disputes, more than one Member State covers the transport network, the Member States concerned must consult
                        with a view to ensuring that this Directive is applied consistently.
                                                                      CO2 storage and usage

17. Authorization of    According to the CCS Directive, exploration may be carried out to assess storage capacity in parts or in the whole territory of a
    storage site        Member State concerned. In accordance with Article 5 of the CCS Directive, no exploration can be carried out without an exploration
    exploration         permit. Procedures for the granting of exploration permits must be open to all entities possessing the necessary capacities and such
    activities          permits must be granted and refused on the basis of objective, published and non-discriminatory criteria. Details of such procedures are
                        to be decided at a national (Member State) level. Member States may designate authorities competent to issue exploration permits and
                        specific requirements for their issuance, as long as they are in compliance with the general conditions specified in Article 5 of the CCS
                        Directive.

                        An environmental impact assessment is not required for exploration activities.

                        The duration of a permit must not exceed the period necessary to carry out the exploration for which it is granted. However, the
                        validity of the permit may be extended where the stipulated duration is insufficient to complete the exploration concerned and where
                        the exploration has been performed in accordance with the permit. Exploration permits are granted in respect of a limited volume
                        area.
18. Regulating site     In accordance with Article 4 of the CCS Directive, Member States have the right to determine the areas in which storage sites may be
    selection and       selected. This right includes the right to prohibit any storage in parts and in the whole territory of a Member State concerned. In
    characterisation    practice, several Member States made use of the option to prohibit CO 2 storage in their whole territory. Other countries allowed for
    activities          storage only in parts of their territory (e.g. in Poland, storage is allowed only in the Cambrian basin in the exclusive economic zone of
                        the Republic of Poland) or in the whole territory.



                                                                                                                                                              238
                               Those Member States which intend to allow for CO2 storage on their territory must carry out an assessment of storage capacity
                               available in their territory, including by allowing exploration. The European Commission has the right to organize exchange of
                               information and best practices between those countries. While some Member States require exploration only in cases where there is
                               too little information to apply directly for a storage permit, others always require exploration permits. 453

                               The suitability of a geological formation for use as a storage site must be determined through a characterisation and assessment of
                               the potential storage complex and surrounding area pursuant to the criteria specified in Annex I to the Directive. In accordance with
                               Annex I, the characterisation and assessment must be carried out in three steps (step 1: data collection, step 2: building three-
                               dimensional static geological earth model and step 3: characterization of the storage dynamic behavior, sensitivity characterization and
                               risk assessment) and according to best practices at the time of the assessment. The detailed criteria for each of these steps are contained
                               in the Annex. Potential operators have to take account of people living in the surrounding areas and the local species and habitats and
                               prepare analysis of potential environmental and health impacts.
                               A geological formation may only be selected as a storage site, if under the proposed conditions of use there is no significant risk of
                               leakage, and if no significant environmental or health risks exist.
  19. Authorization of         The storage permit is the key tool in ensuring that CCS takes place in an environmentally safe way. No storage is allowed without a
      storage activities       permit. In accordance with the CCS Directive, procedures for the granting of storage permits must be open to all entities possessing the
                               necessary capacities and all permits must be granted on the basis of objective, published and transparent criteria. The permitting
                               procedure is organized by each of the Member States, but has to comply with the conditions set out in the EU CCS Directive.

                               In the application for a storage permit, potential operators need to provide the competent authority with, inter alia, proof of their
                               technical competence to operate a storage safely, description of the storage site and the storage complex to ensure that a geological
                               formation will be selected only if there is no risk for CO 2 leakage and other health and environmental damage. The developer also must
                               provide information about the total quantity of CO 2 to be injected in the chosen geological formation as well as the prospective sources
                               of CO2, transport methods, allowed composition of CO 2 stream, injection rates and pressures and location of injection facilities. In
                               order to ensure safe functioning of the future storage site, the potential operator must also describe what measures he/she will take to
                               prevent significant irregularities, must propose a monitoring plan, corrective measures, provisional post-closure plan and provide a
                               proof of financial security that must be valid and effective prior to the injection. Before an application for a storage permit may be
                               submitted to the competent authority, the potential operator must carry out an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the
                               EIA Directive.

                               The competent authority issues a storage permit only if all requirements of the CCS Directive as well as of other relevant EU
                               legislation are met. In this context, any injection of CO2 into saline aquifers for the purposes of geological storage is subject to the EU

                            legislation on the protection of groundwater454 . In addition, provisions of other directives must be taken into account during the
                            application process, e.g. the ELD (liability for damage to local environment, protected species, natural habitats, water and land), the
                            ETS Directive and the occupational health and safety legislation 455. The storage permit might be issued only if the potential operator
                            has the financial and technical capacity to operate and control the site, including the necessary training of the staff. The storage permits
                            must contain, inter alia, precise information about the storage site and CO 2 stream, approved monitoring plan, reporting obligations,
                            corrective measures, closure and post-closure conditions and financial security requirements.

                            In order to ensure consistency of implementation of the CCS Directive across the EU and to boost public confidence in CO 2 storage
                            safety, all storage permit applications as well as draft permits must be made available to the Commission for review. The Commission
                            must issue an opinion and Member States must provide reasons for not following this.
  20. International         Legal barriers to the geological storage of CO2 under the seabed have been removed by the adoption of related risk management
      laws for the          frameworks under the 1996 London Protocol on the Prevention and Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matter. In 2006, the
      protection of the     Contracting Parties to the London Protocol adopted amendments to the Protocol which allow and regulate CO2 storage in geological
      marine                formations under the seabed. To date, among EU countries, only the UK and the Netherlands have ratified the amendment. 456

                            Also the Contracting Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)
                            adopted amendments to the Annexes to the Convention in order to allow CO 2 storage under the seabed. They also adopted a Decision
                            to ensure environmentally safe CO2 storage and Guidelines for Risk Assessment and Management of CO2 storage. In addition, a
                            Decision to prohibit storage of CO2 into the water-column of the sea and on the seabed has been issued.457
  21. Project               In accordance with Article 15 of the CCS Directive, each Member State is required to carry out routine and non-routine inspections
      inspections           of the storage complex. Routine inspections must be carried out at least once a year until three years after closure and every five years
                            until transfer of responsibility to the competent authority has occurred. Non-routine inspections must be carried out in specific when a
                            competent authority receives complains about damage to the environment and human health or reports about leverages.

                            Inspections should include activities such as visits of the surface installations, including the injection facilities, assessing the injection
                            and monitoring operations carried out by the operator, and checking all relevant records kept by the operator. Details concerning the
                            inspections are to be decided upon at the national (Member State) level.
  22. Monitoring,           In accordance with Article 13 of the CCS Directive, monitoring of the injection facilities, the storage complex (including, where
      reporting and         possible, the CO2 plume) and, where appropriate, surrounding environment must be carried out by the operator on a basis of a
      verification          monitoring plan that must be approved by the permitting authority in the authorisation procedure. The monitoring plan should be
      (MRV)                 stablished in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex II to the CCS Directive and should cover the main stages of the project, i.e.

                   On the basis of the monitoring plan, the operator is obliged to carry out comprehensive monitoring of specific parameters, such as
                   pressure, temperature and seismic activity as well as the technology employed. Frequency of monitoring must be also set out in the
                   monitoring plan.

                   Article 13 of the CCS Directive indicates the purposes of monitoring, including detecting significant irregularities, migration of CO2,
                   leakages of CO2 and other adverse effects of the storage site on the surrounding environment as well as assessing the effectiveness of
                   corrective measures taken.

                   The operator must report to the competent authority, at a frequency decided by this authority, however in any event at least once a
                   year:
                   (i) results of the monitoring and the monitoring technology employed,

                   In addition, in the event of leakages or significant irregularities, the operator must immediately notify the competent authority. In
                   cases of leakages and significant irregularities which imply the risk of leakage, the operator must also notify the competent authority
                   pursuant to the ETS Directive.
23. Corrective     In accordance with the definition of corrective measures (Art. 3(19) of the CCS Directive), corrective measures are ‘any measures
    measures and   taken to correct significant irregularities or to close leakages in order to prevent or stop the release of CO 2 from the storage complex’.
    remediation
    measures       In the application for the storage permit, the potential operator must include a corrective measures plan that must approved by the
                   permitting authority.

                   If a CO2 leakage or any other significant irregularity occurs, the operator must immediately inform the competent authority and take
                   corrective measures, as minimum on the basis of the corrective measures plan. The competencies of the competent authority in the
                   event of a CO2 leakage are wide. The competent authority may, at any time, require the operator to take necessary corrective measure
                   or measures related to the protection of human health and they can be additional to those laid down in the corrective measures plan.
                   The competent authority may also at any time take corrective measure itself, including when the operator fails to take them itself. It
                   may also recover the cost of action from the operator, including by drawing on the financial security.

                   In addition, remedial actions are also specified in the ELD, which regulates the mitigation of consequences of environmental damage
                   caused by CO2 storage. Overall, the ELD, contains similar requirements to those related to corrective measures in the CCS Directive.
                   In addition, the ELD also requires operators to inform the competent authority and take preventive measures in the event when the
                   environmental damage has not yet occurred but there is an imminent threat of such damage occurring.


                                                                                                                                                          241
  24. Liability during          Liability for environmental damage, i.e. damage to natural habitats, protected species, water and land, caused by CO 2 storage is
      the project               covered under the ELD. This Directive provides for preventive and remedial measures to be taken by the operator as well as regulates
      period                    the financial liability. In principle, the operator must bear the costs for the preventive and remedial actions taken. However, the
                                operator cannot be required to bear these costs if he can prove that the environmental damage or imminent threat of such damage was
                                either (i) caused by a third party and occurred despite the fact that appropriate safety measures were in place; or (ii) resulted from
                                compliance with a compulsory order or instruction from a public authority. In such cases, Member States must take the appropriate
                                measures to enable the operator to recover the costs incurred. Moreover, Member States may allow the operator not to bear the cost of
                                remedial actions where he demonstrates that he was not at fault or negligent and that the environmental damage was caused by an
                                emission or event fully in accordance with the conditions of an authorisation or according to the state of scientific and technical
                                knowledge at the time when the emission was released, the activity was not considered likely to cause environmental damage. Finally,
                                the competent authority can recover from financial guarantees from the operator who has caused the damage or the imminent threat of
                                damage, the costs it has incurred in relation to the preventive or remedial actions taken.

                                Liability for CO2 leaks into the atmosphere are regulated under the ETS Directive. In case of any such leaks, the operator of a CO 2
                                storage site must surrender carbon emission allowances under the ETS Directive.
  25. Liability during          When a storage site has been closed, the operator remains responsible for the site for minimum 20 years458 after the site has been
      the post-closure          closed. The liability conditions are the same as during the operation period of the storage site (see section above).
      period
                                In case a storage site has been closed after withdrawal of a storage permit, the competent authority immediately becomes responsible
                                and liable for the storage site (each Member States must designate a competent authority which is responsible for management of a
                                storage site after the transfer of responsibility). In this case, the liability of the competent authority is the same as the liability of the
                                operator during the operation period of the storage site. The competent authority can recover from the operator, including by drawing
                                on the financial security, the costs incurred in relation to remedial and preventive actions taken after the closure of the site.

                                After the 20 years period passes, liability for the CO 2 storage site is transferred to the competent authority . The liability of the
                                competent authority is the same as the liability of the operator during the operation period of the storage site. The competent authority
                                can recover from the financial contribution provided by the operator (for details, see section below) the costs incurred in relation to
                                remedial and preventive actions taken after the closure of the site.
  26. Financial                 In accordance with Article 20 of the CCS Directive, the operator is required to make a financial contribution available to the
      contributions to          competent authority before the transfer of responsibility for a storage site after the closure of the site takes place. This contribution
      post-closure              must take into account the characteristics of the storage complex, elements relating to the history of storing CO 2 and must cover at least
      stewardship               the anticipated cost of monitoring of the site for a period of 30 years. This contribution can be also used to cover the costs incurred by
                                the competent authority after transfer of the responsibility of the site.



458
      This period can be shortened if the competent authority is convinced that the stored CO2 will be completely and permanently contained before the 20 year period elapses.

      hydrocarbon              storage of CO2, the provisions of the CCS Directive would be applicable. In this case, the provisions of the CCS Directive concerning
      recovery with            leakage would not apply to quantities of CO2 released from surface installations which do not exceed what is necessary in the normal
      CCS                      process of extraction of hydrocarbons, and which do not compromise the security of the geological storage or adversely affect the
                               surrounding environment. Such releases would be covered by the inclusion of storage sites in the ETS Directive, which requires
                               surrender of emissions trading allowances for any leaked emissions.

  30. Planning                 There are no specific planning requirements designed particularly for CCS projects, therefore the general legislation – the SEA
      requirements             Directive – is applicable in these cases. An environmental assessment should be carried out for plans or programmes (e.g. on land use,
      (eg. Strategic           national strategic plans, spacial programmes) which are likely to have significant environmental effects. All CCS activities (including
      environmental            capture, transport and storage) require a strategic environmental assessment.
      assessment)
                               The above mentioned environmental assessment must be carried out during the preparation of a plan or programme and before its
                               adoption or submission to the legislative procedure. In the assessment, the likely significant effects on the environment and the
                               reasonable alternatives of the proposed plan or programme must be identified, taking into account the objectives and the geographical
                               scope of the plan or programme. The detailed requirements concerning the content of the environmental assessment are described in
                               Annex I to the SEA Directive. The public as well as the environmental authorities must be informed and consulted on the draft plan or
                               programme and the environmental report prepared. This also applies to neighbouring countries where the plans are likely to have
                               significant effects in their territory. Once the plan or programme is adopted, the public and environmental authorities must be informed
                               and significant environmental effects of the plan or programme must be monitored in order to identify unforeseen adverse effects and
                               to undertake appropriate remedial action. The details concerning the procedures are to be established by Member States.
  31. Environmental            Environmental impact assessment requirements and the procedure are specified in the EIA Directive. In accordance with that
      Impact                   Directive, before a consent (permit) for a project is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter

                               For the following CCS projects, the EIA is mandatory before a permit is granted:
                                     pipelines with a diameter of more than 800 and length of more than 40 km for transportation of CO 2, including associated

                                         Directive (i.e. installations for which environmental impact assessment is always obligatory)
                                     where the total yearly capture of CO2 is 1.5 megatons or more
                                     CO2 storage sites
                               Other pipelines for the transport of CO2 streams ( with a diameter of less than 800 and length of less than 40 km) as well as other
                               installations for the capture of CO2 streams are subject to a screening procedure – this means that for these installations environmental
                               impact assessment is not obligatory and Member States may decide whether to make them subject to environmental impact assessment
                               or not (for more information about the screening procedure, please see below sections on the authorisation procedure).

                               The environmental impact assessment must identify, describe and assess in an appropriate manner, on case-by-case basis, the direct
                               and indirect effects of a project, taking into account the following factors: (i) human beings, fauna and flora, (ii) soil, water, air, climate
                               and the landscape, (iii) material assets and the cultural heritage, and (iv) interaction between the above factors. For this reason, the
                               developer must provide to the competent authority the necessary documentation. The European Commission has prepared a set of
                               guidance documents to support Member States as well as individual developers in the practical application of the Directive. 460 The
                               Directive also includes requirements to consult with neighbouring Member States and for public consultation.

                               The results of public consultation as well as the information provided by the developer must be taken into consideration by the
                               permitting authority before a permit for a CCS activity is granted.

                               Details of the environmental impact assessment procedure are to be established by each Member State individually.                         The
                               environmental impact assessment may be integrated into the existing procedures for consent to projects in the Member States.
  32. Pollution                One of the main purposes of the CCS Directive is to ensure a high level of protection of the environment from the risks posed by CO2
      prevention               storage. In this context, the EU legislation on the protection of groundwater is particularly relevant. The Water Framework Directive
      requirements             allows for injection of CO2 into saline aquifers for storage purposes and any such injection is subject to the provisions of EU legislation
      (air, water)             on the protection of groundwater, especially Directive 2006/118 on the protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration.
                               Also the Water Framework Directive requires Member States to take measures to prevent and limit input of pollutants into
                               groundwater and prevent deterioration of the status of all bodies of groundwater. With regards to the protection of marine waters, the
                               provisions of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are applicable. They require Member States to take into account pressures and
                               impacts of human activities on marine waters – that would also cover activities related to CO2 transportation pipelines and offshore
                               storage (for details, see section below on ‘ Coastal and marine protection requirements’).

                               With regards to the protection of the ambient air, certain provisions of the CCS Directive are applicable. For instance, in accordance
                               with Article 7 of the CCS Directive, the application for a storage permit must include a description of measures to prevent risks of
                               leakages as well as a proposed corrective measures plan. The IED, which is applicable to capture of CO 2, requires that the application
                               for the activity must include identification of significant effects of the emissions on the environment and proposed technology for

                          reducing the emissions as well as measures planned to monitor emissions into the environment and the main alternatives to the
                          proposed technology. A permit for CO2 capture must include all necessary measures to ensure that all the appropriate preventive
                          measures are taken against pollution and that no significant pollution is caused and that the necessary measures are taken to prevent
                          accidents and limit their consequences.

                          In addition, the EIA requires that the environmental report prepared by the developer must include measures envisaged in order to
                          avoid, reduce and, if possible, remedy significant adverse effects on the environment.
  33. Nature              Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive)461
      legislation         forms the cornerstone of the EU’s nature conservation policy. According to this Directive, each Member State must designate on its
      requirements        territory special areas of conversation which cover natural habitats types listed in Annex I to the Directive and habitats of the species
      (consideration of   listed in Annex II to the Directive. They also include species of wild birds covered by the Birds Directive.
      protected
      habitats and        The Habitats Directive requires Member States to take appropriate measures to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats
      species)            species as well as disturbance of the species hosted on the special areas of conservation. To this end, all plans and projects not directly
                          connected to the management of the protected site but likely to have significant effect on the site (thus including CCS activities) must
                          be subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site. Based on the results of such assessment, the competent national
                          authority can agree to the plan or project only after having verified that it will not negatively affect the integrity of the site concerned
                          and, if appropriate, after having consulted the public. If, in spite of a negative assessment and in the absence of alternative solutions, a
                          plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or
                          economic nature, the Member State must take compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of the site and
                          its surroundings is protected. If the site concerned hosts a priority natural habitat type and/or a priority species, the only considerations
                          which may be raised are those relating to human health or public safety.

                          When CCS projects are subject to a screening procedure under the EIA Directive and a Member State has to determine whether an
                          environmental impact assessment is required for these activities they must also consider whether the project affects areas protected
                          under the Habitats and Birds Directives.

      protection          and maintain good environmental status of marine waters (as determined by the Member States), enable the sustainable use of the sea
      requirements        and inform relevant management decisions. Each Member State must develop and regularly update a marine strategy for its marine

                           programmes must cover activities that may contribute to change of the status of marine waters – this would potentially include also
                           offshore CCS activities. The programme of measures to achieve good environmental status must cover, inter alia, management
                           measures that influence the amount of a human activity that is permitted and the degree of perturbation of an ecosystem component
                           that is permitted as well as management measures that influence where and when an activity is allowed to occur. In addition, those
                           measures must also take into account special areas of conservation of natural habitats and species of habitats under the Habitats
                           Directive (for details, see section entitled ‘Nature legislation requirements’).

                           Directive 2013/30/EU on safety of offshore oil and gas operations 463 , which establishes minimum requirements for preventing major
                           accidents in offshore oil and gas operations and limiting the consequences of such accidents, is not applicable to CCS activities.
  36. Coverage by          The ETS Directive establishes the EU emission trading system and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions.
      GHG trading          The system works on a ‘cap and trade’ basis. In the framework established by the ETS Directive, a ‘cap’ (limit) is set on the total
      schemes              amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by industries (companies) in the system and this amount is gradually reduced in order
                           to ensure that the total amount of emissions lowers over time. Within those limits, industries receive or buy emission allowances and
                           these can be traded between the companies. Each year the companies must surrender enough allowances to cover their emissions,
                           otherwise severe penalties are imposed. Allowances not used in a given year may cover future needs.

                           According to the ETS Directive, an obligation to surrender allowances does not arise in respect of emissions of CO 2 verified as
                           captured and transported for permanent storage to a facility for which a permit is in force. However, in case of any leaks from the
                           storage site, the operator of the site must surrender the relevant amount of carbon emission allowances.
  37. Protecting           The requirements concerning the protection of human health are scattered around the relevant pieces of EU legislation, in particular the
      human health         CCS Directive, the EIA Directive, the IED, as well as the occupational health and safety legislation.

                           The CCS Directive states that CO2 must be stored in such a way as to eliminate negative effects and risks to environment and human
                           health. Operational provisions of the Directive contain more specific requirements concerning human health protection. For example,
                           the composition of the CO2 stream cannot pose a significant risk to the environment and human health and monitoring and inspections
                           of CO2 storage sites must be carried out of the purpose of detecting adverse effects on human health. In case of leakages from a storage
                           site, the operator must take measures necessary to ensure protection of human health.

                           In accordance with the EIA Directive, environmental impact assessment must examine effects of the planned project on, inter alia,
                           human beings. Similarly, under the SEA Directive, an environmental report must analyse the likely significant effects of a planned plan

                               According to Article 8 of the IED (which applies to capture installations), in case a breach of a permit causes an immediate danger to
                               human health, the operation of the installation must be suspended. Inspections of installations must take into account potential and
                               actual impacts of the installation on human health.

                               Liability for environmental damage caused by CO2 storage is covered under the ELD. The definition of environmental damage covers
                               land contamination that creates a significant risk for human health. In case an environmental damage has occurred, an operator of a
                               CO2 storage site must take steps to limit and prevent further adverse effects on human health. Risks to human health must be taken into
                               account when planning remedial measures.
  38. Protecting               The EU has developed a very extensive and stringent occupational health and safety ( OSH) legal and policy framework. 464 No specific
      workers´ safety          OSH legislation related only to CCS activities exists, besides Article 8 of the CCS Directive which merely requires that the storage
                               permit can be issued only when professional and technical development and training of the operator and all staff are provided. Details
                               of this training are to be established by Member States. The general OSH framework is applicable to CCS activities and these OSH
                               regulations must be taken into account by operators when carrying out their activities.

                               Directive 89/391/EEC is a framework law and sets out the main general rules and principles for all sectors of activity, an in particular
                               with regards to responsibilities of employers for the safety and health of workers as well as prevention and elimination of occupational
                               risks. In light of this Directive, employers have the primarily responsibility to ensure the health and safety of workers in every aspect of
                               the work (they can also enlist competent external services for this purpose). They must evaluate the risks to the safety and health of
                               workers in the choice of equipment, the chemical substances and the fitting-out of work places and. On the basis of this evaluation they
                               must establish adequate preventive measures. Employers are also obliged to establish first aid, fire-fighting and evacuation measures
                               and must ensure that each worker receives an adequate health and safety training specific to his workstation. Health surveillance of all
                               workers must be provided at regular intervals. The Directive contains also rules on workers information and consultation and workers
                               obligations.

                            On the basis of Directive 89/391/EEC, a set of OSH directives has been issued which tackle different OSH aspects. With respect to
                            extractive industries, two specific directives were adopted: one on boreholes (onshore and offshore) 465 and the other one on surface and
                            underground extraction and or/prospecting. 466 Since these two directives refer expressly to mineral-extracting it is questionable whether
                            they would be directly applicable to CCS storage. Individual directives have also been issued to ensure adequate protection of
                            pregnant/breastfeeding woman, young people, fixed term and temporary agency workers. A directive on work equipment467 lays down
                            rules on the provision, use and inspection of suitable and adequate equipment. This directive is supplemented by two directives on
                            personal preventive equipment.468 Specific directives on exposure to mechanical vibration, exposure to noise and manual handling of
                            loads469 have been adopted as well as a directive on the protection from risks related to chemical agents at work 470.
  39. Sharing               In accordance with Article 27 of the CCS Directive, every three years Member States must submit to the European Commission a
      knowledge and         report on the implementation of the Directive and the Commission must organise an exchange of information between the competent
      experience            authorities of the Member States. The first report was adopted in February 2014. 471 In addition, an Information Exchange Group has
      through the           been created to arrange an exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States and to promote a coherent
      demonstration         implementation of the CCS Directive across Member States.
      phase                 The ETS Directive has also provided that 300 million emission allowances under the ETS shall be made available to help stimulate the
                            construction and operation of up to eight commercial demonstration projects aimed at the environmentally safe storage of CO 2 in the
                            EU and for the implementation of renewable energy demonstration projects. The so-called NER-300 programme also aims at
                            leveraging complementary investments from the private sector and from national governments. 472
                            Also, A CCS network has been established by the European Commission to accelerate the development of safe, large-scale and
                            commercially viable CCS projects. 473

                            Moreover, in accordance with CCS Directive, Member States must make draft storage permits available to the Commission and the

 1. Classification of   There  is currently no  single, definitive  classification  for CO2 in Alberta and in the rest of Canada. How CO2 is classified depends on
                                                                                             475
      CO2 and its legal what it is used for and  the scope of  the applicable   legislation.     Federal regulation recognized that, although CO2 is not a toxic gas, it
      implications      remains   managed   under  Schedule   1  of  CEPA    1999.   CO 2 was    added to Schedule 1 (List of toxic substances) in order to enable the
                        Government the use of a variety of preventive or control actions as substances that meet the criteria set out in the section 64 of CEPA
                        1999 are substances that are considered harmful if they are released or could be released into the environment in quantities or
                        concentrations or under conditions that they476:
                          a.      have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity;
                          b.      constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends; or
                          c.      constitute or may constitute a danger to human life or health in Canada.

                           In 2013, a Regulatory Working Group carried out an Alberta CCS Regulatory Framework Assessment (RFA) and identified that CO 2
                           classification in Alberta generally occurs within the context of several areas and its classification depends on how it is produced, its
                           concentration, what it is used for and what legislation it falls under. Alberta legislation and regulations addressing CO2 may be
                           classified under the following statutory objectives477:
                                - environmental protection and climate change
                                - natural resource extraction
                                - health and safety
                                - transportation

                           CO2 classification in Alberta generally occurs within the context of each of these areas and is based on the treatment of, and definition
                           for, “gas”. However, under various statutes of current provincial legislation, the ways CO 2 may be classified include, but are not

                           limited to478:
                                - an industrial product or commodity
                                - a controlled product, hazardous substance or hazardous waste, and
                                - a specified gas.

                           The RWG concluded that there is no need to change how CO 2 is currently classified in Alberta. Also, the report clarified how CO 2 is
                           classified in the three main phases of a CCS project479:

                                1. Capture
                           For worker safety, Alberta has classified CO2 as a “harmful substance” by the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation (OHSR);
                           “controlled product” by the Controlled Product Regulations listed in Schedule II to the Hazardous Product Act and “hazardous waste”
                           by the Occupational Health and Safety Code 2000. It is important that, in this context, “hazard” means a situation, condition or object
                           that may be dangerous to the safety or health of workers. A controlled product that is intended for disposal, or is sold for pressure that
                           is intended for disposal would qualify as hazardous waste for the purposes of Occupational Health and Safety. CO 2 would likely
                           qualify as hazardous waste for this purpose. 480

                                2. Transport
                           The transport stage of CCS would generally be similar to the regulatory framework concerned with public safety and environmental
                           control that governs pipelines and shipping. The Pipeline Act has no express classification for CO 2 although it is likely to come under
                           the definition of “gas”.481

                               3. Storage
                           The existing classifications of CO2 in Alberta which fit this stage would be “specified gas.” This is because any leakage would likely
                           amount to emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. If the stored CO2 contained other impurities, it may also be classified as “toxic”. 482
  2.   Property rights     Property rights in Canada have several levels of regulation as Canadian constitutional law has recognized that spheres of jurisdiction
                           can be occupied by different levels of government: provincial and federal jurisdictions. Due to importance to property rights for CCS
                           projects, in 2010, the Mines and Minerals Act and the Oil and Gas Conservation Act were amended to clarify surface and subsurface

                            ownership.

                            Surface property
                            Regarding surface property, there is a distinction between private and public land. Private land requires an agreement between the
                            lessee and the landowner. On public lands, a mineral surface lease must be obtained from Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP) 483.

                            Subsurface property
                            Pore space ownership was made explicit in the Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act 2010, which amended the Mines
                            and Minerals Act. The Mines and Minerals Act vests all pore space in Alberta in the provincial Crown, with the exception of federal
                            Crown land in Alberta484. To reaffirm this declaration, the Mines and Minerals Act states that no agreement, past or future, granting
                            rights to land has conveyed or will convey title to the pore space within the land. It also states that pore space is considered to be an
                            exception contained in the original land grant from the provincial Crown. The Mines and Minerals Act also contains clauses that deem
                            the statutory vesting of pore space not to be an expropriation of land, and as such, prohibits anyone from claiming compensation or
                            damages from the Crown as a result of the vesting 485.Pore space is defined by the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation as the
                            ´pores contained in, occupied by or formerly occupied by minerals or water below the surface of land´486. Also this Regulation
                            stipulates that pore space tenure can only be granted at depths greater than 1000 meters. 487
                            Although in Saskatchewan the pore space associated with Crown minerals is clearly vested in the Crown 488, it is not clear if this right
                            would extend to CO2 disposal projects or if the pore space ownership would be vested in the surface owner or in the Crown.
  3.   Competition          The Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation does not provide the permit holder or the lessee with the exclusive right to evaluate and
       with other users     test (including drilling) or an exclusive right to inject captured CO 2 within the area of the permit or lease (contrast, for example, the
       and preferential     Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Regulation, Alta. Reg. 264/97, s.4). It is possible that the text of the permit and lease will clarify
       rights issues        this matter. Neither does a permit obtain a preferential right to acquire a lease out of the area in which it holds a permit. 489

                            The Oil and Gas Conservation Act requires a project proponent to demonstrate that a CO 2 sequestration project will not interfere with

                            grant rights in respect of a mineral and those rights are included in any disposition issued previously, the agreement is void insofar as it
                            interferes with the previous disposition.
  4.   Composition of       There are no industry-wide standards or limits on the level of impurities in CO2 streams in CCS projects.491 However, the existing
       the CO2 stream       regulatory framework considers impurities only regarding acid gas projects in their design and are evaluated on a case-by case basis.
                            The total percentage of these impurities in a CO2 stream would likely not exceed 10 percent. 492
  5.   Engaging the         One of the first steps an applicant must complete before submitting an application to the regulator is to develop and implement a
       public in            participant involvement program. Currently, there are no public consultation and notification requirements designed specifically for
       decision making      CCS. Therefore, the public participation requirements applied are those of the oil and gas regulatory framework of which the principal
                            objective is to inform local stakeholders and address concerns.493

                            The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) Directives 056, 065, and 071 provide participation requirements that must be considered for an
                            application for an energy-related development project and throughout the life of that development. Directive 056 requires that the
                            project operators confirm that stakeholders do not have objections to the project. In case the confirmation of non-objection is not
                            obtained, the project may proceed to a hearing 494. Directive 065 stablishes a minimum consultation requirement prior to filing
                            applications495. Also Directive 071 determines situations where a consultation is required. 496

                            Furthermore, the applicant must address all questions, objections and concerns regarding the proposed development and attempt to
                            resolve them. This includes concerns and objections raised by members of the public, industry, government representatives, First
                            Nations, and other interested parties. The Government of Alberta also has policy and guidelines related to First Nations Consultation
                            on land management and resource development. Consultation will be required if it is deemed that a project may adversely impact the
                            Rights and Traditional Uses (e.g. by affecting animal populations on nearby lands on which a First Nation exercises a treaty right to
                            hunt those animals for food).497

                            Alberta prohibitions
                            The Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act, 2010 amended a number of pieces of legislation explicitly mandating that
                            CCS projects will not interfere with or negatively impact hydrocarbon projects in the province 499. For example, the Oil and Gas
                            Conservation Act explicitly disposes that the AER may not approve a scheme for the disposal of CCS that will interfere with the
                            recovery or conservation of oil or gas500.

                            The Alberta Water Act provides a framework for protection of non-saline groundwater and the Environmental Protection and
                            Enhancement Act prohibits the release of a substance in an amount that may cause a significant adverse effect. Groundwater
                            monitoring above the base of groundwater protection (BGWP) is important to establish baseline data for freshwater aquifers. It also
                            protects the quality of the drinking water and provides assurance to the public. 501
  7.   Definition of        There is no definition of CCS ready established by the AEP. However, the Guidance on Air Emissions and Monitoring Requirements
       ´CCS ready´          during Combustion of Non-Gaseous Fuels gives an interim definition of CO2 capture ready adapted from the International Energy
                            Agency model (2007) and ICF International (2010) for the Emission Guidelines for the Use of Non-gaseous Fossil Fuels. 502

                                     “A CO2 capture ready facility is a facility which can include CO2 capture when the necessary regulatory or economic
                                     drivers are in place. The aim of building facilities that are capture ready is to reduce the risk of stranded assets or
                                     ‘carbon lock-in’. Developers of capture ready plants should take responsibility for ensuring that all known factors in
                                     their control that would prevent installation and operation of CO 2 capture have been identified and eliminated. This
                                     should include:
                                     1. A study of options for CO2 capture retrofit and potential pre-investments demonstrating that the facility is technically
                                     capable of being retrofitted for CO2 capture using one or more reasonable choices of technology. This study shall
                                     include an evaluation of the economic and other barriers to capture, a timeline for implementation of capture, and
                                     identification of sources for expertise, equipment, materials, and services for plant retrofit and capture operations;
                                     2. Adequate space allowance to be maintained for the future addition of CO2 capture-related equipment, retrofit
                                     construction, and delivery to a CO2 pipeline or other transportation system;
                                     3. Site selection such that transport and storage of captured volumes are technically feasible:

  8.   Incentives for       Under the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER), the use of offset credits is one of four compliance options available to regulate
       CCS as part of       facilities503 to reduce emissions intensity.504
       climate
       mitigation           To qualify a project for offset credits under SGER, the Alberta Government proposed the Quantification Protocol for Capture of CO 2
       strategies           and Permanent Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers (QP) for public comment on November, 2014. This Protocol disposes that the MMV
                            plan will provide evidence of permanent containment of CO 2 in the sequestration complex, and that there is no release of CO 2 to the
                            atmosphere.505

                            In 2012, the Canadian federal government announced strict performance standards for new coal-fired units and units that have reached
                            the end of their useful life. These regulations are expected to result in a reduction of GHG emissions in Canada of about 214
                            megatonnes506.
                                                                              CO2 capture
  9.   Authorization        As federal jurisdiction classifies CO2 as a toxic gas, it should be managed similarly to other airborne emissions. The Alberta region has
       for capture          classified CO2 as a “harmful substance,” “controlled product” and “hazardous waste” (See above 1. Classification of CO 2 and its legal
                            implications). The result of these classifications is that, at the capture stage, CCS could be regulated through the mechanisms put in
                            place by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA), its regulations and code. 507

                            Accidental release would likely be governed by Part 5 of the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) relating to the
                            release of substances, and its regulations508. These classifications appear adequate for the capture stage of a CCS project since capture
                            for various industrial uses, including Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), has been in existence before CCS. There are no specific permits

    The other ways are: meeting its efficiency targets, paying the $15 per tonne levy to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund, and applying emissions performance
credits (EPCs) (generated by a regulated facility that beats its own target).

  10. Monitoring,          Reporting of pollutant emissions in Alberta is regulated in individual operating approvals and by the province's Air Monitoring
      reporting and        Directive. Industry is required to submit monitoring reports to the AEP 510. Reporting requirements are specified in approvals and vary
      verification         depending on the substance, size and nature of the facility. The reports summarize ambient and source monitoring data and provide
      (MMV)                information on the quality assurance and quality control measures performed to ensure accurate data 511.
      requirements
  11. Inspection           The AEP has a Compliance Inspection Program which helps ensure that facilities meet the requirements of their approvals or
                           registrations. The program empowers department inspectors to review and inspect all aspects of any facility's approval or registration,
                           in one visit. The review and inspection can include taking samples of soil, groundwater and effluent and of air emissions at their
                           source. The focus is on identifying and correcting areas of non-compliance. Significant non-compliance can result in enforcement
                           action. Inspections are designed to identify and correct non-compliance. Most inspections are unannounced, to help ensure the
                           program's effectiveness and credibility. 512
                                                                        CO2 transport

      (pipeline            The Pipeline Act requires a pipeline licence holder to develop and implement a pipeline integrity management program, to ensure that
      regulations, etc.)   pipelines are capable of transporting material safely. This Act stablishes the obligation to hold a licence before constructing a pipeline
                           or any part of a pipeline or undertake any operations preparatory or incidental to the construction of a pipeline, unless the regulator
                           considers the public interest.513

                           AER may prescribe a date of construction by which construction of a pipeline is to be commenced or completed 514. Abandonment of a
                           pipeline does not relieve the licensee from the responsibility for further abandonment or other work with respect to the same pipeline or
                           part of a pipeline that may become necessary, or from the responsibility for the costs of the further abandonment or other work515.

                           Also, AER Directive 056 establishes the application licensing process and the requirements to hold a pipeline licence. Moreover, it

  13. Third-party          Currently Alberta does not have any existing regulatory requirements for third party access to CO 2 pipelines. The system used for
      access to            upstream oil and gas pipelines is the common carrier order. However, Sections 48, 49 and 55 of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act do
      transportation       not include CO2 pipelines in the common carrier system517.
      infrastructure
                           The common carrier order is available to parties when private negotiations for pipeline access break down. When this system is
                           employed, a party desiring access to another party’s pipeline can resort to the regulator to request a common carrier order. In general,
                           the applicant must demonstrate:
                           - The need for access (i.e. producible reserves and a reasonable expectation of a market).
                           - That the pipeline operator is acting unreasonably in negotiations.
                           - That the pipeline is:
                                    the only economically feasible way or the most practical way to transport the product or
                                    clearly superior environmentally. 518

                           If the AER designates a pipeline as a common carrier, then the pipeline owner must provide non-discriminatory access to the pipeline.
                           The AER can also direct the proportion of production to be taken by the common carrier from each producer using the pipeline to make
                           capacity available for a new party. If the parties cannot agree on the tariff to be paid for use of the pipeline once a common carrier
                           order is in place, either party can apply to the Alberta Utilities Commission to set the tariff 519.
  14. Transboundary        There are no specific Alberta regulations about transboundary movement of CO 2.
      movement of
      CO2                  CO2 is not considered a waste under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their
                           Disposal (Basel Convention). The bilateral US/Canada Agreement on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste also does not
                           include CO2 as a waste, and, by extension, it may be inferred that at least in the bilateral relations between Canada and the U.S. CO 2 is
                           not regarded as a waste and certainly not as a hazardous waste.
                           Canada, US and Mexico signed a parallel agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to address environmental
                           issues. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) provides a process allowing members of the North
                           American public to make an assertion that a NAAEC country (“Party”) is f ailing to effectively enforce its environmental law. This
                           process is known as the Submissions on Enforcement Matters (SEM process). Therefore, only if the country's legislation does not
                           allow transboundary movements, the SEM process could be initiated.
                                                                      CO2 storage and usage

  15. Definitions and       The Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Act does not define storage or storage right. However, the Carbon Capture and Storage
      terminology           Statutes Amendment Act was amended to add “or sequestration” after storage.520
      applicable to
      CO2 storage
  16. Third-party           There is currently no regulation in Alberta directly dealing with third party access or open access to pore space or CO 2 sequestration.
      access to storage     There are, however, some portions of the Mines and Minerals Act and Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation that allow for the
      site                  transfer of tenure between parties, and that give the Minister of Energy the authority to reduce the area of a permit or lease upon
                            application of the permittee or lessee.

                            Surface access provisions for CCS projects are similar to those for other resources granted by the Surface Rights Act. A CCS operator
                            must obtain access permission from the surface owner, but if he cannot obtain consent he may apply to the Surface Rights Board for a
                            right of entry order521.
  17. Authorization of      Exploration activities firstly require coming to an agreement with the land owner through direct negotiation similar to oil and gas
      storage site          activities.
      exploration           The Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation allows operators to acquire a permit for the evaluation of a potential storage site to
      activities            investigate the geology and determine the suitability of the site for CO 2 sequestration522. The evaluation permit is defined as a form of
                            tenure granted by Alberta Energy that grants the right to conduct evaluations and testing into deep subsurface reservoirs to evaluate
                            their suitability for CO2 sequestration. The duration of an evaluation permit is 5 years from the term commencement date shown in the
                            permit.523
  18. Regulating site       The site selection and characterization period is a first stage in CCS projects. It begins when a proponent applies for a tenure agreement
      selection and         for the chosen site and includes granting of all initial regulatory approvals required.
      characterisation
      activities            Exploration and production of oil and natural gas has also provided industry and government with knowledge of the subsurface
                            geology of the province. This knowledge will enable the most suitable sites to be chosen for CO 2 sequestration524. In order to choose
                            sites that best meet the parameters above, proponents will review existing data from oil and gas exploration and production activities
                            and may gather new data. The data compiled for site selection may form part of the baseline data set in the monitoring, measurement
                            and verification (MMV) plan that will be developed for the project525.

                            After a project proponent acquires pore space tenure for CO 2 sequestration, they must acquire approvals from the AER to drill wells

                           and to operate a CO2 injection scheme. Approval for the operation of a CCS scheme in Alberta is the responsibility of the AER under
                           the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. AER Directive 065 currently requires an applicant to have all proposed injection wells completed
                           and test results available prior to scheme approval526.

                           Injection wells must also meet the requirements of Directive 051 which classified as Class III wells under Directive 051. The Class III
                           well classification covers a wide range of fluids and project activities. Directive 051 also clarifies completion, logging, testing,
                           monitoring, and application requirements for injection and disposal wells, and specifies procedures designed to protect the subsurface
                           environment, including potable groundwater and hydrocarbon-bearing zones.

                           Prior to the AER providing final approval for schemes for CO 2 sequestration, the application is transferred to the Minister of Alberta
                           Environment and Sustainable Resource development for review and approval. As part of this review the Minister may impose
                           additional conditions. Once final approval is obtained from the ERCB the project can commence subject to conditions and regulatory
                           requirements527.
  19. Authorization of     There are two aspects of the CO2 storage component that need to be considered separately for permitting requirements: (i) the CO 2
      storage activities   injection wells and, (ii) the CO2 subsurface storage scheme.528

                           Prior to construction of the CO2 injection wells for the Project, the following permits and approvals will be required 529:
                               - Well licence application in accordance with ERCB Directive 056: Energy Development Applications and Schedules
                               - Historical Resources Act: Clearance for the well pads and access roads from ACCS (received in 2011)
                               - Approval and compensation under the Alberta Water Act from AEW for any permanent disturbances from well pads or access
                                     roads to Class III or higher wetlands or waterbodies.

                           Section 116 of the Mines and Minerals Act establishes the ability of the Minister to grant the right to inject captured CO2 into a
                           subsurface reservoir for sequestration. 530 T Section 116 (3) sets out a number of requirements for lessees under such agreements,
                           including requirements to:
                           1. submit a MMV plan for approval, comply with the plan once approved, and provide reports with respect to such compliance;
                           2. submit a closure plan for approval, and comply with the plan once approved; and
                           3. make payments into the Post-Closure Stewardship Fund established under section 122, in accordance with the regulations.

                           Initial closure plans must be submitted when applying for a carbon sequestration lease and the plan must be updated every three years

                               Section 117 sets out a prohibition on injecting captured CO 2 into a subsurface reservoir under an agreement unless injection is
                               conducted in accordance with the agreement and other relevant laws.

                               Section 54 sets out a general prohibition on injection without authorisation, while section 116(2) requires lessees to obtain a well
                               licence and approval of the Energy Resources Conservation Board prior to drilling or using a well.

                               Sections 5 and 124 of the Act enable the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations respecting:
                               1. development and operation of injection wells and facilities;
                               2. risk assessment requirements; and
                               3. injection of captured CO2.
  20. International            Canada is part of the following international marine agreements relevant for CCS projects:
      laws for the                  - Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention)
      protection of the                  and the related 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
      marine                             Matter, 1972, (the 1996 Protocol). Consistent with the London Convention, the CEPA controls disposal of substances into
      environment.                       waters or onto ice from activities taking place at sea by way of a legislated general prohibition. This means that disposal of
                                         any substance into the sea or even into the sub-seabed from a ship, aircraft platform or other structure is not allowed unless it
                                         is done in accordance with a permit issued by Environment Canada (EC) 531.
  21. Project                  The Mines and Minerals Act entitles the Minister, or a person designated by the Minister, to investigate or inspect any well,
      inspections              installation, equipment or other facility used or formerly used in connection with the injection of a substance into a subsurface reservoir
                               for sequestration532. This Act provides for entry and access to relevant sites, and sets out requirements for lessees, operators and other
                               parties to render assistance, supply information and samples, and provide access to any reports, plans, logs and other information533.
                               Also, the proposed Directive 051 update would prescribe many of the requirements and detail the required frequency for hydraulic
                               isolation and casing inspection logging. Monitoring requirements for the storage complex are being addressed by the MMV. 534
  22. Monitoring,              The Minister of Energy is responsible for the approval of Monitoring, Measure and Verification (MMV) and closure plans, as part of
      reporting and            the tenure application process. These plans are an important component of the application package that is submitted to Alberta Energy
      verification             as they contain pertinent information to transmit its decision on allocation of pore space tenure, including information related to
      (MRV)                    potential impacts on other mineral resources.535

       requirements         Updated MMV plans are submitted every three years along with an updated closure plan. Monitoring technologies are evaluated during
                            the injection period to ensure effectiveness. Results will also be incorporated into simulations and models so that actual and predicted
                            behaviour can be compared and the MMV plan can be updated as necessary. This process will enable a systematic improvement of
                            model predictive capability throughout the injection period 536.

                            The Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation presently requires an annual report to the Minister of Energy containing the findings and
                            observations from MMV activities conducted for carbon sequestration lease holders 537.

                            When applying for a carbon sequestration lease, under the Carbon Sequestration Tenure Regulation, applicants are required to submit
                            an initial closure plan and a monitoring, measurement and verification (MMV) plan. 538

                            During the injection period, monitoring is undertaken to demonstrate compliance with legislation, applications and approvals. At this
                            point, data is gathered to demonstrate containment, conformance and use of the pore space.539

      measures and          However, the Mines and Minerals Act empowers the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations respecting remedial actions
      remediation           that a lessee must undertake, including540:
      measures                  1. circumstances under which a remedial action plan must be prepared and submitted;
                                2. the form, contents, submission, approval and amendment of plans; and
                                3. reporting requirements.

                            Section 60 of the Mines and Minerals Act, which is set out in the general provisions of the Act, provides that if the Minister has reason
                            to believe that operations are exposing others to the risk of damage or loss, the Minister can authorise any person to enter and remain at
                            the relevant site for the purposes of:
                                1. remedying existing defaults;
                                2. enforcing compliance with any safety provisions required to eliminate the risk of damage or loss; and
                                3. charge and collect from the lessee any expenses incurred.
                            Once a CO2 sequestration project is closed, and ownership and liability for the CO 2 has been transferred to the Government of Alberta,
                            the province will be responsible for conducting post-closure monitoring and any potential remediation. The degree and type of post-

      period                   party’s CO2, and not allow other operators into the storage site, liability (including PCSF payments) for the CO2 should continue to rest
                               with the tenure holder.542 Any costs associated with this liability and PCSF payments can be recovered through compensation paid by
                               the third party for injecting its CO2. Companies should be permitted to enter into private agreements to share liability burdens.
                               However, it is important that the Government of Alberta and landowners have complete certainty that they only need to deal with a
                               single legal entity regarding liability for an operation, and that entity is the tenure holder. 543
  25. Liability during         The Mines and Minerals Act sets out the liabilities and obligations that the Government of Alberta will assume when it issues a closure
      the post-closure         certificate. Since the tenure application starts the closure process when the lessees summit an initial closure plan; it continues with
      period                   interim closure plans submit every three years in the injection period; and the final closure plan which is submitted to enter the closure
                               period. To conclude, the final closure and MMV report that are submitted as part of closure certificate application. 544

                               The Government of Alberta will assume ownership and responsibility for injected CO 2, and any of the associated risks. At the end of a
                               project, a closure certificate is required to close a site and transfer long-term liability to the Government of Alberta545.
  26. Financial                In 2010, Carbon Capture and Storage Statutes Amendment Act created the Post-closure Stewardship Fund (PCSF) which assumes
      contributions to         certain liabilities and obligations of the lessee upon the issuance of a closure certificate. The PCSF was established to cover the costs
      post-closure             associated with some of those assumed liabilities and obligations in the post-closure period, and to protect the Alberta public from
      stewardship              bearing those costs546.

                               The Mines and Minerals Act establishes the PCSF and sets out the allowable uses 547. Currently, the PCSF can be used for monitoring
                               injected CO2, paying for expenses related to orphan facilities and fulfilling the other obligations assumed by the Government of Alberta
                               upon issuance of a closure certificate.

                               The Government of Alberta should set a PCSF rate (fee per tonne of injected CO 2) for each project individually. 548. This means the rate
                               would be calculated based only on the risks and cost obligations of each respective project. The rate for a project would not be changed
                               directly as a result of withdrawals from the fund to cover costs associated with other projects.

                           Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 2012), an environmental assessment focuses on potential adverse
                           environmental effects that are within federal jurisdiction, including: fish and fish habitat; other aquatic species; migratory birds; federal
                           lands; effects that cross provincial or international boundaries; effects that impact on Aboriginal peoples, such as their use of lands and
                           resources for traditional purposes; changes to the environment that are directly linked to or necessarily incidental to any federal
                           decisions about a project. An environmental assessment will consider a comprehensive set of factors that include cumulative effects,
                           mitigation measures and comments received from the public.554

                           Proponents must provide to the Agency a description of their proposed project if it is captured by regulations outlining projects likely
                           to require federal environmental assessment. Upon receipt of the proponent’s complete projec t description, the Agency has 45 days to
                           determine if a federal environmental assessment will be required. 555

                           The responsibility for conducting an environmental assessment rests with 556:
                                   the National Energy Board (for international and interprovincial pipelines and transmission lines); or
                                 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (for all other designated projects).
                           CEAA 2012 provides opportunities for public participation throughout the environmental assessment process. Cooperation and
                           communication with Aboriginal peoples with respect to environmental assessment is a key component of CEAA 2012. 557 The
                           definition of “environmental effects” includes provisions that explicitly relate to Aboriginal peoples and environmental effe cts that
                           cause changes to their: health and socio-economic conditions; physical and cultural heritage; current use of land and resources for
                           traditional purposes; or structures, sites or things that are of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance.558
  31. Pollution            CCS environmental pollution is regulated by the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) which prohibits the release
      prevention           of a substance in an amount that may cause a significant adverse effect, especially in matters of air contaminants, hazardous waste
      requirements         chemicals, ozone depleting substances, and water contaminants.
      (air, water)

  32. Nature               Protected species
      legislation          There is no specific mention of protected habitats and species. A CCS project would have specific authorizations on a case-by-case

      schemes             in the Alberta offset system are referred to as ‘Alberta -based offset credits’ or Verified Emissions Reductions or Removals (VERRs)
                          and are measured in units of metric tons of CO 2e559.
  36. Protecting          AER Directive 071 outlines the requirements for a corporate-level emergency response plan (ERP) and stipulates that these plans must
      human health        have pre-planned procedures that will aid in effective response to an emergency. An ERP for a CCS project does not currently require
                          approval from the regulator. However, the regulator may review the ERP upon request. 560

                          An emergency planning zone (EPZ) is a geographical area surrounding a well, pipeline or facility containing a hazardous product that
                          requires specific emergency response planning by the licensee. The licensee is required to carry out notification and education for the
                          public that lives within the EPZ.561

                          There are no requirements for the submission of a risk assessment of CO 2 sequestration projects in Alberta legislation. However, the
                          Mines and Minerals Act allows for the creation of regulations that require applicants to conduct risk assessments before being granted
                          an agreement for CO2 sequestration.562

                                Schedule II to the Hazardous Product Act (Canada) is designated as a “controlled product.” Thi s includes Class A – Compressed
                                Gas, defined as any product, material or substance contained under pressure, including compressed gas, dissolved gas or gas
                                liquefied by compression or refrigeration, and therefore likely encompasses CO 2.
                            -   Under the Occupational Health and Safety Code 2009 (OHSC), “controlled product” and “harmful substance” have the same
                                meaning as in the OHSR. “Hazard” means a situation, condition or object that may be dangerous to the safety or health of work ers.
                                “Hazardous waste” means a controlled product that is intended for disposal, or is sold for pressure that is intended for disposal
                                would qualify as hazardous waste for the purposes of Occupational Health and Safety. CO 2 would likely qualify as hazardous
                                waste for this purpose.
  38. Sharing               The requirements of the four funded projects in Alberta serve as the main driver behind knowledge-sharing mechanisms. The
      knowledge and         Government of Alberta holds the position that a consistent approach is needed to be able to use the resulting knowledge, which means
      experience            that data from various projects with similar technology blocks must be comparable. 564 This requires standardised templates and
      through the           measures for the large number of key indicators that will be reported by each project.565 It will require a level of transparency and
      demonstration         openness that might be challenging to some groups. Agreement may be needed to address intellectual property issues. A common web-
      phase                 based technology platform should enable global access and utilisation of the collected data. Its design should be driven by the needs of
                            the global CCS community.566

                            of hazardous materials) would apply. Carbon dioxide is considered a Class 2.2 (non- flammable gas) hazardous material under the
                            USDOT regulations. Pursuant to these regulations special handling requirements are provided for transport of CO 2 by rail and on the

                            The USEPA considers that the management of CO2 streams under the specified conditions does not present a substantial risk to human
                            health, or the environment, and will encourage the deployment of CCS technologies in a safe and environmentally protective manner,
                            while also ensuring protection of underground sources of drinking water 573. In December 2013, USEPA conditionally excluded CO 2
                            captured from power plants and industrial sources and injected into UIC Class VI wells from RCRA hazardous waste regulation in a
                            pre-publication version of the rule574. The USEPA has also determined that CO2 injected into Class VI wells does not present a
                            substantial risk to human health or the environment and should be exempted from the regulation.
  2.   Property rights      Property rights vary depending on state regulation and are not always clearly regulated. In case of uncertainty, the state courts will have
                            the last decision.

                           Land for pipeline construction in the US is often leased from private landowners, or acquired through eminent domain where
                           landowners and pipeline sponsors are unable to reach agreement575.

                           Under existing precedent in many states, the surface estate owner is generally viewed not only as the owner of the surface land, but
                           also the land and strata overlying the severed mineral estate (Marquette Cement Min. Co. v. Oglesby Coal Co., 253 F. 107 (1918)).
                           Most importantly in the context of geological sequestration, the majority view in the US provides that the subsurface pore space, where
                           CO2 would likely be stored, belongs to the surface owner (USDOE, 2009). The State of Wyoming recently passed legislation explicitly
                           establishing the majority view as a rule of law in the state (H.B. 89 2008). Other states are considering similar legislation as well. Thus,
                           in many cases legal access to deep geological formations in the US would require either ownership of the surface estate overlying the
                           targeted formation, or lease rights from such owner 576.

                           In the absence of express language in the mineral grant, pore space ownership should remain with the surface owner despite severance.
                           However, the wording of the operative agreements must be evaluated to determine whether or not a broader conveyance occurred. This
                           conclusion is supported by a number of cases in other jurisdictions addressing ownership of storage space for natural gas. Gas storage
                           cases in Texas, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Michigan have all stated that the surface owner, and not a mineral rights
                           holder, retains ownership of pore space577.
  3.   Competition         The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) does not currently have a statutory or regulatory mechanism that directly addresses the
       with other users    assurances sought by current applicants for a non-competitive preference right to develop future CCS projects after initial site
       and preferential    characterization studies. Other applicants may seek the same assurances 578.

  4.   Composition of      CO2 stream is defined under the Code of Federal Regulations as the carbon dioxide that has been captured from an emission source
       the CO2 stream      (e.g. a power plant), plus incidental associated substances derived from the source materials and the capture process, and any
                           substances added to the stream to enable or improve the injection process. This definition does not apply to any carbon dioxide stream
                           that meets the definition of a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 26.579

  5.   Engaging the           Administrative procedure codes for most US states, and certainly for the Federal government, contain mechanisms by which
       public in              stakeholders can mount a legal challenge to state action with respect to the licencing or permitting of major projects. Under the Federal
       decision making        Administrative Procedure Act (APA) a person “suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggriev ed by
                              agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute” is entitled to judicial review580.

                              Where a state is considering allowing the siting of a large-scale transportation project, public proceedings are likely to be held to obtain
                              public consultation. An example of such a process is the siting process for the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line where Virginia, West
                              Virginia, and Pennsylvania have held hearings to obtain public input on whether or not the Line would constitute useful development
                              for state citizens581.

                              CCS operators would need to obtain approval from tribal leaders in addition to the USEPA prior to injecting CO 2 on tribal lands.582 The
                              Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05) creates a mechanism by which Indian tribes may issue rights-of-way for pipelines (not to
                              exceed thirty years) on tribal lands without specific approval by the Secretary of the Interior 583.
  6.   Scope of               There are federal limitation of CCS projects:
       framework and          Oil and gas
       prohibitions           Oil and gas pipelines that obtain a “certificate of public convenience and necessity” under Federal law automatically receive eminent
                              domain.584 The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) provides that where a pipeline sponsor and a property owner cannot
                              agree to the terms of a right-of-way for the construction of a natural gas pipeline, the pipeline sponsor “may acquire the same by the
                              exercise of the right of eminent domain in state or Federal court” 585.

                          Navigation
                          While not subject to the UIC Program, injection wells up to three miles offshore could become subject to regulation under the Marine
                          Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). The USEPA recently submitted to Congress proposed changes to MPRSA to
                          implement the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
                          (London Protocol). Among the proposed changes is a provision to allow for and regulate CO2 sequestration in sub-seabed geological
                          formations under the MPRSA588.

                          Mining
                          Sequestration would limit all possibility of extracting minerals from the same formation (USDOE, 2009). Therefore in exploring
                          potential sequestration sites, title searches and investigation as to ownership of mineral estates in the exploration area would be
                          necessary to limit liability to potential mineral estate owners 589.

                          CCS exploration might also focus on un-minable coal seams and/or saline (non-potable) water aquifers. However, it is not clear that a
                          coal seam or saline aquifer that is determined to be un-minable or unusable now, would remain so for the duration of sequestration 590.

                          Rights of indigenous peoples and other customary rights
                          The EPAct05 creates a mechanism by which Indian tribes may issue rights-of-way for pipelines (not to exceed thirty years) on tribal
                          lands without specific approval by the Secretary of the Interior591.
  7.   Definition of      There is no definition of CCS ready. However, the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) mechanism under the Clean Air Act
       ´CCS ready´        (administered by the EPA) could potentially act as a de-facto CCS ready policy. The BACT mechanism is an emissions limitation
                          required to reduce the emission of air pollutants from stationary sources, based on a case-by-case decision that takes into account
                          technical feasibility, cost, and other energy, environmental, and economic impacts 592.
  8.   Incentives for     Are range of measures were foreseen as incentives for CCS in the US593 in the 2009 ACES Act, also referred to the Waxman-Markey
       CCS as part of     Bill. The Act considered financial support for the first commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects to innovative technologies, loan
       climate            guarantees, awards bonus GHG cap-and-trade allowances to subsidize the cost of deploying CCS, etc. However, as this bill was

      strategies           The EPACT05 authorized clean coal investment tax credits that were authorized alongside new research spending and other financial
                           incentives, such as loan guarantees594. Additional tax incentives for clean coal were provided by the Emergency Economic Stabilization
                           Act of 2008 (EESA)595.

                           Finally, important funding for CCS project is provided by the US Department of Energy (US DOE). The Obama White House has
                           committed to providing financial assistance to a multitude of CCS projects across the United States. In February 2009, the American
                           Recovery and Reinvestment Act (AARA) designated $3.4 billion for CCS programs. This funding was broken down into three major
                           sources; $1.52 billion for a competitive bidding for industrial CCS projects, $800 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI),
                           and $1billion for FutureGen.596 Also the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) provides important funding to CCS project. The CCPI
                           aims at simultaneously protecting the environment and addressing the long-term reliability of the US energy supply. It is a public-
                           private cost sharing partnerships that aims to demonstrate commercial scale clean coal generation technologies. 597

                           On 13 April 2013, China and the US signed ‘the US -China Joint Statement on Climate Change’ in which the US -China Climate
                           Change Working Group (CCWG) was announced. The CCWG launched five action ini tiatives including ‘carbon capture, utilization
                           and storage’598

                           On August 3rd, 2015, president Obama and the USEPA announced the Clean Power Plan aiming to reduce carbon pollution from
                           power plants599. New Source Performance Standards set limits on emissions based on USEPA’s assessment of available technologies.
                           As with many other Clean Air Act programs, USEPA establishes a standard for a given category of facility, which state environmental
                           agencies then translate into requirements for individual facilities. EPA’s final "Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants" was
                           developed under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. Section 111(b) calls for a standard that "reflects the degree of emissions
                           limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emissions reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving

                            been adequately demonstrated." The emissions limit must take the form of a standard – in the case of power plants, maximum
                            allowable CO2 emissions per unit of electricity – and may not prescribe a particular technology. 600 USEPA justified its conclusion by
                            citing the experience to date in deploying CCS technology. This includes the successful launch of the world’s first commercial -scale
                            CCS power plant by SaskPower in Saskatchewan in 2014, two commercial-scale projects under construction in the United States in
                            Mississippi and Texas, a variety of CCS projects at industrial facilities, and numerous demonstration-scale CCS projects601.
                                                                            CO2 capture
  9.   Authorization        A national regulatory system explicitly applicable to CO2 capture has not yet been established. Meanwhile, existing US environmental
       for capture          laws have been evaluated for their application to CO2 capture602.

                            Where Federal agencies, such as the USDOE, are significantly involved with a CCS project or where such a project is subject to
                            regulation and/or permitting by Federal agencies, the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) could apply603.
                            NEPA requires agencies to prepare Environmental Impact Statements for “major Federal actions significantly affecting the huma n
                            environment"604. To the extent a CCS project triggers permit obligations under other environmental laws as described below, the
                            permitting agency could be required to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project 605.

                            Retrofitting an existing power plant with CCS technology could also trigger New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the Clean
                            Air Act (CAA)606. NSR is a preconstruction permitting program that governs new sources and major modifications to existing sources.
                            NSR requirements are triggered for modifications where there is a physical change or change in method of operation that results in a
                            significant net emissions increase607. NSR requirements will depend of net emissions variations and the location of a plant. In areas that
                            are in attainment with national ambient air quality standards, technologies would have to meet Best Available Techniques (BAT)608.

                            CO2 capture would also have to comply with applicable NSR. CCA requires the USEPA to establish Federal emission standards for
                            source categories that cause or contribute significantly to air pollution 609. Also, CCA stablishes the standards of performance for new
                            stationary sources610.

                            USEPA’s GHG Tailoring Rule, issued in May 2010, established a common sense approach to permitting GHG emissions under PSD
                            and Title V. The rule set initial emission thresholds - known as Steps 1 and 2 of the Tailoring Rule - for Prevention of Significant
                            Deterioration (PSD) and CCA Title V permitting based on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) emissions. EPA’s Step 3 of the GHG
                            Tailoring Rule, issued on June 29, 2012, continues to focus GHG permitting on the largest emitters by retaining the permitting
                            thresholds that were established in Steps 1 and 2. In addition, the Step 3 rule improves the usefulness of plant wide applicability
                            limitations (PALs) by allowing GHG PALs to be established on CO2e emissions, in addition to the already available mass emissions
                            PALs, and to use the CO2e-based applicability thresholds for GHGs provided in the "subject to regulation" definition in setting the
                            PAL on a CO2e basis. The rule also revises the PAL regulations to allow a source that emits or has the potential to emit at least 100,000
                            tons per year of CO2e, but that has minor source emissions of all other regulated NSR pollutants, to apply for a GHG PAL while still
                            maintaining its minor source status611.

                            Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), an applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in a discharge
                            to navigable waters must provide the Federal agency with a certification asserting compliance with water quality standards612.
                            Moreover, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System establishes permit requirements for certain discharges from industrial
                            sources, including storm water runoff from an industrial facility or construction site and wastewater discharges to a municipal sewer
                            systems.
  10. Monitoring,           The general monitoring requirements for industrial emissions regulated by the CAA would apply also to CO 2.
      reporting and
      verification          Federal regulations require each major source of air pollutant emissions to obtain an "operating permit" that consolidates all of the air
      (MMV)                 pollution control requirements into a single, comprehensive document covering all aspects of the source's air pollution activities. Air
      requirements          pollution permits are also required for businesses that build new pollution sources or make significant changes to existing pollution
                            sources. These are sometimes referred to as "preconstruction" or "new source review" permits.

                            Operating permits document how air pollution sources will monitor, either periodically or continuously, their compliance with
                            emission limits and all other applicable requirements on an on-going basis.

                            The CAA establishes the air permitting program for the federal government. Operating permits are legally enforceable documents that
                            permitting agencies issue to air pollution sources. The Federal regulations establish minimum standards for State permit programs

                            Indian and tribal lands and in other situations, as needed.
                            CFR Part 70 identifies the standard permit requirements that each permit shall include. The monitoring and related recordkeeping and
                            reporting requirements with respect to monitoring are the following613:
                                 All monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods required under applicable monitoring and testing requirements,
                                     including Compliance Assurance Monitoring614; and
                                 Where the applicable requirement does not require periodic testing or instrumental or non-instrumental monitoring (which
                                     may consist of recordkeeping designed to serve as monitoring), periodic monitoring sufficient to yield reliable data from the
                                     relevant time period that are representative of the source's compliance with the permit.
  11. Inspection            USEPA works with its federal, state and tribal regulatory partners to monitor and ensure compliance with clean air laws and
                            regulations in order to protect human health and the environment. The Clean Air Act (CAA) is the primary federal law governing air
                            pollution615.

                            USEPA’s CAA Stationary Source Compliance Monitoring Strategy (CMS) provides guidance to EPA and authorized states with
                            respect to administering and implementing an Agency program for CAA compliance monitoring 616.
                            EPA and authorized states make decisions about compliance monitoring based on 617:
                                     implementing an EPA or state plan, or
                                     "for cause" - that is:
                                               as a result of tips complaints, or
                                               as a follow-up to previous monitoring activities.

       (pipeline             discussed below. Many state administrative codes require a pipeline to be licenced or permitted prior to operation. For example, in
       regulations, etc.)    Texas such permits are issued by the State Railroad Commission for proposed pipelines (16 Tex. Code § 3.70). In New Mexico, the
                             State Public Regulation Commission requires pipeline operators to apply for a licence and pay a fee for each new fiscal year (NM Code
                             § 70-3-2). An interstate CO2 pipeline in the US therefore could be required to hold permits in each state that it transects 619.

                             Siting and rate-setting for new pipelines other than CO2 pipelines in the US is generally regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
                             Commission (FERC) and the Surface Transportation Board (STB). However, both FERC and the STB, have specifically disclaimed
                             jurisdiction over CO2 pipelines under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) respectively.
                             Because these agencies have disclaimed jurisdiction, Federal approval is not required to construct new CO 2 pipelines in the US. At the
                             same time, this means that the Federal government will not use its eminent domain authority for CO 2 pipeline construction620.

                             An exception to this rule is found where CO2 pipelines are sited on Federal lands. The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
                             has the authority to grant rights of way to CO2 pipelines on Federal lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act
                             (FLPMA) or the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) 621.

                             Existing pipelines
                             Existing pipelines must remain in compliance with any permit or licence conditions established at the State level, as well as pipeline
                             safety regulations established by the USDOT Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 622.

                             Road and rail transport
                             To the extent CO2 is transported via either road or rail in the United States, the USDOT’s regulations related to transportation of
                             hazardous materials would apply. Carbon dioxide is considered a Class 2.2 (non-flammable gas) hazardous material under the USDOT
                             regulations623. Pursuant to these regulations special handling requirements are provided for transport of CO 2 by rail624 and on the
                             highway625. The USDOT also imposes certain requirements on transportation of hazardous materials by vessel 626.

                             Offshore pipelines
                             Offshore pipelines are regulated by both OPS and the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency of the United States
                             Department of Interior (USDOI)627.

  14. Transboundary         Basel Convention628
      movement of           The Basel Convention is intended to establish a global regime for the control of international trade in hazardous wastes. The
      CO2                   Convention does not create a blanket prohibition on the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes; instead it establishes guiding
                            rules, and in some cases detailed conditions, for the regulation of it. However, the US has not yet ratified the Basel Convention.

                            North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation629
                            Canada, US and Mexico signed a parallel agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to address environmental
                            issues. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) provides a process allowing members of the North
                            American public to make an assertion that a NAAEC c ountry (“Party”) is failing to enforce effectively its environmental law. This
                            process is known as the Submissions on Enforcement Matters (SEM process). Therefore, only if the country's legislation does not
                            allow transboundary movements, the SEM process could be initiated.
                                                                      CO2 storage and usage
  15. Definitions and       Title 40 of Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR) has the following legal definitions relating to CO 2 storage630:
      terminology                 Area of Review (AoR) means the region surrounding the geologic sequestration project where USDWs may be endangered by
      applicable to                  the injection activity. The AoR is delineated using computational modelling that accounts for the physical and chemical
      CO2 storage                    properties of all phases of the injected carbon dioxide stream and displaced fluids, and is based on available site
                                     characterization, monitoring, and operational data.
                                  Geologic sequestration (GS): The long-term containment of a gaseous, liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide stream in
                                     subsurface geologic formations. This term does not apply to CO2 capture or transport.
                                  Geologic sequestration project: For the purpose of this regulation, an injection well or wells used to emplace a carbon dioxide
                                     stream beneath the lowermost formation containing an underground sources of drinking water (USDW); or wells used for
                                     geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements; or wells used for
                                     geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II Enhanced
                                     Oil or Gas Recovery (EOR/EGR) aquifer exemption. It includes the subsurface three-dimensional extent of the carbon dioxide
                                     plume, associated area of elevated pressure, and displaced fluids, as well as the surface area above that delineated region.
                                  Injectate: The fluids injected. For the purposes of this rule, this is also known as the CO 2 stream.
                                  Injection zone: A geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is of sufficient areal extent, thickness,

                                  Pore space: Open spaces in rock or soil. These are filled with water or other fluids such as brine (i.e., salty fluid). CO 2 injected
                                   into the subsurface can displace pre-existing fluids to occupy some of the pore spaces of the rocks in the injection zone.
                                  Post-injection site care: Appropriate monitoring and other actions (including corrective action) needed following cessation of

                          as the need for careful scientific evaluation of subsurface geologic formations which are not impaired or altered by competing uses, it is
                          not in the public interest to allow competing permittees to test within the same permit area. The BLM does retain the right to authorize
                          other compatible uses of the public lands within the permit area 634. However, no additional competing CO2 GS exploration and site
                          characterization permits will be authorized within the permit area during the term of the permit.

                          Regulations require compliance with air and water quality standards established pursuant to applicable Federal or State law and State
                          standards for public health and safety, environmental protection, siting, construction, operation, and maintenance if those standards are
                          more stringent than applicable Federal standards635. Exploration and site characterization permits will result in some sites being found
                          unsuitable for future CO2 GS projects. Any related linear utilities proposed on public land outside the permit area, such as pipelines or
                          power lines, will require separate applications and, if approved, will be authorized by separate right-of-way grants using existing
                          procedures of rights-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act636. Legal access will be considered ancillary to the primary permit and
                          authorized as part of the permit. All activities associated with CO 2 GS exploration and site characterization studies on public land, no
                          matter the type of authorization(s), will be subject to land use plan conformance determinations and appropriate NEPA compliance.637
  18. Regulating site     Owners or operators must gather the data necessary to demonstrate site suitability and submit this with a Class VI permit application to
      selection and       be evaluated by the UIC Program Director prior to receiving authorization to construct the well, and must update and gather more

      activities
                          The site characterization process typically includes a general characterization of regional and site geology, followed by detailed
                          characterization of the injection zone and confining zones. The more general characterization includes data on the regional geology and
                          hydrogeology, supported by maps, cross sections, and other available data. The more detailed information focuses on the proposed
                          project site and involves submission of data on stratigraphy, structural geology, hydrogeology, geomechanical properties, and
                          geochemistry. The initial stage includes compiling pre-existing and/or new information, maps, cross sections, geochemical and
                          petrophysical data, and geophysical or remote sensing information. Final site characterization data will be collected as the injection
                          well is drilled, core samples are taken and analyzed, and logs and tests are performed 639.

                          The Class VI Rule, at 40 CFR 146.83, establishes minimum criteria for the siting of Class VI wells. Specifically, Class VI wells must
                          be located in areas with a suitable geologic system, including:
                                The presence of an injection zone of sufficient areal extent, thickness, porosity, and permeability to receive the total
                                   anticipated volume of the carbon dioxide stream; and
                                The presence of confining zones that are free of transmissive faults or fractures and of sufficient areal extent and integrity to
                                   contain the carbon dioxide stream and displaced formation fluids and allow injection without initiating or propagating
                                   fractures.
                          Additionally, at the UIC Program Director’s discretion, owners or operators may be required to identify and characterize addi tional
                          confining zones to ensure USDW protection, impede vertical fluid movement, allow for pressure dissipation, and provide additional

                           The types of site characterization information specified by the Class VI Rule that must be provided with a Class VI well permit
                           application include:
                                 Maps and cross sections of the AoR;
                                 The location, orientation, and properties of known or suspected faults and fractures that may transect the confining zone(s) in
                                    the AoR, along with a determination that they will not interfere with containment;
                                 Data on the depth, areal extent, thickness, mineralogy, porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure of the injection and
                                    confining zone(s) and on lithology and facies changes;
                                 Geomechanical information on fractures, stress, ductility, rock strength, and in situ fluid pressures within the confining
                                    zone(s);
                                 Information on the seismic history of the area, including the presence and depths of seismic sources, and a determination that
                                    the seismicity will not interfere with containment;
                                 Geologic and topographic maps and cross sections illustrating regional geology, hydrogeology, and the geologic structure of
                                    the local area;
                                 Maps and stratigraphic cross sections indicating the general vertical and lateral limits of all USDWs, water wells, and springs
                                    within the AoR, their positions relative to the injection zone(s), and the direction of water movement (where known);
                                 Baseline geochemical data on subsurface formations, including all USDWs in the AoR.
  19. Authorization of     Owners or operators of Class VI wells must prepare five project plans and submit them to the UIC Program Director for approval with
      storage activities   their Class VI permit application. When the plans are approved, they become an enforceable part of the Class VI permit. The required
                           project plans, which must be based on site-specific information, include the following 640:

                               1.   (AoR and Corrective Action Plan: This plan describes how an owner or operator intends to delineate the AoR for the Class VI
                                    injection well and ensure that all identified deficient artificial penetrations (i.e., wells that are improperly plugged or
                                    completed) will be addressed by corrective action techniques so that they will not become conduits for fluid movement into
                                    underground sources of drinking water (USDWs).

                               2.   Testing and Monitoring Plan: This plan describes how the owner or operator intends to perform all necessary testing and
                                    monitoring associated with a GS project, including injectate monitoring, performing mechanical integrity tests (MITs),
                                    corrosion monitoring, tracking the carbon dioxide plume and area of elevated pressure, monitoring geochemical changes
                                    above the confining zone, and, at the discretion of the UIC Program Director, surface air and/or soil gas monitoring for carbon
                                    dioxide fluctuations and any additional tests necessary to ensure USDW protection from endangerment.

                                       plug the Class VI injection well using the appropriate materials and methods to ensure that the well will not become a conduit
                                       for fluid movement into USDWs in the future.

                                  4.   Post-Injection Site Care (PISC) and Site Closure Plan: This plan describes how the owner or operator intends to monitor the
                                       site after injection has ceased, in order to ensure that the carbon dioxide plume and pressure front are moving as predicted and
                                       USDWs are not endangered. PISC monitoring must continue until it can be demonstrated that the site poses no further
                                       endangerment to USDWs.
                                  5.   Emergency and Remedial Response Plan: This plan describes the actions that the owner or operator intends to take in the
                                       event of movement of the injectate or formation fluids in a manner that may cause an endangerment to a USDW, including the
                                       appropriate people to contact.

                              These five GS project plans, which are reviewed as part of the Class VI permit application review and approval process and
                              incorporated into the Class VI permit, must be amended periodically, as specified in the Class VI Rule.
  20. International           London Convention and Protocol641
      laws for the            The London Convention covers the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms, and other man-
      protection of the       made structures at sea. The London Convention has 80 parties and has been very successful in combating marine pollution from
      marine                  dumping. The US ratified the London Convention in 1975. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) is the US
      environment.            law that implements this treaty.

                              In 1992, the parties to the London Convention began a comprehensive review of the Convention, resulting in a new treaty called the
                              1996 Protocol. The London Protocol has been interpreted by contracting parties as prohibiting the export of CO 2 from a contracting
                              party to other countries for injection into sub‐seabed geological formations. However, the London Protocol has been interpreted by
                              contracting parties as prohibiting the export of CO 2 from a contracting party to other countries for injection into sub ‐seabed geological
                              formations. The US signed the Protocol in 1998, but has not yet ratified it.
  21. Project                 USEPA proposed annual external Mechanical Integrity Testing (MIT) using a tracer survey, a temperature or noise log, a casing
      inspections             inspection log, or any other test the Director requires. USEPA sought comments on the appropriate frequency and types of MITs for
                              Class VI wells. In general, commenters requested flexibility in methods and timing of testing, with some suggesting a five-year
                              frequency for external MIT.

                              Because GS is a new technology and there are a number of unknowns associated with the long-term effects of injecting large volumes
                              of CO2, today's rule requires owners or operators of CO 2 injection wells to demonstrate external MI at least once annually during
                              injection operations using a tracer survey or a temperature or noise log 642. This increase in required testing frequency relative to other
                              injection well classes ensures the protection of USDWs from endangerment given the potential corrosive effects of CO 2 (in the

                                                                                                                                                                     279
                            presence of water) on well components (steel casing and cement) and the buoyant nature of supercritical CO 2 relative to formation
                            brines, which could enable it to migrate up a compromised wellbore. The Director may also authorize an alternate test of external
                            mechanical integrity with the approval of EPA643.

                            In addition, the Class VI Rule allows the Director discretion to require use of casing inspection logs to determine the presence or
                            absence of any casing corrosion644. To ensure the appropriate application of this test and to afford flexibility to owners or operators and
                            Directors, the Class VI Rule requires that the frequency of this test be established based on site-specific and well-specific conditions
                            and incorporated into the testing and monitoring plan if the Director requires such testing. This modification is made to clarify that
                            such logs, while not used to directly assess mechanical integrity, may be used to measure for corrosion of the long-string casing and
                            thus may serve as a useful predictor of potential mechanical integrity problems in the future.
  22. Monitoring,           The Class VI Rule requires owners or operators of Class VI wells to perform several types of activities during the lifetime of the
      reporting and         project in order to ensure that the injection well maintains its mechanical integrity, that fluid migration and the extent of pressure
      verification          elevation are within the limits described in the permit application, and that USDWs are not endangered 645.
      requirements
                            Testing and monitoring of GS sites is integral to the protection of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). Testing and
                            monitoring:
                                 Is required to determine whether the GS projects are operating as permitted.
                                 Can detect risks that may lead to the endangerment of USDWs.
                                 Is needed to inform reevaluation of the area of AoR for Class VI projects646, to ensure accurate delineation of the region
                                     surrounding the injection well(s) where the potential exists for USDWs to be endangered by the leakage of injectate and/or
                                     formation fluids.
                            The testing and monitoring activities that are primarily required during the injection phase are the following:
                                 Injection-phase testing and monitoring activities required under the Class VI Rule include: Analysis of the carbon dioxide

                               computational modeling of the AoR and to determine compliance with standards655.

                      The Post-Injection Site Care (PISC) refers to the time period immediately following cessation of injection until site closure. Although
                      there is no longer injection during this phase, the project still poses some risk to USDWs due to elevated pressures and the presence of
                      mobile-phase carbon dioxide. Owners or operators of Class VI wells must prepare, maintain, and comply with a PISC and Site Closure
                      Plan656. Specifically, owners or operators must monitor the site to show the position of the carbon dioxide plume and pressure front and
                      demonstrate that USDWs are not endangered during the approved PISC monitoring timeframe 657. The purpose of these requirements is
                      to ensure that any risk to USDWs is detected and appropriate remediation/corrective action is taken in the case of endangerment 658.

                                                                                                                                                          281
                         Site closure refers to the procedures and period immediately following PISC, when an owner or operator must plug and abandon all
                         monitoring wells to enable the end of the Class VI project and termination of the permit659. Site closure commences only when there is
                         no longer risk of endangerment to USDWs and when authorized by the UIC Program Director. Site closure regulations are established
                         to ensure that all PISC monitoring wells are plugged appropriately and to the UIC Program Director’s satisfaction, that all project
                         records are maintained, and that future land owners are made aware of the project and previous land use. 660
  23. Corrective         The owner or operator of a Class VI well must prepare, maintain, and comply with a plan to delineate the area of review for a proposed
      measures and       geologic sequestration project, periodically re-evaluate the delineation, and perform corrective action that meets the requirements. The
      remediation        area of review is that within which the owner or operator must identify all penetrations (regardless of property ownership) in the
      measures           injection zone and determine whether they have been properly completed or plugged 661.

                         These requirements to maintain and implement an approved plan is directly enforceable regardless of whether the requirement is a
                         condition of the permit. As a part of the permit application for approval of the project, the owner or operator must submit an area of
                         review and corrective action plan662.

                         The purpose of AoR delineation for a proposed GS project is to determine the area where any geologic features or artificial
                         penetrations (e.g., wells) may become conduits for fluid movement out of the injection zone, or additional zones, and potentially cause
                         endangerment to a USDW. Artificial penetrations include any man-made structures, such as wells or mines, which provide a flow path
                         out of the injection zone. The Class VI Rule requires that the owner or operator prepare, maintain, and implement an AoR and
                         Corrective Action Plan that includes a description of how corrective action will be performed on any artificial penetrations through the
                         confining zone and whether such action will be phased 663.
  24. Liability during   CO2 itself is not listed as a hazardous substance under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
      the project        (CERCLA). However, the CO2 stream may contain a listed hazardous substance (such as mercury) or may mobilize substances in the
      period             subsurface that could react with ground water to produce listed hazardous substances (such as sulphuric acid). Whether such substances
                         may result in CERCLA liability from a GS facility depends entirely on the composition of the specific CO 2 stream and the
                         environmental media in which it is stored (e.g., soil or ground water). CERCLA exempts from liability under CERCLA section 107, 42
                         U.S.C. 9607, certain “Federally permitted releases” (FPR) as defined in CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9601(10), which would include the
                         permitted injectate stream as long as it is injected and behaves in accordance with the permit requirements. Class VI permits will need
                         to be carefully structured to ensure that they prevent potential releases from the well, which are outside the scope of the Class VI

  25. Liability during       Long-term liability and stewardship for GS projects under the SDWA 664
      the post-closure       Under current SDWA provisions USEPA does not have authority to transfer liability from one entity (i.e., owner or operator) to
      period                 another. Under SDWA authority, owners or operators of injection wells must ensure protection of USDWs from endangerment and
                             are subject to liability for enforcement under the Act. Class VI Rule requires that an owner or operator must conduct monitoring as
                             specified in the Director-approved PISC and site closure plan following the cessation of injection until the owner or operator can
                             demonstrate to the Director that the geologic sequestration project no longer poses an endangerment to USDWs.

                             Once an owner or operator has met all regulatory requirements under Section 146 for Class VI wells and the Director has approved site
                             closure pursuant to requirements at Section 146.93, the owner or operator will generally no longer be subject to enforcement under
                             section 1423 of SDWA for noncompliance with UIC regulatory requirements. However, an owner or operator may be held liable for
                             regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances even after site closure is approved under Section 146.93, under Section 1423 of
                             the SDWA for violating Section 144.12, such as where the owner or operator provided erroneous data to support approval of site
                             closure.

                             Additionally, an owner or operator may always be subject to an order the Administrator deems necessary to protect the health of
                             persons under Section 1431 of the SDWA after site closure if there is fluid migration that causes or threatens imminent and substantial
                             endangerment to a USDW. For example, the Administrator may issue a SDWA section 1431 order if a well may present an imminent
                             and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, and the State and local authorities have not acted to protect the health of such
                             persons. The order may include commencing a civil action for appropriate relief. If the owner or operator fails to comply with the
                             order, they may be subject to a civil penalty for each day in which such violation occur or failure to comply continues.

                             Furthermore, after site closure, an owner or operator may, depending on the fact scenario, remain liable under tort and other remedies,
                             or under other Statutes including, but not limited to, Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401-7671; CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. Sections
                             9601-9675; and RCRA, 42 U.S.C. Sections 6901-6992.
  26. Financial              Regulation retains the substantive requirements that owners or operators of Class VI wells demonstrate and maintain financial
      contributions to       responsibility to cover the cost of corrective action, injection well plugging, PISC and site closure, and emergency and remedial
      post-closure           response. The Class VI Rule665 identifies the following qualifying financial instruments for Class VI wells, all of which must be
      stewardship            sufficient to address endangerment of USDWs.
                                  1. Trust Funds: If using a trust fund, owners or operators are required to set aside funds with a third party trustee sufficient to
                                      cover estimated costs. During the financial responsibility demonstration, the owner or operator may be required to deposit the
                                      required amount of money into the trust prior to the start of injection or during the “pay-in period” if authorized by the
                                      Director.
                                  2. Surety Bond: Owners or operators may use a payment surety bond or a performance surety bond to guarantee that financial

                                     responsibility will be fulfilled. In case of operator default, a payment surety bond funds a standby trust fund in the amount
                                     equal to the face value of the bond and sufficient to cover estimated costs, and a performance surety bond guarantees
                                     performance of the specific activity or payment of an amount equivalent to the estimated costs into a standby trust fund.
                                 3. Letter of Credit: A letter of credit is a credit document, issued by a financial institution, guaranteeing that a specific amount of
                                     money will be available to a designated party under certain conditions. In case of operator default, letters of credit fund
                                     standby trust funds in an amount sufficient to cover estimated costs.
                                 4. Insurance: The owner or operator may obtain an insurance policy to cover the estimated costs of GS activities requiring
                                     financial responsibility. This insurance policy must be obtained from a third party to decrease the possibility of failure (i.e.,
                                     non-captive insurer).
                                 5. Self-Insurance (i.e., Financial Test and Corporate Guarantee): Owners or operators may self-insure through a financial test
                                     provided certain conditions are met. The owner or operator needs to pass a financial test to demonstrate profitability, with a
                                     margin sufficient to cover contingencies and unknown obligations, and stability. If the owner or operator meets corporate
                                     financial test criteria, this is an indication that the owner or operator can guarantee its ability to satisfy financial obligations
                                     based solely on the strength of the company's financial condition. An owner or operator who is not able to meet corporate
                                     financial test criteria may arrange a corporate guarantee by demonstrating that its corporate parent meets the financial test
                                     requirements on its behalf. The parent's demonstration that it meets the financial test requirement is insufficient if it has not
                                     also guaranteed to fulfil the obligations for the owner or operator.
                                 6. Escrow Account: Owners or operators may deposit money to an escrow account to cover financial responsibility requirements.
                                     This account must segregate funds sufficient to cover estimated costs for GS financial responsibility from other accounts and
                                     uses.
                            Other instrument(s) satisfactory to the Director: In addition to these instruments, EPA anticipates that new instruments that may be
                            tailored to meet GS needs may emerge, and may be determined appropriate for use by the Director for the purpose of financial
                            responsibility demonstrations.

      recovery with         draft, owners or operators of Class II wells that inject CO2 for the primary purpose of long-term storage would be required to apply for
      CCS                   and obtain Class VI well permits if the UIC program director determines there is increased risk to underground sources of drinking
                            water. If a determination is made that a Class VI permit is needed, a number of requirements must be fulfilled, both at the time of re-
                            permitting and during future operations, including: ƒ well construction and operation ƒ geologic storage site testing and monitoring ƒ

  29. Planning             The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of plans, legislation and
      requirements         regulatory proposals and projects. NEPA does not list the types of plans and programmes subject to an SEA obligation, but provides
      (eg. Strategic       more general wording covering both legislation and any major Federal actions significantly affecting the human environment. Unlike
      environmental        the EU, NEPA does not distinguish between EIA and SEA.
      assessment)
  30. Environmental        NEPA requires agencies to prepare EIS for proposals for legislation and major Federal actions significantly affecting the human
      impact               environment667. “Major Federal actions” has been interpreted to encompass “actions with effects that may be major and which are
      assessment           potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility” 668. NEPA's is therefore considered to require that an environmental impact
                           assessment (EIA) be prepared for every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions
                           significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

                           Only public projects require preparation of an EIS, but because public projects include any activity financed, assisted, or regulated by a
                           federal agency, many "private" projects are considered public for purposes of NEPA. 669 Each federal agency excludes some projects
                           from the EIA process by its own procedures, because experience has shown that they do not significantly affect the environment. For
                           all other proposed actions the agency prepares a preliminary assessment to determine whether an EIS is required. 670 In the United
                           States, the EIA is prepared by an agency of the federal government.

                           NEPA requires that the EIS include information on: (1) the environmental impact of the proposed project; (2) any adverse
                           environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented; (3) the relationship between local short-term uses
                           of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and (4) any irreversible and irretrievable
                           commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented. NEPA regulations require that
                           these impacts be discussed for all alternatives identified in the EIS. 671 The EIS must also include appropriate mitigation measures. The
                           agency is not required to adopt mitigation measures, but it must state whether such measures have in fact been adopted, and if not, it
                           must explain why they were not.672 A commenting period is subsequently foreseen, after which the agency can decide whether to
                           authorize the project or proceed with the federal action covered by the EIS.

  32. Nature                The Endangered Species Act (ESA) enjoins the Federal government from taking any action that could jeopardize a listed endangered
      legislation           or threatened species in the US, or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat for such species (16 USC 1531). In order to trigger the
      requirements          requirements of the ESA, a CO2 pipeline would first have to impact a protected species or habitat. Second, there would have to be
      (consideration of     enough Federal involvement with the project, either through permitting or funding, to identify the project as a Federal action. If the
      protected             ESA did apply, the permitting or funding agency would be required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the
      habitats and          National Marine Fisheries, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On the basis of this consultation,
      species)              the consulting agencies would prepare a biological opinion to determine whether the project would jeopardize protected species or
                            habitat. If so, the action could be prohibited under the ESA 673.

                            Migratory Species
                            Executive Order 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds,” requires Federal agencies to avoid or
                            minimize the negative impacts of their action on migratory birds, and to take active steps to protect birds and their habitats 674.
  33. Waste legislation     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)675
      requirements          RCRA governs the disposal of solid and hazardous waste in the US. “Hazardous waste” is defined under th e Act as a solid waste that
                            poses a “substantial present or potential hazard to human health when improperly treated, stored, transported or, disposed of , or
                            otherwise managed”676.

                            Section 3001 of RCRA creates an exemption under the Act for waste generated through the combustion of coal and other fossil
                            fuels677. It is unclear whether this exemption might be extended to include excess waste generated by CO 2 capture operations at a coal
                            combustion facility. If CCS projects were required to hold permits under RCRA for excess waste generated from capture it would
                            impose significant additional costs on CCS projects. This seems unlikely, however, given that excess waste from CO 2 capture is not
                            expected to be substantially more hazardous than the coal combustion waste already generated by power plants.
  34. Coastal and           While not subject to the UIC Program, injection wells, up to three miles offshore, could become subject to regulation under the Marine
      marine                Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). The USEPA recently submitted to Congress proposed changes to MPRSA to
      protection            implement the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter

                        formations under the MPRSA678.
  35. Coverage by       In the US there is no Federal-level mechanism currently to impose a cost on GHG emissions. Instead, there are mandatory and
      GHG trading       voluntary cap-and-trade programs. Examples of mandatory programs are the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is
      schemes           integrated by the north-eastern states, and Western Climate Initiative. Meanwhile, Chicago Climate Exchange, and American Carbon
                        Registry are examples of voluntary programs 679.

                        Numerous US States have implemented their own mandatory GHG reporting rules. Many States are requiring GHG reporting from all
                        facilities that hold permits for air emissions under Title V of the CAA. These States include Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts,
                        Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Oregon 680.
  36. Protecting        An owner or operator may always be subject to an order the USEPA deems necessary to protect the health of persons under SDWA
      human health      after site closure if there is fluid migration that causes or threatens imminent and substantial endangerment to a USDW. For example,
                        the Administrator may issue a SDWA section 1431 order if a well may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health
                        of persons, and the State and local authorities have not acted to protect the health of such persons. 681 The order may include
                        commencing a civil action for appropriate relief. If the owner or operator fails to comply with the order, they may be subject to a civil
                        penalty for each day in which such violation occur or failure to comply continues.

                        The World Resources Institute considers that successful site closure should entail no migration or release of CO 2 from closed sites
                        through geological or engineering hazards that could compromise human health or safety. For all storage projects, a risk assessment
                        should be required, along with the development and implementation of a risk management and risk communication plan. At a
                        minimum, risk assessments should examine the potential for leakage of injected or displaced fluids via wells, faults, fractures, and
                        seismic events, and the fluids’ potential impacts on the integrity of the confining zone and endangerment to human health and the
                        environment682.
  37. Protecting        Although CO2 is an asphyxiant at high concentrations and can harm human health and the environment, it is benign at lower
      workers´ safety   concentration and is regularly handled as part of many different industrial activities. 683 As such, there are standards already established
                        for CO2 exposure and handling. Occupational hazards can be can be minimized when workers adhere to safety standards and use

      knowledge and         of the USDOE. NETL focuses on the energy portfolio, including CCS. Information is shared through its corporate site
      experience            (www.netl.doe.gov) as well as a collaboration and data-sharing site it maintains at: http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page.685
      through the
      demonstration         The US and Canada recently formalised knowledge-sharing arrangements as summarised in the United States-Canada Clean Energy
      phase                 Dialogue. This includes the Carbon Capture and Storage Clean Energy Technology Working Group, collaborating on areas such as a
                            storage atlas, next-generation technology, injection and storage-testing and public outreach strategies. Knowledge sharing is also
                            provided through the USDOE’s Clean Coal Technology and Clean Coal Power Initiative 686.

      implications           legislation, pollution laws and policies could be adapted to regulate the capture of CO 2 687.

                                 Under the Greenhouse Geological Sequestration Act 2008 (GGGS Act) carbon dioxide, whether in a gaseous or liquid state, or a
                                 mixture of a carbon dioxide, whether in a gaseous or liquid state, are considered greenhouse gas substance688.
  2.     Property rights         Under Australia’s federal system of government, the Australian (national) Government has jurisdiction extending from three
                                 nautical miles offshore to the edge of Australia’s continental shelf (Commonwealth waters), while the State and Territory
                                 Governments have jurisdiction onshore and in relation to coastal waters. CCS legislation has developed along these lines - the
                                 Australian Government being the key player given that the majority of highly prospective CO 2 storage sites are offshore (along
                                 with the bulk of petroleum activity). Ownership of most subsurface resources (including minerals/petroleum and use of the pore
                                 space) is vested in the crown (on behalf of the people) 689.

                                 In Victoria, the Crown owns all underground geological storage formations below the surface of any lands, to the extent that the
                                 formation is deeper than 15-24 meters below the surface of the land. The Crown is not liable to pay any compensation in respect of
                                 a loss caused by the operation of this section 690. Under the Victorian legislation, the Crown retains Crown land rights in respect of
                                 any residual underground geological formation not already dealt with in a grant, lease, license or other tenure 691.

                                 If an injection and monitoring licence is cancelled or surrendered, the Crown becomes the owner of any greenhouse gas substance
                                 that has been injected into an underground geological formation under that licence 692.
  3.     Competition with        The Australian CCS legal framework was designed to prevent competition between CCS projects and petroleum industries because
         other users and         of the economic importance of this sector. The Australian Government’s Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act
         preferential rights     2006 provides for petroleum and CO2 storage operations to coexist, though there are constraints. In particular, the Responsible
         issues                  Commonwealth Minister (RCM) - the decision-maker under this Act - must be satisfied that CO2 injection will not have a
                                 “significant risk of a significant adverse impact” on pre -existing petroleum titles or operations (the SROSAI test)693.

                                 The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act also provides other methods which may resolve resource conflict issues.
                                 Where petroleum and GHG projects are proposed in the same area, the Act provides for commercial agreements between

                              petroleum and GHG proponents. It is only in the absence of any such commercial agreements, that the RCM will have to decide
                              whether an activity under one title would pose a significant risk of a significant adverse impact on operations that could be carried
                              on under the other title694.

                              Section 494 of the OPGGS Act states a co-existence of greenhouse gas titles and petroleum titles. Where such titles may or do
                              overlap, the Act requires analysis of the risk and potential impacts of greenhouse gas operations on petroleum operations, as a basis
                              for determining whether the greenhouse gas operations should be allowed to proceed 695.
  4.   Composition of the     The term “CCS stream” is used in the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources (MCMPR) Regu latory Guiding
       CO2 stream             Principles and is defined as follows696:
                                     A gas or liquid/fluid, consisting predominately of carbon dioxide, which is to be injected into a geological
                                     formation for the purpose of avoiding the release of that carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Such a stream may
                                     contain other substances depending on both the source from which the carbon dioxide is being drawn as well as
                                     the capture, separation, injection and monitoring processes used.


                              The GGGS Act requires CO2 streams for injection to be either pure or consist “overwhelmingly” of CO2 697. CO2 streams may,
                              however, also contain incidental related substances and detection agents, provided that, where the CO 2 stream contains a prescribed
                              detection agent, the concentration of that agent does not exceed prescribed levels. The GGGS Act also applies to greenhouse gases
                              other than CO2 that may be considered for injection and storage.

                              The OPGGS Act contains an identical definition. The OPGGS Act defines greenhouse gas substance as other than CO 2 that may be

                                Federally, the OPGGS Act requires that details of applications for pipeline licences be published 701. Also, the VP Act states that a
                                pipeline licence applicant must provide notice of its application to owners and occupiers of lands to which the application
                                relates702.

                                Environmental engagement mechanism
                                The GGGS Act provides for community consultation on the environmental impacts of the injection testing plans 703; the injection
                                and monitoring plan704; in case of unit development if part of underground geological storage formation interstate705; and in case of

                                In Australia, enjoyment of property rights will often be subject to the provisions of Federal and State native title legislation. Native
                                title refers to rights held by indigenous Australians over their traditional lands and waters. Australian law provides protections to
                                native title holders and claimants where a government proposes to take certain actions (for example, the grant of a license or
                                approval) which may affect native title. These protections are provided by the Australian Government's Native Title Act 1993
                                (NTA) and similar State and Territory legislation and typically require that certain procedural steps such as notification and

                                 Victoria the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (VAH Act) prescribes, in regulations, the circumstances in which a Cultural Heritage
                                 Management Plan will be required708.
  6.   Scope of framework        When discussing potential users and conflicts, it must be noted (as in all locations) that this will be highly site-specific. Offshore
       and prohibitions          conflicts in Australia could include issues with other users, such as fisheries, shipping routes, infrastructure etc., but the greatest
                                 potential conflict is with the petroleum industry itself, who is concerned about compromising production709. Onshore conflicts may
                                 arise from similar users as offshore, but one must consider additional uses such as agriculture. The subsurface issues raise the most
                                 concern. Groundwater impacts (an important community-wide issue) are a huge potential conflict, as are the usage conflicts with
                                 coal bead methane (CBM) operations – there is a strong coincidence between the CBM resource and potential CO 2 storage sites710.

                                 The Australian government have adapted a range of onshore and offshore specific policy and regulatory responses to address
                                 storage management. Offshore CO2 storage is primarily governed by provisions of the government’s OPGGS Act and its
                                 associated regulations. This Act provides for clear security of title for CO 2 operators and also clarifies long term liability issues.
                                 The government has also developed detailed guidelines to help CO 2 titleholders and there are clear legislative distinctions between
                                 the petroleum industry requirements and those for other users711.

                                 The Victorian GGGS Act reflects many of the principles of the State's Petroleum Act 1988, but also makes clear that existing
                                 petroleum (and other) interests - which could include other CO2 storage operators as well as other subsurface users - should not be
                                 adversely affected. Where CO2 injection plans “… present a significant risk of contaminating or sterilising other resources in the
                                 permit area”, operators must take “… all reasonable steps” to obtain the consent of any resource authority holders whose res ource
                                 may be affected (Part 4 of the GGGS Act). While the GGGS Act allows for compensation agreements to be reached between the
                                 competing users, these are not obligatory. The Victorian Minister for Energy and Recourses may still approve a storage operation
                                 even where it may sterilise or contaminate other resources, provided that it is considered to be “… in the public interest” ( and there

  7.   Definition of ´CCS        The Australian Government released a Discussion Paper on November 2010 to propose a way forward to implement its policy
       ready´                    commitment to introduce CCS ready (CCSR) on all new coal-fired generation, and also to address the introduction of an Emissions
                                 Performance Standard (EPS). However, before the stakeholders´ consultation, the Australian Government decided not to proceed
                                 with the introduction of an emissions standard or CCSR requirements for new coal-fired power stations in preference for the
                                 introduction of a carbon price. This decision was announced by the Australian Minister for Resources and Energy on 13 December
                                 2011 as part of the launch of Australia’s Dr aft Energy White Paper. The state of Victoria has announced that it is adopting the

       mitigation strategies     law, with effect from 1 July 2014. The reason for abolishing the carbon tax was lower costs for Australian businesses.

                                 The following legislation to abolish the carbon tax was passed by the Senate and received the Royal Assent:

                                     • Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Act 2013 2014
                                     • Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Act 2014
                                     • Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Act 2014

                                Safeguard Mechanism
                                The Safeguard Mechanism requires a "responsible emitter" of a designated large facility to prevent the net emissions from their
                                facility from exceeding the baseline emissions levels during a monitoring period (a financial year). "Responsible emitter" is a new
                                term and means the person who has operational control of the facility on or after the Safeguard Commencement Day (Responsible
                                Emitter). The "operational control test" is a pre-existing test under the NGERS Act and persons who currently have National
                                Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGERS) reporting obligations are likely to be the Responsible Emitters for the
                                purposes of the Safeguard Mechanism.718

                                The safeguard mechanism will commence on 1 July 2016, to provide time for further consultation with business on key policy
                                elements such as the treatment of new investments and flexible compliance arrangements 719. According to the Consultation Paper,
                                the Safeguard Mechanism is expected to capture around 140 businesses, with approximately 57 percent of covered emissions
                                expected to come from the electricity sector 720.

                                A VEPA licence is required for all scheduled premises, unless the premises are exempted in the Environment Protection
                                (Scheduled Premises and Exemptions) Regulations 2007. Licences contain standard conditions that aim to control the operation of
                                the premises so that there is no adverse effect on the environment. These conditions address areas such as waste acceptance and
                                treatment, air and water discharges, and noise and odour. The Environment Protection Act 1970 (VEP Act) specifies penalties for
                                breach of licence conditions and for operating a site without a licence. VEPA licences and approvals are public documents 723.
  10. Monitoring,               Monitoring licence compliance
      reporting and             A monitoring program must be developed by each licence holder to ensure them, and VEPA, can determine licence compliance.
      verification (MMV)        To do this, a licence holder should use a risk-based approach to determine the level of monitoring required.
      requirements              Licence holders should be familiar with how their site interacts with the environment and community, and be in a good position to
                                develop an adequate monitoring program. 724 These monitoring plans are auditable documents that a licence holder must retain on
                                the licensed premises for seven years.
                                Licence holders must lodge an annual performance statement (APS) with VEPA each year. The licence holder must indicate
                                whether it has complied or not with each licence condition. Information supporting the APS must be held at the premises for seven
                                years, and severe penalties are provided in the Act for providing a false or misleading APS. APSs are public documents725.
  11. Inspection                VEPA authorized officers check compliance against each sites’ licence and gather specific data to support the development of
                                VEPA’s Licensed Operator Risk Assessment (LORA) model.

                                Since launching in July 2012 every licensed site has been inspected to collect up-to-date information and validate the risk ratings
                                that have been assigned to individual sites. In addition to planned licence compliance inspections (informed by LORA), VEPA also
                                inspects licensed sites as part of726:

                               data. Officers will also focus on management practices and validating licence holders’ annual performance statement (APS)
                               submissions. These inspections may be unannounced727.

                               VEPA Authorised Officers will address minor risks and non-compliances by asking the operator to remedy it in their presence, or
                               if the risk is more significant they will issue a remedial notice. VEPA will also enforce against sites that do not have suitable
                               controls or have failed to remedy any outstanding compliance issue that has been identified in the APS 728.

      infrastructure           Pipeline Management Plan
      (pipeline regulations,   A Pipeline Management Plan is required for the construction and operation of all pipelines conveying petroleum in Commonwealth
      etc.)                    and State waters. This is administered by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority for Commonwealth waters.
                               Submission requirements
                               The EP must be submitted as early as possible, but at least 30 days before commencement of activities, to allow sufficient time for
                               regulators to assess and resubmission of inadequate documents.
                               Other statutory requirements
                                    o Consent to construct. The written consent of the Minister is required before commencement of pipeline operation.
                                    o Consent to operate. The written consent of the Minister is required before commencement of pipeline operation
                                    o Summary EP's. The operator must submit a summary EP for public disclosure within ten days of acceptance of the EP in
                                        accordance with Regulation 11 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Management of Environment) Regulations 1999.
                                    o Notification of incidents. All incidents must be notified to the Department in accordance with the relevant Regulations.

                               There are the onshore pipelines activities:
                               Consultation Plan (CP)
                               An approved CP is required prior to a proponent giving notice to each land owner and occupier of intention to enter land or of a
                               pipeline corridor.
                               Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP)
                               A CEMP is required prior to construction of all pipelines. The Pipeline Regulations 2007 sets out the matters to be included in a
                               CEMP.
                               Construction Safety Management Plan (CSMP)
                               A CSMP is required prior to construction of any pipeline. This is administered by Energy Safety Victoria (ESV). The requirement
                               for an Operational Environmental Management Plan and Operational Safety Management Plan is also administered by ESV.

                               All statutory documents must be submitted as early as possible, but at least 30 days before commencement of activities, to allow
                               sufficient time for regulators to assess and resubmission of inadequate documents.

                                   o Planning permit exemption. Section 85 of the Victorian Pipelines Act 2005 states a licence issued under this Act negates
                                        the requirement to obtain a planning permit under public interest.
                                   o Rehabilitation bond. A rehabilitation bond, in the form of a bank guarantee and in an amount determined by the
                                        Department is required.
                                   o Notification of incidents. All incidents must be notified to the Department in accordance with the relevant Regulations.
                                   o Consent to operate. The written consent of the Minister is required before commencement of pipeline operation.
                                   o OEMP. Operational Environment Management Plan is required prior to the consent to operate. This is assessed by ESV.
                                   o OSMP. Operational Safety Management Plan is required prior to the consent to operate. This is assessed by ESV.
  13. Third-party access to    Victoria Pipelines Act 2005 (VP Act)
      transportation           VP Act licensee may enter into an agreement (named agreement to share use of pipeline) with any person for or in relation to the
      infrastructure           conveying by the licensee by means of the pipeline of anything belonging to that person that is authorised to be conveyed through
                               the pipeline730. This agreement must be in writing and be accompanied by the prescribed fee 731.

                               If a licensee fails to enter into an agreement under, the person seeking that agreement may apply to the Minister for directing the
                               licensee to convey by means of the pipeline the whole or a specific part of the thing sought to be conveyed 732. The matters that the
                               Minister may consider under may include: (a) the capacity of the pipeline; (b) the impact of the proposal on the safety of the
                               pipeline; and (c) any additional costs to the licensee of the proposal 733.

                               Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGS Act)
                               The OPGGS Act only provides for holders of existing greenhouse gas assessment permits or holding leases to apply for
                               greenhouse injection licences in respect of identified greenhouse gas formation within the relevant title areas 734. These parties
                               therefore effectively have preference in applying for greenhouse gas injection licences within their respective title areas.
  14. Transboundary            There is not legal disposition regarding transboundary movement of CO 2. Australian Regulatory Guiding Principles recognise that
      movement of CO2          CCS projects should follow the principles of customary international law, such as the duty not to cause transboundary

      terminology                    Greenhouse gas sequestration infrastructure: facility means a facility that is used to enable the injection of a greenhouse
      applicable to CO2                  gas substance into an underground geological storage formation
      storage                        underground geological storage formation includes:
                                              - any seal or reservoir of an underground geological formation; and
                                              - any associated geological attributes or features of an underground geological formation
  16. Third-party access to    The GGGS Act provides for third parties and existing injection and monitoring licence holders to enter into agreements for the
      storage site             injection and storage of CO2 in a storage site in the existing licence area, provided the agreement conforms with the licence and the
                               Act more broadly737.

                               If the parties cannot reach such an agreement the third party can apply to the Minister for a binding direction for the third party to
                               inject and store CO2 in the relevant storage formation, provided various conditions are satisfied 738.

                               The existing licence holder will, however, be entitled to compensation in respect of such third party access 739.

                               Also, the OPGGS Act provides that regulations made under the Act may establish a regime for third parties to use 740:
                                    identified greenhouse gas storage formations;
                                    wells, equipment or structures for injection of greenhouse gas substances; and
                                    equipment or structures for processing, compressing or storing greenhouse gas substances prior to injection.

                               All greenhouse gas injection licences are subject to the condition that, if such regulations are made, the licensee will comply with
                               them. This condition does not, however, need to be specified in the licence 741.

                               Potential injection sites are limited to places that are 743:
                                    suitable for making a well or wells for greenhouse gas injection into a geological formation; and
                                    wholly within the offshore area.

                               If a party holding a greenhouse gas assessment permit, holding lease or injection licence, or a petroleum production licence,
                               believes that part of a geological formation covered by the title is an eligible greenhouse storage formation for the purposes
                               offshore storage formations, the party must first apply to the Minister for a declaration that the formation is an identified
                               greenhouse gas formation for the purposes of the Act, before applying for a greenhouse gas holding lease or injection licence for
                               the formation744.

                               If the applicable eligibility and spatial requirements are met, the Minister must declare the formation an identified greenhouse gas
                               formation745. This declaration may, however, be varied or revoked by the Minister under certain circumstances under Section 320
                               of the GGGS Act.

                               On the other hand, the GGGS Act stablishes the greenhouse gas sequestration exploration permits that confers the flowing
                               rights746:
                                     An exploration permit authorises the holder of the permit, subject to and in accordance with the conditions of the permit:
                                               - to carry out greenhouse gas sequestration exploration in the permit area; and
                                               - to do anything in that area that is necessary for, or incidental to, that purpose.
                                     If the holder of an exploration permit discovers an underground geological storage formation in the permit area that is
                                          likely to be geologically suitable for the permanent storage of a greenhouse gas substance, the holder has the right to
                                          apply for the grant of:
                                               - an injection and monitoring licence; or
                                               - a greenhouse gas sequestration formation retention lease.

  18. Regulating site              The GGGS Act requires exploration permit holders to undertake a work program for site characterisation designed to:
      selection and                     establish the characteristics and extent of any underground storage formations in the permit area;
      characterisation                  assess the feasibility of injecting CO2 (or another greenhouse gas substance) into any identified storage formations; and
      activities                        assess the suitability of any identified storage formations for permanent storage, in a manner that protects public health
                                         and the environment and will not compromise the integrity of the storage formation.
                                        The Minister is turn required to not grant an injection and monitoring licence unless satisfied that, among other things, the
                                         relevant storage formation is suitable for CO2 injection and storage, as per the criteria outlined above.
  19. Authorization of             Greenhouse gas sequestration formation retention leases and greenhouse gas substance injection and monitoring licence
      storage activities           under GGS Act
                                   The GGGS Act provides for the holders of exploration permits and retention leases authorities to apply for injection and
                                   monitoring licences in respect of geologically suitable and commercially viable storage formations 748. For areas not covered by
                                   such instruments or by an expired or cancelled injection and monitoring licence, the Minister can invite applications for licences749.

                                   Once issued, an injection and monitoring licence will entitle the licence holder to 750:

                                       continue to explore for storage formations in the licence area; and
                                       do anything else within the licence area that is necessary for or incidental to those purposes.

                                   The Minister’s decision whether to grant or refuse an injection and monitoring licence must be based on the factors and crite ria
                                   specified in the GGGS Act751. Once issued, an injection and monitoring licence continues in force until it is cancelled or
                                   surrendered, or the GGGS Act otherwise provides752. Finally, before commencing injection a licence holder must submit an in
                                   injection and monitoring plan753 and an operations plan754, each of which must be approved by the Minister.

                                   The holder of a greenhouse gas assessment permit, greenhouse gas holding lease or petroleum production licence may only apply
                                   for a greenhouse gas injection licence in respect of a formation following a declaration755 that the formation is an identified
                                   greenhouse gas storage formation.

                               The applicant may be offered the licence if the Minister is satisfied that, among other things 756:
                                    the applicant will, within five years of receiving the licence, commence commercial injection and permanent storage of
                                       CO2 or another greenhouse gas within the area to be licenced;
                                    any significant risk that the injection and storage activities will have a significant impact on petroleum activities has been
                                       addressed in accordance with the terms of the Act; and

                               Once issued, a greenhouse gas injection licence replaces the greenhouse gas assessment permit or holding lease which previously
                               applied in respect of the relevant storage formation(s) 757. OPGGS Act specifies the rights conferred under greenhouse gas injection
                               licences, which include (subject to licence conditions) the right to 758:
                                     inject and permanently store CO2 or another a greenhouse gas into an identified greenhouse gas storage formation (as
                                         defined in section 318*) within the licence area;
                                     explore in the licence area for potential CO2 storage formations and injection sites;
                                     inject and store CO2 in a potential storage formation, on an appraisal basis,
                                     inject and store air, petroleum and water in a potential storage formation, for the purposes of exploration;
                                     subject to obtaining the Minister’s consent, recover petroleum in the licence area in order to appraise a petroleum
                                         discovery incidental to the exploration (although any petroleum recovered will not become the property of the permit
                                         holder).

                               Greenhouse gas injection licences are in each case subject to the following conditions 759:
                                    only greenhouse gases specifically authorised in the licence may be injected and stored;
                                    injection may only be undertaken using wells located within the licence area and specified in the licence; and
                                    formations for injection and storage must be wholly within the licence area, and specified in the licence.

                               Greenhouse gas injection licences will be subject to further conditions, for example in relation to financial security. Subject to
                               cancellation or surrender760, greenhouse gas injection licences remain valid indefinitely.

                               The Minister may consent to the surrender if the licence holder has761:

  20. International laws for         Australia is a party to the following international conventions and regional agreements that refer to marine debris 762.
      the protection of the
      marine environment.            London Convention
                                     Australia is party of the London Convention (Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
                                     Matter 1972) that is an agreement to control pollution of the sea by dumping and to encourage regional agreements supplementary
                                     to the Convention.

                                     The convention does not explicitly mention CO2, and there has been some discussion if CO2 falls within the definition of “waste”.
                                     The London Convention currently prohibits any disposal of “industrial waste” into the sea. This means that if CO 2 are regarded as
                                     “industrial waste”, it is absolutely prohibited to dump CO 2 (e.g. by storing it beneath seabed). There is still no consensus between
                                     the parties whether CO2 is covered by this definition.

                                     In 1996 the London Protocol was agreed with the purpose of modernising and updating the original Convention. Under this
                                     protocol all dumping of “waste” is prohibited, except from acceptable “wastes” included in a “reverse-list”. An amendment to the
                                     London Protocol was accepted in 2006, with the purpose of including CO 2 to the “reverse-list”. With this amendment CO2 streams
                                     from CO2 capture processes for storage may be considered for storage below sea-bed.

                                     Further Article 6 of the London Protocol prohibits the “export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or
                                     incineration at sea”. The parties have interpreted the article as a prohibition to export of CO 2 form a contracting party for injection
                                     into sub-seabed geological formations. To solve this problem of transboundary movement of CO 2, the contracting parties made an
                                     amendment to Article 6. This provision makes it possible to transport CO 2 from a contracting party. However, in accordance with
                                     Article 21, two-thirds of the contracting parties must accept the amendment before it can enter into force. However, Australia has
                                     not ratified the amendment.

                                     MARPOL
                                     The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL), (as amended by the Protocol of 1978)
                                     is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or
                                     accidental causes. The MARPOL convention is a primary agreement for regulating pollution from ships, both accidental pollution

                            shipping between jurisdictions could potentially apply to the definition of “harmful substance”. F urther regulations for prevention
                            of pollution by harmful substance carried by sea in packaged form are set in Annex III. These regulations contain detailed
                            standards on packing, marking, labelling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations, exceptions and notifications. In relation to
                            transboundary CCS activities, some of these regulations might be subject to shipping of CO 2 in gas cylinders or in liquefied form.

                            Australia is party of the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Part XII – Protection and preservation of
                            the marine environment. UNCLOS does not explicit mention CO 2, and there has been some discussion as to whether CO 2 falls
                            within the definition of “waste”.
  21. Project inspections   GGGS Act inspections
                            The GGGS Act enables the Minister to authorize inspectors, who can in turn carry out inspections for the purposes of determining
                            compliance with the Act763. Inspectors are given a wide range of powers, including the power to 764:
                                1. enter any premises believed to be used for a CO2 sequestration operation;
                                2. inspect the premises and anything on the premises;
                                3. copy documents;
                                4. seize items where necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction;
                                5. test equipment;
                                6. take photographs and audio and visual recordings; and
                                7. use assistants in exercising the above powers.

                            Inspectors must, however, exercise these powers only to the extent necessary to determine compliance with the Act, or avoid
                            immediate risk to property or the environment.

                            Inspectors can also exercise the above powers:
                                 1. if there is a risk to any member of the public, property or the environment 765; or
                                 2. to search for evidence of offences under the Act, without a search warrant if the occupier of the premises consents to the
                                     search, or otherwise with a search warrant766.

                             The Minister has the power to appoint greenhouse gas inspectors with the following powers 767:
                                 1. access any part of the offshore area or any structure, vessel, aircraft or building in an offshore area, the use of which is
                                    believed to be connected to exploration, pre-injection processing, injection, storage or transport in offshore CO2

                                 2. inspect and test any equipment the use of which is believed to be connected to any of those operations; and
                                 3. enter any structure, vessel, aircraft, building or place believed to contain documents relating to any of those operations.
                                 4. Inspectors can only exercise the above powers to enter residential premises if the occupier has voluntarily consented to
                                     such entry768, or otherwise in accordance with a warrant issued 769.

      requirements
                             Before commencing injection of CO2 or other greenhouse gases, the holder of an injection and monitoring and licence must submit
                             to the Minister an injection and monitoring plan prepared, which sets out, among other things771:
                                   a description of the proposed monitoring techniques;
                                   a monitoring and verification plan detailing how the behavior of any stored greenhouse gas substance will be monitored;
                                      and
                                   an estimate of the cost of the monitoring and verification activities to be undertaken after the greenhouse gas injection and
                                      monitoring has been surrendered.

                             Reporting activities
                             Each holder of an injection and monitoring licence must report the outcomes of all monitoring and verification performed under the
                             licence to the Minister772. Reports are then to be made publicly available through the greenhouse gas sequestration register.

                             Licence holders are required to pay an annual amount towards their estimated long-term monitoring and verification costs, as set
                             out in the approved injection and monitoring plan. The amount is to be determined as a percentage fixed by the Minister of the total
                             estimated cost of long-term monitoring and verification773.

                               The OPGGS Act empowers the Minister to monitor the behavior of greenhouse gases stored in a part of a geological formation in
                               the offshore area and, where regulations made report this information publicly 774.

                               The Minister has the power to direct greenhouse gas title holders to 775:
                                    1.      keep specified accounts, records and other documents;
                                    2.      collect and retain specified cores, cuttings and samples; and
                               submit specified reports, returns, other documents, cores, cuttings and samples, in connection with greenhouse gas operations.
                               Failure to comply with such a direction is subject to penalty.
                               Regulations addressing such data and information may also be made of the Act 776, and in particular may require title holders to
                               prepare and submit a data management plan.

                               Finally, applications for site closing certificates must include, among other things, the applicant’s suggested approach for the
                               Commonwealth in monitoring the stored greenhouse gas after issuance of the site closure certificate 777.
  23. Corrective measures      Definition of serious situation
      and remediation          A “serious situation” is defined in the GGGS Act to include events such as leakage of stored CO 2, behaviour of CO2 other than as
      measures                 anticipated, and compromise of the storage site as a result of CO2 injection778.

                               In the event of a serious situation, the GGGS Act requires that:
                                     the operator reports the serious situation within the period of time specified in the regulations 779; and
                                     the Minister may direct the operator to inject or otherwise store the CO 2 in a particular manner, stop or suspend injection,
                                        inject CO2 at a specified location, or take any other action, in order to remedy the situation 780.

                               Failure by an operator to comply with such a direction constitutes an offence 781.

                               On the other hand, OPGGS Act define a “serious situation” to include cases where there is782:

                                        a leakage or a significant risk of leakage of CO2 from storage formations or in the course of injection;
                                        a behaviour or significant risk of behaviour of CO2 other than as predicted;
                                        a significant adverse impact on the geotechnical integrity of the storage formation or structure, or significant risk of such
                                         impact as a result of CO2 injection; or
                                        unsuitability of the identified greenhouse gas storage formation (with or without engineering enhancements) for the
                                         relevant storage activities.

                               Where a serious situation occurs, the OPGGS Act empowers the Minister to direct the licence holder to 783:
                                   undertake injection or storage operations within the relevant storage formation in a specified manner;
                                   cease or suspend injection at a particular site or into a particular storage formation;
                                   inject a greenhouse gas into the relevant storage formation at a particular site;
                                   undertake specified activities to eliminate, mitigate, manage or remediate the serious situation; or
                                   take or not take any other specified action.

                               Actions specified in a direction may be required to be taken within the licence area or in an offshore area outside the licence area.
                               If, however, the location in which an action is to be taken overlaps with the area covered by a licence, lease or permit held by
                               another party, the Minister must consult with that other party before giving the direction, unless the serious situation is an
                               emergency, in which case this consultation requirement does not apply784.

                               Remedial directions
                               The OPGGS Act empowers the Minister to give written directions to holders of greenhouse gas assessment permits and holding
                               leases, and holders of greenhouse gas injection licences who have not yet commenced injection, requiring them to 785:
                                     remove all property from the title area;
                                     plug or close off all wells in the title area;
                                     provide for the conservation and protection of natural resources in the title area; andmake good any damage to the seabed
                                         or subsoil in the title area.
  24. Liability during the     Operational liabilities under GGGS Act
      project period           The GGGS Act imposes a number of operational requirements that must be observed during CO 2 sequestration activities. These
                               include (among other things):
                                    1.     Before commencing operations, the operator must submit to the Minister an operation plan identifying the risks the

                                             operations present to the public, the environment and any surrounding property, and how those risks are to be
                                             mitigated.786
                                     2.      The operator must ensure that the operation is carried out in accordance with the operation plan, as approved by the
                                             Minister. 787
                                     3.
                                             Operators must ensure that CO2 sequestration operations are carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner. 788
                                     4.      Operators must also prevent any waste or escape of CO2 or water, prevent damage to CO2 storage formations outside
                                             the licence area, and keep separate any injected CO2 and water sources in the storage complex. 789
                                     5.      Operators must maintain in good condition and repair all structures, equipment and other property used in connection
                                             with CO2 sequestration operations, and remove all structures, equipment and other property that are not being used in
                                             connection with the those operations.790
                                     6.      Operators must rehabilitate any land that is used in carrying out any operation and must, as far as is practicable,
                                             complete such rehabilitation before the relevant licence ceases to apply to the land. 791
                                     7.      Operators must hold insurance against expenses or liabilities from the undertaking of operations. 792
                                Failure to comply with any of the above requirements is subject to penalty.

                                Greenhouse gas title holders liability
                                OPGGS Act requires greenhouse gas title holders undertaking exploration or injection operations to, among other things 793:
                                    1. undertake such operations in a proper and workmanlike manner;
                                    2. control the flow and prevent the escape of greenhouse gases;
                                    3. control the flow and prevent the waste or escape of petroleum or water; and
                                    4. prevent damage to petroleum-bearing strata, and potential greenhouse gas storage formations.

                                Title holders are further required794:
                                     1. maintain in good condition and repair all structures, equipment and other property used to undertake operations in the

                                     2. remove from the title area all structures, equipment and other property that is neither used nor to be used in connection
                                        with such operations.
  25. Liability during the      Australian Government can assume long term liability for CO 2 injected into a formation fifteen years after injection operations have
      post-closure period       ceased, where a "closure assurance period" in respect of the formation has elapsed 795.

                                In contrast, Victoria does not have an equivalent provision for the transfer of responsibilities to the Victorian Government. Under
                                the OPGGS Act, all liabilities remain with the operator. This is consistent with the approach to liability under the onshore
                                regulatory framework in Victoria pursuant to the GGGS Act 796.

                                The OPGGS Act explicitly confirms that the Crown owns all underground geological storage formations below the surface of the
                                submerged land in the coastal waters. It provides that "the Crown is not liable to pay any compensation in respect of a loss caused
                                by the operation of this section" 797. The Crown also becomes the owner of any GHG substance injected in the underground
                                formation following cancellation or surrender of a GHG injection licence. The operator will still be at risk of potential liability
                                claims, but it is not clear whether the Crown assumes any liability resulting from its ownership of the CO 2 streams.
  26. Financial                 The GGGS Act requires each holder of an injection and monitoring licence to pay an annual amount towards the estimated long-
      contributions to          term monitoring and verification costs for the storage site, as set out in the approved injection and monitoring plan 798. The amount
      post-closure              is to be determined as a percentage, fixed by the Minister, of the total estimated cost of long-term monitoring and verification for
      stewardship               the site.

                                Where an injection and monitoring licence is to be surrendered, before such surrender the licence holder must pay the remaining
                                long-term monitoring and verification costs not already paid 799. Any excess payment must, however, be refunded to the operator.

                                Although the OPGGS Act does not require holders of greenhouse gas injection licences to make direct financial contributions to
                                long term stewardship during the licence period, it does provide that:
                                     a site closing certificate will only be issued once the operator has provided security to cover the Commonwealth’s
                                         estimated costs in monitoring the long term behavior of stored greenhouse gases 800; and

                                 The Minister may also issue regulations that authorise petroleum licensees to explore for potential greenhouse gas storage
                                 formations or greenhouse gas injection sites within the relevant licence area. 803

                                 The OPGGS Act accommodates, where appropriate, CO2 transport and injection for EOR purposes, for example in relation to

      Strategic                  landscape scale assessments and unlike project-by-project assessments, which look at individual actions (such as construction and
      environmental              operation of a pipeline or wind farm), they can consider a much broader set of actions. For example, a large urban growth area that

  30. Environmental             At the Federal level, the EPBC Act provides an integrated environmental assessment and approval process for developments of
      impact assessment         "national environmental significance." Any such approval would involve an environmental impact assessment. This is not
                                explicitly dealt with in the Australian Government's GGS Act but could apply to permitted activities under that Act. It is also
                                important to note that it has previously been proposed that a "greenhouse trigger" be integrated into the EPBC regime. If enacted,
                                this would add greenhouse gas emissions to the list of matters of national environmental significance matters806.

                                In Victoria, the Environmental Effects Act 1978 (VEE Act) governs the preparation of environmental impact assessments, or
                                "Environmental Effects Statements" (EES) as defined under that Act. Under the Act, the Minister for Planning has discretion to
                                determine whether an EES is required in respect of, relevantly, public works, any Ministerial decision or action, or any decision by
                                a person or body under Victorian law. If the Planning Minister determines that an EES is required, the responsibility for preparing
                                it lies with the project proponent. Once an EES is prepared, it is publicly displayed and no work can proceed on the development
                                until the Minister has assessed the EES. Even where an EES is not required, an EIS may still be required under the VEE Act807.
  31. Pollution prevention      The GGGS Act makes provision in relation to that matter by, or under, the Dangerous Goods Act 1985, the Environment Protection
      requirements (air,        Act 1970, the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 or the Water Act 1989, the provision made by GGGS Act 808:
      water)                    (a) if not inconsistent with that other provision, must be observed in addition to that other provision; and(b) if inconsistent with that
                                other provision, is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect and that other provision prevails.
  32. Nature legislation        Victoria has important areas with marine mammal populations where these gather, breed and feed. Marine mammals are given
      requirements              special protection under law in these areas to minimize disturbance and allow them the necessary space.
      (consideration of
      protected habitats
      and species)
  33. Waste legislation         In Victoria, premises capturing, separating, processing or storing waste carbon dioxide are regulated under the Environment
      requirements              Protection (Scheduled Premises and Exemptions) Regulations 2007. Although the term “ waste carbon dioxide” is not defined, the
                                Environment Protection Act 1970 (Vic) only defines “waste” to include any matter whether solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactiv e
                                which is discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to cause an alteration in

                                On this basis, carbon dioxide injected as part of a CCS project is already classified as a waste under existing Victorian legislation.
                                The effect of this is that a CCS proponent will need to comply with relevant Victorian environmental law in undertaking CCS
                                operations, including the State Environment Protection Policy, which expressly prohibits the direct discharge of wastes into any
                                Victorian geological structure or formation containing or capable of containing water, where “beneficial uses” are impacted

  34. Coastal and marine        The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 implemented the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of
      protection                Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972 (London Protocol) into Australian law, prohibiting dumping of
      requirements              controlled materials into the sea. The London Protocol, which was amended in 2006 to make clear that CO2 could be stored in the
                                sea bed. It was again amended in 2009 to address a problematic issue regarding the transboundary transport of CO 2 prior to
                                injection, as the London Protocol prohibited the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at
                                sea. An amendment exempting the transboundary transport of CO 2 for the purpose of injection has however not yet been ratified by
                                the necessary majority of Parties to the Protocol.

                                Transportation by ship811
                                Federal and Victorian have integrated CCS legislation seeks to regulate transportation of CO 2 by ship.
  35. Coverage by GHG           The Australian Government developed a national carbon offset standard, due to be introduced in Australia in 2010. The purpose of
      trading schemes           the standard would have been to regulate emission reductions occurring outside the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) by
                                ensuring minimum standards and establishing verification and validation protocols 812.

                                However, the legislation for the CPRS failed to gain adequate support and was twice rejected, creating a double dissolution election
                                trigger. In April 2010, CPRS was deferred. A successor to the CPRS, the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) was passed into law as
                                part of the Clean Energy Futures Package (CEF) in 2011, but was repealed in July 2014 following a change in government.
  36. Protecting human          There are no specific requirements about protecting human health and CCS projects. However, Australia has general civil
      health                    protection requirements which could apply to any emergencies related to CCS projects with a view to protect human health.
                                Moreover, provisions of the regulatory framework for CCS activities, such as on site characterization aim at contributing to the
                                protection of human health through the necessary risk assessments, monitoring or the adoption of remediation measures.

  37. Protecting workers´          There are no specific requirements in Australia for protecting workers´ safety in CCS projects. Victoria has an Occupational
      safety                       Health and Safety Act 2004 containing general occupational health and safety requirements.
  38. Sharing knowledge            The Australian Government Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has detailed knowledge-sharing arrangements for
      and experience               projects as part of the initial funding for the pre-feasibility studies. The Global CCS Institute knowledge-sharing framework has
      through the                  been used as the basis for this work, although not all of the possible knowledge categories were used. To date, supported projects
      demonstration phase          have agreed to contribute to project factsheets, knowledge-sharing reports as well as providing knowledge-sharing personnel. The
                                   projects are receptive to knowledge sharing, but within the boundaries of protection of specified intellectual property813.

                                   The Victorian Government has contributed over A$29million (US$2.5) to the Centre for Energy and Greenhouse Gas Technologies
                                   (CEGT) (Victorian DPI, 2009a). CEGT identifies new technologies that require investment to reach the demonstration or
                                   commercialization stage. The Centre, in conjunction with co-investors, aims to generate venture capital grade returns on its
                                   investments by meeting the growing Australian and global demand for these technologies. 814

General
 1. Classification  of   Ensuring a clear definition/classification of CO2 and of the type of          Trinidad and Tobago did not have any laws specifically classifying CO2
     CO2 and its legal   activities constituting CCS operations is the first step to effective         but the Environmental Management Act 2000 contained definitions for
     implications        regulation. It affects the structure of regulatory frameworks and             ‘air pollutant’, ‘hazardous substance’, ‘pollutant’, ‘waste’ and ‘water
                         regulatory oversight.                                                         pollutant’ which all could potentially apply to CO2. (see definitions p.15)
                         Classification options include:                                               The definitions are broad enough in scope that if CO2 were to be injected
                         - Hazardous: could become hazardous depending on certain                      into the subsurface for a CCS project, it could be determined by the EMA
                              criteria, e.g. presence of certain impurities, pressure, concentration   as a waste and accordingly be subject to permitting requirements under
                              or volumes of storage and handling.                                      applicable laws and regulations.
                         - Waste: CO2 could be waste depending on its properties and
                              injecting CO2 into geological formations could constitute a waste
                              disposal activity. Existing waste frameworks might not be fit for
                              purpose when applied for CO2 (transfers of waste between
                              operators rather than continuous flow of material).
                         - Pollutant/nuisance: on the basis of the effects that CO2 emissions
                              into the atmosphere could have on climate, it could be classified as
                              a pollutant when emitted (atmospheric protection laws).
                         - Commodity: CO2 could be treated as a commodity for use in
                              enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (HER) or in other industrial
                              processes. Important to identify responsibility for regulation.

                         Create a chain of custody for CO2 from source to storage,
                         allocating responsibilities and liabilities to regulators and operators.

                         administrative burdens.
  2.   Property rights   Recognise existing property interests and explain how property rights         The CCS Regulatory Test Toolkit for Scotland notes the concern that
                         associated with stored CO2 are to be allocated and managed, bearing in        might arise on the part of developers around proprietary data. Power

                         Issues that could be relevant include:                                        possible local opposition.

                               and in certain locations or situations. Application of hazardous
                               waste regulations and requirements could also be triggered by the
                               presence of certain substances. Groundwater protection legislation
                               might restrict the types of materials allowed to be injected into the

                               key element of regulatory considerations in the context of
                               impurities has been to prohibit operators from using CCS as a
                               means to dispose other hazardous wastes, by adding the waste to
                               the CO2 stream for injection (Annex 1 London Protocol - Carbon

                           -   Potential impacts of impurities: a practical approach to
                               regulating CO2 purity levels is to start from the perspective of the
                               potential risks that impurities pose to CO2 infrastructure, human
                               health and the environment in the event of release, or of potential
                               effects on storage media. In practice, each project should be
                               assessed on a case-by-case basis.

                           Key points that could be included:
                           - Imposing requirements for operators to monitor and report on the
                               composition of CO2 streams transferred from capture to
                               transportation, received at injection locations and ultimately
                               injected for geological storage.
                           - Imposing CO2 acceptance criteria for operators within permit
                               authorisations
                           - Recognising any obligations required due to obligations under
                               international treaties as well as requirements these obligations may
                               set on the allowable composition of CO2 streams for storage
                           - Amending existing laws in order to allow CCS activities to take
                               place, e.g. introducing modifications to existing groundwater
                               protection laws in order to allow CO2 comprising other incidental
                               substances to be injected for the purpose of long-term storage.

7.   Definition of ´CCS   New plants should be built in such a way to enable CCS to be               There is no specific definition of CCS ready in any of the regulations here

                          “locked-in” and unable to be addressed by CCS when the necessary
                          regulatory and economic drivers are put in place. This precaution is
                          known as CCS ready (CCSR). While regulating CCSR may be
                          important, it must be remembered that CCSR is not itself a CO 2
                          mitigation option, but rather a way to facilitate CO2 mitigation in the
                          future. CCSR ceases to be relevant in jurisdictions where the necessary
                          drivers are already in place or once they come into place.

                          A globally accepted definition for CCSR is difficult to achieve , with
                          CCSR likely to differ between jurisdictions, as different jurisdictions
                          will respond to region- and site-specific issues. CCSR regulation will
                          also have to be flexible enough to take account of the rapidly changing
                          technology, policy and regulatory context to CCS and CCSR.

     mitigation strategies
                             In most cases incentives are applied at the point of capture rather than
                             across the whole chain of CCS activities. A custody chain for the CO 2
                             is necessary to underpin the scheme’s environmental integrity and a
                             regulatory framework, provides the operator of the incentive scheme
                             with appropriate assurances in respect of the permanence of emission
                             reductions achieved. Some discussion has taken place regarding the
                             provision of incentives for storage activities by issuing storage site
                             operators with tradable credits per tonne of CO2 stored or other forms
                             of incentive payments but challenge lies in linking the amount of CO 2
                             stored to the amount of CO2 “avoided”.

                             Types of incentive frameworks that might be considered to promote
                             CCS deployment at large CO2 emitting point source installations:
                             - Carbon taxes imposed for each tonne of CO2 that is emitted into
                                the atmosphere: when CCS prevents emission, tax is no longer
                                imposed (Norway)
                             - Cap-and-trade based emission trading: emitters are given an
                                allowance of emission rights and/or are required to purchase

                                surrender emission rights equal to the amount of CO 2 emitted over
                                a given period (typically one year). If CO2 captured and securely
                                stored is considered as “not-emitted,” CCS projects are absolved
                                of the requirement to surrender emission rights for captured and
                                stored CO2 (Kyoto Protocol and EU ETS).

                          -   Emissions performance standards: operators are required to reduce
                              emissions – or a portfolio of emissions – below an agreed level per
                              unit output (California and Washington).

                          Avoid double regulation (e.g. double monitoring and reporting
                          obligations) when developing parallel regulatory and incentive

    infrastructure          authorities have an interest in optimizing the use of that capacity.

                            If operators try to prevent potential new connectors from entering the
                            market, without any reasonable technical or economic grounds, the
                            relevant authority may consider implementing laws that set conditions
                            by which operators are obliged to grant third-party access to CO2
                            pipelines and storage sites. The ultimate aim of such measures would
                            be to provide incentives for more operators to use CCS in order to
                            deliver deep emission cuts. Regulation must be developed carefully to
                            ensure that unintended disincentives for the design, finance and

                      Factors to be carefully considered when developing such regulatory
                      measures:
                      - The need for rapid CCS deployment for achieving large-scale
                          reductions in CO2 emissions.
                      - The high entry cost for new market participants which creates
                          significant barriers.
                      - The need to bring in smaller players that could reduce their entry
                          costs through accessing existing infrastructure.
                      - The need to provide incentives for first movers to ensure that
                          infrastructure is built.
                      - Technical limitations such as reduced pipeline capacity which is
                          not designed to match the CO2 output of capture facilities;
                          blending different sources of CO2 in pipelines; lack of capacity. In
                          addition, maximum injection rates (injectivity) and the possible
                          effects of differential pressure fields in storage sites could restrict
                          the further expansion of capacity on existing projects.

                      It is advised to consult with industry experts to gain their views on how
                      to make effective regulation of this type.

                      Prior to implementing forced third-party access, parties should be
                      encouraged to find a suitable resolution to allow access for the third
                      party, e.g. "open season" subscription periods, agreement of a rate for
                      access as a means of compensation (compensation payments to the
                      operator should be agreed prior to injection of the CO 2).

                      Necessary to establish appropriate dispute resolution processes to
                      deal with any potential access refusals by operators and/or claims by
                      potential new market entrants.
14. Transboundary     Potential transboundary scenarios that could raise issues during              The CCS Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago includes the
    movement of CO2   capture, transportation and storage:                                          Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of

                          -   Use of storage complexes that span jurisdictional borders.             sharing of maritime border with Venezuela (several shared oil and gas
                          -   Secondary effects from storage activities occurring across             reservoirs) as a precedent of concluding a bilateral agreement outlining the
                              jurisdictional borders (e.g. due to a sub-surface pressure front or    terms and conditions for producing the resource, which would be relevant
                              displacement of sub-surface fluids across borders).                    in instances where a potential storage location includes a maritime
                                                                                                     boundary.
                          Need for transboundary regulatory co-operation to create harmonised
                          regulatory approaches as regards applications and authorisations;          The Regulations applicable to the right to move gas, petroleum,
                          reviews; monitoring requirements; inspections; closure requirements;       petroleum products or petrochemicals by pipeline beyond the area of a
                          post-closure requirements; and the handling of long-term responsibility    production in Trinidad and Tobago may inform the development of any
                          for the storage site and any associated liabilities.                       CO2 pipeline regulatory activity.

                          Need for co-ordination of regulatory oversight for authorisations,

                          Consider harmonization of fiscal and market regulations for CCS
                          operations, including network facilitation/optimization (e.g. joint
                          bidding rounds for storage space exploration, joint auctioning of

                          if, e.g., responsibility allocation differs between areas, establish
                          principles on emissions monitoring and reporting, consider potential
                          application of international legal instruments which could be triggered
                          by transboundary movements of CO2, e.g. 1989 Basel Convention,
                          1991 Bamako Convention, London Convention and Protocol.
CO2 storage and usage
 15. Definitions    and   In drafting a regulatory framework for CO2 storage operations, it may      No specific information relating to definitions and terminology was
      terminology         be beneficial to identify the intended scope of the framework,             identified in the toolkits.
      applicable to CO2   including the framework’s regulated activities and the activities that
      storage             fall outside the scope of the framework. This avoids any ambiguity
                          over the scope of the framework and avoids confusion with other forms
                          of CO2 storage activities, such as bio-sequestration or ocean storage.


                                                                                                                                                                    323
                           Ocean storage is banned under international legal instruments such as
                           the London Convention; therefore, for contracting parties to the
                           London Convention it is useful to include this ban within a CO 2
                           storage regulatory framework.

                           It may be useful to establish a minimum CO2 storage volume in a
                           regulatory framework in order to simplify the approval process for
                           research and development scale projects (EU CCS Directive).

                           In the context of a CCS regulatory framework definitions will
                           generally be required to:
                           - describe the scope and meaning of certain technical terms;
                           - clarify the meaning of certain events, activities or processes;
                           - implement certain standards, conventions or agreed requirements
                               as set out in international legal instruments.
                           Definitions should provide clarity to enable effective enforcement,
                           while also being flexible enough to enable the regulatory framework to
                           cover a range of possible CO2 sources and geological settings.
                           Challenge in balancing the appropriate level of detail in the definitions
                           developed (body of definitions currently used is dynamic). Definitions
                           may be subject to future changes as best practice for regulatory and
                           greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting frameworks for CCS continues to
                           evolve through greater dialogue and practical implementation.

                           Model text for definitions is included on pages 58 and 59.

                           Two common, non-technical features, also consistent with oil and gas:       - The systems already in place for exploration of the subsurface could
                           - need to limit the duration of the exploration authorisation to ensure         potentially relate to exploration for storage purposes.

The authorisation process prior to undertaking development activities
provides the principal mechanism by which appropriate regulatory
oversight of CO2 storage site development and operation can be
achieved, as regulators evaluate the technical details of the site and the
operator’s competence (technical, legal and financial merits). Focus
should be on gaining assurances over the short, medium and long term
regarding the security and safety of a proposed CO2 storage operation.

Consultation on the storage site authorisation application should also
be carried out with relevant parties to allow for a wider set of views to

be brought into the decision-making process.

If the relevant authority does not feel sufficiently assured of the short,
medium and long-term security of the storage site or the economic
viability of the operations, the applicant should be given the
opportunity to provide additional information and analysis or the
authorisation application should be rejected.

For commercial reasons, the storage authorisation application process
should also:
- Be open and transparent so as to allow a commercial market for
    CO2 storage to develop.
- Give preference to the holder of the relevant exploration
    authorisation, because of the investment made by this entity.
- Ensure that no other authorisations have been issued for the same
    area or for other types of activities that could conflict with the
    storage objectives.

Provision of revised authorisation applications to allow flexibility in
cases where an operator wishes to extend the life of the storage
operation (e.g.through connection of new sources).

The issued authorisation should cover specific terms (more or less
covering the requirements of the application, e.g. storage site
delineation, modes of operation, CO2 composition, initial monitoring
plan, reporting and notifications, corrective measures and remediation,
closure, post-closure and transfer of responsibility [if applicable],
financial security.

The competent authority should have the power to withdraw the
authorisation for unsatisfactory operations, as determined by
regular reporting and inspections. If the operator is able to demonstrate
that the concerns of the relevant authority have been addressed, an
authorisation may be reissued under revised conditions. If this is not
possible, the storage site should be closed.

Requirements may also be laid down for storage site closure (i.e.
following the decommissioning of a storage site), depending on the

                            approach that the relevant jurisdiction has to long-term stewardship.
                            When a CCS regulatory framework provides for the transfer of
                            responsibility to the relevant authority, a storage site closure
                            authorisation is likely to be issued at the time when the relevant
                            authority takes on responsibility for the site and be contingent on
                            the operator having satisfied the relevant authority that the storage site
                            has been appropriately decommissioned and that there is no significant
                            risk of future leakage or other irregularity in the storage site. The
                            relevant authority may insist that a specified period of time elapse
                            between cessation of injection and issue of a site closure authorisation.
                            Examples within the context of the Model that include a transfer of
                            responsibility generally require both evidence of storage site security
                            and a minimum time period to have elapsed prior to storage site
                            closure. (see also section 24 below on liability)

More likely to be necessary in the early stages of a project than later in
the project life cycle. Inspection frequency is also likely to be higher if
there has been any significant leakage, unintended migration or other
irregularity at a storage site.

Relevant authorities may be potentially supported by third-party
verifiers. Frequency, timing and appropriate party to undertake
periodic reviews (e.g. which authority and/or the use of third-party
verifiers) will depend on common practice in a particular region.
General requirements:
- Inspection objectives: (not limited to, but at least) direct site
     visits to examine surface facilities, verification of records
     concerning CO2 mass received, CO2 mass injected, any routine
     shut-down activities, any unplanned shutdowns or unintended
     incidents and review of monitoring results.
- Inspection frequency: variable according to particular practice in
     the region and depending on the site performance history. Good
     practice would suggest combinations of (i) annual reporting and
     review by the relevant authority (ii) at least annual or biannual
     routine inspections of operations (iii) at least annual third-party
     verification, with oversight from the relevant authority, (iv) non-
     routine inspections to investigate any reports of leakage,
     unintended migration or other significant irregularity, complaints
     or other situations as necessary.

injected CO2 plume.
• Effective provision of information about: pressure and volume
behaviour; the areal and vertical distribution of the CO2 plume;

                        pressure-driven processes causing leakage is decreasing and predicted
                        behaviour is converging with the observed behaviour (implying a high
                        level of understanding of the sub-surface), a strong case may be made
                        to scale-back monitoring efforts. If there is a high level of confidence
                        that these conditions are being met, it may be possible to completely
                        end any passive and scheduled monitoring activities. Monitoring may

Global effects: Incentive schemes for CCS are likely to create
performance-based payments linked to the amount of CO2 avoided
through a project. In the event of leakage, payments should be adjusted
accordingly. This can occur through different mechanisms, e.g. cap-
and-trade based emissions trading schemes, project based emissions
trading schemes etc. In most cases, these types of schemes will be
based on supra-regional or international mechanisms, rules and
enforcement, and as such be imposed through other forms of
regulation. Therefore, it not always necessary to directly include these
obligations in any regulatory texts under development, although
acknowledgment of the linkages should be made within the preamble
or guidance notes. An overall compatibility check with requirements
imposed under these types of schemes will form part of the detailed
review to be undertaken when developing a CCS regulatory
framework.

CCS regulatory frameworks should include obligations for operators
to make good any detected leakage or unintended migration, when
possible. If the operator is unable to make the necessary interventions,
the relevant authority should be able to intervene on behalf of the
operator and remediate leaks, with a cost recoverable from the
operator. (Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009 [QLD] Queensland,
Australia)

Requirements on operators to hold insurance or other forms of
financial security should be clearly articulated in any regulatory texts.

CCS regulatory frameworks should impose a variety of obligations on
storage site operators after injection ceases, i.e. within the closure
period. Closure requirements should include the technical conditions
for closure and requirements for an approved closure plan
(decommissioning and removal of surface equipment, well-
abandonment procedures, ongoing monitoring activities during the
closure period)

                           Responsibility for the site may be transferred to the relevant
                           authority with the storage site closure authorisation (see also above
                           section 19 on authorisation).
                           Where transfer of responsibility is not envisaged, storage site
                           closure is likely to mark the point where the operator has satisfied the
                           relevant authority that it is appropriate for the operator’s active post -
                           injection obligations in relation to the storage site (for example,
                           monitoring) to cease. In this situation, the operator will retain
                           “passive” obligations in relation to the storage site, i.e. the operator
                           will remain wholly responsible for any corrective or remediation
                           measures that may be required post-closure and for any liabilities

                           Where operators are state-owned, clear separation of ownership may
                           not be apparent and the issue of transferring responsibility may not
                           arise.
                           Arguments both in favour and against transferring liability (pp.100-
                           101)

                           Following a transfer of responsibility, the relevant authority may
                           undertake periodic monitoring in order to gain continued assurances
                           regarding the security of CO2 storage. Additional monitoring may also
                           be initiated if an event occurs that could have an effect on CO2 storage.
                           A transfer of responsibility may have financial implications for
                           relevant authorities, so a regulatory framework envisaging transfer of
                           responsibility shall appropriately manage the resulting risks for the

                          relevant authority. The most effective way to manage these risks is to
                          ensure that good practice is required across the life cycle of CCS
                          projects in structuring regulatory approaches, and that these practices
                          are effectively enforced.

                          Following a transfer of responsibility, the relevant authority may be
                          responsible for any liability arising as a result of leakage or
                          unintended migration (local effects).
                          Matters relating to the global effects of leakage over the longer term,
                          if linked to emission reduction commitments and emission trading
                          schemes, might create problems for the long-term integrity of any
                          incentives scheme that awards payments for not-emitting that are later
                          reversed. There are several approaches for managing liability in the
                          event of such occurrences (see p.105).

                          relevant authority by requiring the operator to contribute to the costs
                          associated with long-term stewardship of the site. This contribution can

                          contribution to post-closure stewardship, the relevant authority does
                          not have to carry the financial burden for the long-term liability, unless
                          any financial liability incurred exceeds the contribution received.

                          Ongoing discussions regarding structuring these types of mechanisms
                          are considering, amongst others, trust fund, escrow liability fund or
                          storage bonds, fees, combined approaches/mix of options.

                          residues (e.g. biofuel production). This is because the CO 2 emissions
                          from the combustion of biogenic matter is taken out of the short-term
                          terrestrial biological carbon pool and is therefore accounted for at the


                                                                                                                                                                338
                        time of removal (as net changes in the terrestrial biomass carbon
                        stocks). Consequently, it does not need to be added to the atmospheric
                        stock calculations, as this would lead to the CO2 emissions being
                        counted twice. It is, however, generally reported for informational
                        purposes.

                        When looking at any biomass projects, accurate accounting should be
                        made of any agricultural or biomass-growing practices that can lead to
                        some land use change emissions and these should be factored into the
                        project’s total life cycle emissions. It is also important to understand
                        the sustainability of any biomass used.

                        Where CO2 of biogenic origin is captured and stored, it can result in
                        negative emission reductions (i.e. zero, less the amount of CO 2
                        captured and stored). Under proposed 2006 IPCC GLs rules, such
                        negative reductions can be used to offset national GHG inventories.
                        Other monitoring and reporting standards, e.g. EU ETS, do not allow
                        for negative emissions of this type to be reported in this manner
                        (further policy-development is needed to define ideas or provide
                        incentives for this type of contribution to emission reductions).

                        Where biogenic CO2 is removed from fermentation offgas streams (e.g.
                        in biofuel refineries), incentives could be provided at the point of
                        production (appropriate emissions accounting, emissions “crediting”,
                        or other forms of fiscal measures). Incentives could also be provided
                        at the point of use, through policies and mechanisms such as fiscal
                        measures for different fuel duties or through biofuel obligations scaled
                        according to the climate benefits delivered. This issue needs careful
                        consideration to ensure a coherent policy that recognises the benefits of
                        such technologies, while avoiding “double -counting” the emissions
                        reductions achieved.
28. Enhanced            Enhanced Hydrocarbon Recovery (EHR), CCS and joint EHR/CCS                  The CCS Regulatory Review for Trinidad and Tobago notes that although
    hydrocarbon         projects differ in their aims and operations.                               CCS was not listed as a Designated Activity within the Certificate of
    recovery with CCS                                                                               Environmental Clearance, it would be likely that CCS activity in its
                        EHR: CO2 is injected for the sole purpose of enhancing hydrocarbon          entirety would be major enough to require a CEC under the Certificate of
                        recovery. The project is optimised to maximise hydrocarbon                  Environmental Clearance (Designated Activities) Order 2001. Some of

                        incidental to the aim of the project. Monitoring is used during the         CCS projects dealing with enhanced secondary oil recovery activities.


                                                                                                                                                                339

                            the purpose of hydrocarbon recovery.

                            Joint EHR/CCS: CO2 is injected for the dual purpose of enhancing
                            hydrocarbon recovery and preventing CO2 from reaching the
                            atmosphere. The project balances these two objectives with the
                            possibility of optimising either objective. Monitoring will be used to
                            fulfil the monitoring requirements of both EHR and CCS. Weyburn in
                            Canada is an example of a joint EHR/CCS project.

                            Projects may also commence as an EHR or joint EHR/CCS project and
                            change into a pure CCS project after hydrocarbon recovery has ceased.

                            Although CCS, joint EHR/CCS and EHR projects are all likely to
                            result in significant quantities of CO2 being geologically stored, EHR
                            projects differ from the other two types of projects in a number of
                            important ways. Most importantly, in EHR projects, monitoring the
                            CO2 plume for unintended migration and leakage is not routinely
                            undertaken (other than where this has implications for oil recovery),
                            which means verification of CO2 stored is not possible, therefore, a
                            project cannot be considered a CCS project.

                          From a regulatory perspective, EHR operations will be governed by
                          prevailing rules on pipeline construction and operation, oilfield
                          management and decommissioning procedures. Given the different
                          approaches and objectives of EHR as compared to CCS, CCS
                          regulatory standards for long-term storage and for monitoring and
                          verifying injections should apply when: hydrocarbon recovery
                          operations at a site come to a close and the operator wishes to convert
                          the site to a pure CO2 storage operation; and for joint EHR/CCS
                          projects.

                        Finance Corporation, World Bank Group).

                        EIA should identify and provide options for minimizing local and
                        regional environmental impacts related to the capture, transportation
                        and storage of CO2, e.g. impacts associated with air emissions, use of
                        water and solid waste generation.
                        In addition to the technical requirements for an EIA, it may also be
                        used to promote public participation in a project, e.g. civil society may
                        make recommendations on an EIA and identify ways to mitigate any
                        environmental impact.

                        It is likely that the major surface components of a CCS project (CO2
                        source, capture installation, transport installation, wells and any surface
                        facilities at injection sites) are already covered by existing EIA laws or
                        through international and corporate standards. Similarly, any surveying
                        activities such as seismic acquisition are also likely to be covered by
                        appropriate arrangements.

new issues as regards EIA practice. The EIA process for a CCS project
should enable an understanding of the potential risks that CCS
operations could pose to the surrounding environment, building off the
site characterisation work.

The EIA for CCS operations should draw on good practice examples
(e.g. the London Protocol “Risk Assessment and Management
Framework for CO₂ Sequestration in sub-Seabed Geological
Structures” [RAMF] document and the OSPAR FRAM document) and
include:
- A risk based approach based on scenario modelling undertaken
     as part of site characterisation. It should assess the levels of
     uncertainty associated with predictions and include assessments
     according to worst-case scenarios.
- Consequence analysis which should enable an understanding of
     the impact that CO2 leakage or unintended migration could have
     on potential receptors, including acute and chronic impacts at the
     different magnitudes, including the hydrosphere (e.g. possible
     communication and contamination affecting water extraction for
     potable supply, agricultural or industrial uses), the biosphere (e.g.
     possible flora and fauna that could be affected) and the atmosphere
     (such as the release of any toxic substances).
          If such sensitivities are identified, further analysis which
          should include (i) an exposure assessment based on the
          potential fate and behaviour of leaking CO 2 and the
          characteristics of the surrounding domains (incl. other users;
          distribution of flora and fauna) and any human populations
          near the storage site and (ii) an effects assessment based on
          the sensitivity of particular species, communities or habitats
          linked to potential leakages (locations and flux rates)
          identified. When relevant, an effective assessment should
          include the effects of exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations
          in the biosphere (including soils, marine sediments and
          benthic waters [asphyxiation and hypercapnia] and reduced
          pH in those environments as a consequence of seeping CO 2).
          It should also include an assessment of the effects of other
          substances that may be present in leaking CO2 streams (either
          impurities present in the injection stream, mobilised through



                                                                             342
                                    injection or new substances formed during CO2 storage).
                                    These effects should be considered at a range of temporal and
                                    spatial scales and linked to a range of events of different
                                    magnitude.
                                    The type of analysis should support the implementation of
                                    various obligations that may be imposed by international law
                                    (e.g. RAMF, FRAM) and any EIA procedure introduced
                                    should take into account these requirements.

                           The EIA process is also useful for collecting baseline data used to
                           calibrate certain monitoring results, such as:
                           - Sub-surface: geochemical and geophysical data (regarding brine
                                aquifers, wells, gravity, seismic, topography/relief) and other
                                similar data can support analysis of CO2 plume migration and
                                monitoring of features in the storage complex.
                           - Surface and near-surface: data relevant to e.g. soil gas, potable
                                aquifers can support warning signs for seepage, support seepage
                                quantification and provide a baseline for any remediation
                                measures.
                           - Surrounding domains: The sensitivity of ecosystems should be
                                established during the storage site risk assessment.

                           Best practices are still being developed. The IEA Greenhouse Gas
                           R&D Programme (GHG IA) has produced a report on EIA

phase   Key components of a demonstration framework include:
        • Technical potential for CCS deployment in a country: based on the
        major emission sources and their suitability for carbon dioxide (CO2)
        capture.
        • Storage capacity potential: based on a high-level review of national
        storage capacity potential – using         international best practice
        methodologies to enable comparison of estimates. The Carbon
        Sequestration Leadership Forum has a standardised method, Carbon
        Sequestration Leadership Forum Task Force on CO2 Storage Capacity
        Estimation (2007), Estimation of CO2 Storage Capacity in Geological
        Media (Phase II Final Report), CSLF, Washington, DC, available at:
        www.cslforum.org .
        • Technologies: covering which technologies are most promising and
        which ones are suited to the circumstances of the country in question.
        • Regulatory needs: as described throughout this Model Framework.
        • Providing incentives and financing CCS: assessing potential
        mechanisms to support CCS and the sources of finance that could be
        leveraged to fund CCS demonstration projects.
        • Public engagement: in terms of building public understanding and
        confidence in CCS, including why the technology is needed and how it
        works.
        • Timeframes: describing the key milestones in rolling out national
        CCS demonstration strategies, linked to the items listed in the previous
        bullets.

        While CCS is predominantly in a demonstration phase, it is useful to
        pool experiences in order to facilitate the dissemination of lessons
        learnt (dissemination of good practice). Several forums are emerging
        that are designed to share good practice examples including the IEA,
        the IEA International CCS Regulatory Network, the IEA Greenhouse
        Gas R&D Programme, The Global Carbon Capture and Storage
        Institute (GCCSI), the European Technology Platform for Zero
        Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP).
        Emerging technology transfer processes and technology mechanisms
        under discussion at an international level through the United Nations
        Framework Convention on Climate Change should also be actively
        monitored as a means to leverage support for national level actions
        linked to CCS.
