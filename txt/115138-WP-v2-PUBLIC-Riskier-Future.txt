Executive
Summary


 Key messages from this report:

■■   Most disaster risk assessment today is static, focusing only on
     understanding current risks. A paradigm shift is needed toward
     dynamic risk assessments, which reveal the drivers of risk and
     the effectiveness of policies focused on reducing risk.

■■   Global disaster risk is changing extremely fast, due to
     combined dynamics of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

■■   The drivers of disaster risk are in the control of policy makers,
     society, and individuals—but accurate assessment and
     continuous reevaluation of risk are required to enable effective
     risk reduction and prevent drastic increases in future losses.

           There is variability in annual losses and deaths from disasters, but annual
         total damage (averaged over a 10-year period) has increased tenfold between

                                       ollowing the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
                                       2015–2030, the disaster risk management (DRM) sector seeks to build on
                                       progress made under the Hyogo Framework for Action and to tackle the
                                  continued increase in annual disaster losses over the last decades. The goal
                                  of the framework is to

                                       prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of
                                       integrated and inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health, cultural,
                                       educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional
                                       measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability
                                       to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus
                                       strengthen resilience (United Nations 2015, 6, emphasis added).
     Adaptation and risk          It is well known that disaster risk is subject to change in its underlying
     management policies and      components: the hazard (the potentially dangerous naturally occurring
                                  event, such as an earthquake or tropical cyclone), exposure (the population
     practices will be more       and economic assets located in hazard-prone areas), and vulnerability (the
     successful if they take      susceptibility of the exposed elements to the natural hazard) (IPCC 2012).
                                  In an environment of rapid urbanization, population growth, unplanned
     the dynamic nature of
                                  development, unsafe building practices, and changing climate, investment in
     vulnerability and exposure   and design of disaster risk management activities must account for changes
     into account.                in the nature of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. As the Intergovernmental
                                  Panel on Climate Change asserts, “adaptation and risk management policies
                                  and practices will be more successful if they take the dynamic nature of
                                  vulnerability and exposure into account” (IPCC 2012, 67).

                                      exposure, and vulnerability. Hazard refers to the likelihood and
                                      intensity of a potentially destructive natural phenomenon, such as
                               ground shaking induced by an earthquake or extreme winds associated with
                               a cyclone. Exposure refers to the location, attributes, and value of people
                               and assets (such as buildings, agricultural land, and infrastructure) that
                               are exposed to the hazard. Vulnerability is the potential extent to which
                               physical, social, economic, and environmental assets may become damaged
                               or disrupted when exposed to a hazard event. Vulnerability includes physical
                               vulnerability, which refers to the level of damage sustained by built structures
                               due to the physical load imparted by a hazard event. It also includes social
                               vulnerability (also termed “socioeconomic vulnerability” or “socioeconomic

                                         he evolution of hazard is felt through changes in the geographic
                                         distribution of potentially damaging events, as well as changes in the
                                         frequency and intensity of these events. The cause of these changes is
                                   hazard-dependent. Human activity influences hydrometeorological hazards
                                   by altering conditions in the oceanic and atmospheric systems, primarily
                                   through emission of greenhouse gases. The changes in these systems manifest
                                   as changes in global temperature, rainfall patterns, and mean sea level, which
                                   influence wind, flood, drought, heat, and wildfire hazards. The evolution of
                                   hazard also involves interactions between hazards. Changing rainfall patterns,
                                   for example, influence soil stability, whicj in turn influences landslide hazard
                                   and have a further impact on flood hazard.

     Box 3.2         Effects of Co-seismic Subsidence in Recent Earthquake Events
  In Christchurch, New Zealand, faulting and liquefaction from the 2011 earthquake caused subsidence of up to 1 m. Built on
  a floodplain, the city was at risk of flooding from tidal events and heavy precipitation even before the earthquake, and the
  Christchurch City Council had sought to account for projected sea-level rise by requiring new houses to be built with floor
  levels 3 m above sea level. As a result of the earthquake, however, flood risk from the Avon River has significantly increased,
  specifically because of subsidence, lateral spreading and heaving of the riverbed (which reduced river channel volume), and
  settling of riverbanks and levees. To mitigate the new level of risk, the city has had to dredge channels, construct emergency
  levees, and build a new storm water network (Giovinazzi et al. 2011), and there have been additional efforts to mitigate flooding
  of individual homes (Christchurch City Council 2014). While reconstruction of properties focuses on repairing earthquake
  damage, homes in the floodplain must be reconstructed with consideration for increased flood risk—that is, must be rebuilt with
  higher floor levels.

  In subduction zone earthquakes, the area of co-seismic subsidence can be large, and primarily affects the near-shore or onshore
  side of the fault because of the fault structure and rupture mechanism. The Research Center for Prediction of Earthquakes and
  Volcanic Eruptions, at Tohoku University, found that subsidence due to the Great East Japan Earthquake lowered the ground
  level at the Oshiki Peninsula, close to the cities of Onagawa and Ishinomaki, by up to 5.3 m. As a result, the harbor areas of
  these cities now flood daily at high tide.

     Box 3.3        Effects of Subsidence in Jakarta, Indonesia
  In rapidly urbanizing Jakarta, Indonesia, groundwater extraction has led to an estimated 2 m of subsidence between 1999 and
  2013, with an additional 1.8 m expected between 2013 and 2025 (Deltares 2014).

  The greatest subsidence is occurring in north Jakarta, where the rivers and canals that flow through the city discharge into
  Jakarta Bay. In conjunction with rising sea level and the occurrence of extreme weather events, subsidence is contributing to
  the increasing urban and tidal flood hazard. At current rates of subsidence and sea-level rise, and without coastal protection,
  residential and industrial areas of north Jakarta, major transport links (including the international airport), and ports could be
  submerged within 100 years (World Bank 2011b). Coastal protection in the form of the Jakarta Coastal Defence Strategy (a dike
  and polder system), along with land reclamation and improved pumping capacity, are proposed to tackle the problem. But the
  long-term solution lies in replacing groundwater extraction with piped water supply, thus reducing the rate of subsidence.

Analyses of the evolution of drought
risk in the past and the future have
been conducted at varying scales.
On a global scale, the estimated
share of the world population
facing water scarcity increased
from 20 percent in 1960 to 50
percent in 2000 (Veldkamp et al.
2015). In the short term (6 to 10
years), hydroclimatic variability is
responsible for almost 80 percent
of the yearly change in water
scarcity, whereas socioeconomic
development is the driving force           Due to its tropical region, different physical effects of climate change—increased temperature and precipitation,
behind long-term changes. The IPCC         increased salinity and extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones and drought—are felt in Sundarban, India.

                                        he rise in disaster losses over the past decades is due mainly to
                                        changes in socioeconomic factors, specifically population and wealth
                                        (for regional and global trends see figure 4.1 and figure 4.2). There is
                                  evidence of this for several hazards and regions, including hurricanes in the
                                  United States, and river floods and extratropical cyclones in Europe (e.g.,
                                  Barredo 2009, 2010; Bouwer et al. 2007; Mohleji and Pielke 2014; Visser,
                                  Petersen, and Ligtvoet 2014). The effect of exposure on increasing disaster
                                  losses has been established with much more confidence than the effect of
                                  hazard and vulnerability, in part because of the relatively short time series of
                                  losses and the lack of well-developed methodologies for quantifying hazard
                                  and vulnerability (Visser, Petersen, and Ligtvoet 2014). The IPCC (2012, 9)

                                          ost disaster risk assessment tools developed to date focus on the
                                          static assessment of current risk. Thus most risk assessments do not

                                 these assessments may not be optimal. Over time, disaster risk assessment
                                 has improved and grown more sophisticated (GFDRR 2014a), but due to the

                                 for managing risk (particularly in the financial sector), efforts to model the
                                 evolution of risk have only recently been undertaken. A recent review of 80
                                 open source and open access risk assessment tools (GFDRR 2014b) found
                                 none that included explicit modeling of future risk. However, risk models
                                 can be augmented with data representing future conditions (e.g., higher sea
                                 level, increased population density, or changing climatic conditions; see box
     Most risk assessments       6.1 for an account of how a set of emissions scenarios—the Representative

    Box 6.1           Representative Concentration Pathways
  The Representative Concentration Pathways are a set of emissions scenarios, each of which provides a trajectory of greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions and concentrations to 2100 (figure B6.1.1). Four RCPs have been developed from the many emissions
  scenarios in the published climate literature. The four RCPs are therefore representative of a wider base of emissions
  scenarios, and they provide a simplified basis from which to model future climate and a way to account for the uncertainty
  in the future trajectory of emissions. RCPs are used to input initial conditions for ocean-atmosphere climate models and to
  develop Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which are “reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the
  evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale” (O’Neill et al. 2014, 387). The RCPs do not include the impacts of
  socioeconomic change or climate policies.

  RCPs are labeled according to radiative forcing (the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the earth-atmosphere system)
  at the year 2100, in watts per square meter (W/m2) (table B6.1.1). The higher the radiative forcing, the greater the climate
  warming; the warming occurs because there is more incoming solar energy and absorption of energy by GHGs than outgoing
  reflected energy.

  To summarize the assumptions of RCPs: Air pollution controls becomes more stringent, due to rising income levels, causing
  decline in air-polluting emissions (SO2, NOx); GHG concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O) match the emission trajectories of these GHGs.
  Thus in all RCPs, radiative forcing continues on its current trajectory until 2025. For RCP8.5, radiative forcing continues to
  increase at the same rate throughout the 21st century; for RCP2.6, decline in radiative forcing begins at 2030; and for the other
  RCPs, radiative forcing increases at a slower rate than for RCP8.5.

  RCPs provide input to general circulation models, or global climate models (GCMs), which model atmospheric, ocean, or coupled
  atmosphere-ocean processes. These models simulate fluid motion in the atmosphere and oceans on three-dimensional grids
  through time in order to simulate the changes in and interactions between various climatic parameters: flow of air and water,
  surface pressure, temperature, water vapor, and radiation. GCMs produce spatial atmosphere, ocean, and land-surface data,
  such as monthly mean or time-dependent wind speed, humidity, air pressure, sea-level change, sea ice area/thickness, ocean
  heat flux, precipitation. These parameters can be incorporated into cyclone or flood models to simulate the effects of future
  climate on these hazards.

  GCMs operate at spatial resolutions in the tens of kilometers, and are unable to resolve features of the atmosphere finer than the
  model resolution. In order to resolve smaller features, GCMs are downscaled by nesting regional climate models (RCMs) within
  GCMs (using global variables as boundary conditions) to produce regional estimates of climate and weather. Alternatively,
  statistical downscaling can be used to relate global variables to regional or local variables. These downscaled regional and
  local variables are used as inputs to physical models (e.g., hydrological models, crop response models, and drought models) to
  generate hazard-specific event catalogs under future climate conditions.

  Cyclones can occur in clusters because the large-scale atmospheric conditions suitable for their formation and propagation—
  e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other naturally cyclical conditions—can persist for periods of several weeks (not
  just for the period of one storm). As a result, there may be periods of higher activity in which losses are more substantial than
  in periods of average activity. For example, in Europe, extratropical cyclone losses were particularly severe in 1990 (four events
  each caused over US$1.9 billion in losses) and 1999 (three events each caused over US$3 billion in losses).

  Earthquake clusters occur in the short term and long term. A short-term cluster is the series of foreshocks, mainshock, and
  aftershocks that comprises an earthquake sequence. Such sequences may last many months, as occurred in the 2010–2011
  earthquake sequence in Canterbury, New Zealand. Long-term clusters are defined by the increased probability of large-
  magnitude earthquakes occurring on the same plate boundary as a result of increased stress transfer from an earlier earthquake.
  Time-dependent models of earthquake recurrence are used widely.

  River floods are often the result of large-scale weather systems, which may cause intense precipitation over large areas within
  a short time. In June 2013, for example, nine countries in Central and Eastern Europe were hit by a series of river floods causing
  over US$15 billion in damages. Jongman et al. (2014) showed that different parts of Europe are interconnected by these large-
  scale weather systems, and that failing to take into account these effects in continental-level risk assessment may strongly
  underestimate the risk.

  Box 6.3          Open Cities Mapping and Development
Timely collection and sharing of exposure data are vital for generating data that are as accurate and up-to-date as possible.
Collecting data in the same area continuously over long periods of time can help to improve the temporal resolution of exposure
data and to capture changes in the ongoing development of urban areas. The World Bank/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
and Recovery (GFDRR) Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) uses tools such as OpenStreetMap to conduct community
mapping initiatives under its Open Cities project (http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar/publication/planning-open-cities-
mapping-project). This type of community mapping makes it possible to update exposure data more frequently. Ultimately, these
data can be incorporated in disaster risk assessments and inform projections of exposure for assessing future disaster risk. Case
Study H provides insight into the benefits of an OpenDRI project in Malawi.

The Open Cities Project was launched in November 2012 to create open data ecosystems that will facilitate innovative, data-
driven urban planning and disaster risk management in South Asian cities. Open Cities represents a scalable approach to
developing open, accurate, up-to-date spatial data on the characteristics and location of built and natural environments.

                                                                                                                                  continues

    Box 6.3         Continues
  Since its start, Open Cities has brought together stakeholders from government, donor agencies, the private sector, universities,
  and civil society groups to create usable information through community mapping techniques, to build applications and tools
  that inform decision making, and to develop the networks of trust and social capital necessary for these efforts to become
  sustainable.

  The Open Cities Project launched its efforts in three cities: Batticaloa, Sri Lanka; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Kathmandu, Nepal.
  In these cities, the project has led to development of comprehensive and accessible databases of the built environment. For
  instance, Batticaloa now has a detailed structural database of every building, and Kathmandu has a database of all schools and
  hospitals that can be used for risk assessment. The Open Cities Project has improved in-country capacity to update, maintain,
  and use key data sets; it has created innovation spaces (such as the Kathmandu Living Labs), internship opportunities, and
  university curricula that provide students with employable skills; and it has mainstreamed open data use and strengthened
  data collection and management processes at different levels of government. The Sri Lanka Survey Department, for example,
  asked for support to start incorporating crowd-sourcing and community mapping approaches into its regular work flow, and the
  government of Sri Lanka has sought support for the creation of an Open and Spatial Data Infrastructure.

  Another outcome of Open Cities is the adoption of new applications by multiple levels of government and World Bank–
  financed projects, as well as development of complementary new partnerships and increased collaboration. New partners to
  implement projects include the U.S. Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the
  Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), and the American Red Cross.

    Box 6.4       Global Population Data Sets
  An increasing number of spatial data sets provide estimates of human settlement through absolute population values,
  population density, characterization of land use, and delineation of urban/rural extents, and they therefore have the potential
  to be used in disaster risk assessment. These data sets are generally derived from census data and satellite imagery, and vary in
  available resolution. They can be used as baseline data sets for projecting exposure into the future. Among the most commonly
  used global data sets are the following:

  ■■ Landscan (www.ornl.gov/landscan/) offers annually updated global population distribution at a spatial resolution of 30 arc
      seconds (c. 1 km2 at the equator), generated using census data, administrative boundaries, high-resolution land-use data,
      and topographic data to identify areas of land unsuitable for habitation or development, and aerial imagery to identify
      settlement patterns.

  ■■ The Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) (http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/grump-v1/methods) has
      generated gridded population at 30 arc seconds resolution for 1990, 1995, and 2000 using census data and satellite data.
      Urban extents have been derived from NOAA’s night-time lights data set, and this project also provides a point data set of
      all urban areas with populations of > 1,000.

  ■■ The Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) (http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/gpw-v4/) provides a 30 arc-second (1 km
      at the equator) resolution population data set, consisting of population estimates at five-year intervals between 2005 and
      2020.

  ■■ WorldPop (http://www.worldpop.org.uk/) provides freely available gridded population data at 100 m resolution for all
      low- and middle-income countries. The data are developed using high-resolution land cover, settlement, and census data
      (Linard, Gilbert, and Tatem 2011; Tatem et al. 2007). This level of detail enables the mapping of rural settlements and
      provides information on the accessibility of population centers to rural populations.

  ■■ The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Global Exposure Database (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) is an open database of
      global building stock and population distribution for earthquake vulnerability assessments. It provides multi-scale data
      (national to per-building scale) derived using multiple sources and homogenized to form a consistent data set (Dell’Acqua,
      Gamba, and Jaiswal 2012).

  ■■ The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) (http://ghslsys.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) is the first attempt to produce a high-resolution
      global data set of human settlement, through automatic image information retrieval of very high-resolution (0.5–10 m)
      remotely sensed image data input (Pesaresi et al. 2013). In places where no high-resolution imagery is available, the GHSL
      presents best estimates of human settlements using Landscan population and Modis 500 m urban extent data.

  ■■ The Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) (http://themasites.pbl.nl/models/image/index.php/Welcome_
      to_IMAGE_3.0_Documentation) provides global downscaled model output data for a wide range of environmental and
      socioeconomic indicators, including global population and GDP per capita projections. The IMAGE model includes results
      from the HYDE history database on the global environment (Klein Goldewijk et al. 2011), which contains freely available
      raster data layers on estimated population, GDP, land use, greenhouse emissions, industrial production, and several
      agricultural indicators for the period 10,000 BCE–2005 CE.

  Box 6.5              Spatial Patterns of Urban Growth in Africa
Urbanization has profound social, environmental, and epidemiological implications. Spatial and quantitative estimations of urban
change and population density are valuable information for vulnerability assessment. A model has been developed to predict the
spatial pattern of urban growth in African cities to 2020 and 2030, based on the observed growth of 20 large African cities between
1990 and 2000 (Angel et al. 2013).

The model combined a parsimonious set of generalizable factors that influence spatial patterns of urban growth: slope
angle derived from a digital elevation model; accessibility represented by travel time to the central business district along
the transport network; and neighborhood indexes such as the proportion of urbanized land within a given buffer distance
(150 m, 1 km, and 5 km). Boosted regression trees (BRTs) were developed using classification of Landsat images into urban and
nonurban pixels (30 m resolution) between 1990 and 2000 for 20 African cities as training data. The BRT model was then used to
generate predictions of the rural to urban conversion probability for every 100 m pixel in the study cities (figure B6.5.1A) and predict
their urban growth pattern (figure B6.5.2).

      Results showed that accessibility (figure B6.5.1B) and proportion of urban land within 1 km (figure B6.5.1C) were the most
      influential predictors of urban expansion. BRT models were found to have greater predictive power than a simple distance-
      based model (i.e., a model in which the rural to urban conversion probability is proportional to the distance from the nearest
      urban pixel, resulting in spatially uniform urban growth). Predictive power was low overall, however. The model predicted
      spatial growth well for small, rapidly growing cities, but it performed less well for large, slowly expanding cities—i.e., cities in
      later phases of urbanization. It is difficult to adequately capture all spatial heterogeneities of cities and temporal influences
      on development in a statistical model, and further models need to be developed to account for urban growth patterns in their
      different phases.

      The simple and generalizable model developed in this work is now being used to produce the most detailed Africa-wide urban
      expansion predictions that have yet been made, and it will provide realistic scenarios of urban growth to 2020 and 2030.
      Future work will use a version of the model presented here to simulate the urban expansion of every large African city to 2020
      and 2030 and to produce projected population distribution data sets under a range of growth scenarios following AfriPop/
      WorldPop methods (Linard et al. 2012; www.worldpop.org.uk).

                   Compared to hazard and exposure, vulnerability has, to date,
                   been quantified to a very limited extent in the context of
                   evolving risk. Global changes in vulnerability and their effects
                   on disaster risk therefore remain highly uncertain.

    Box 7.1        Land-Use Planning
  Land-use planning is the primary tool for controlling exposure to hazards. Land-use planning tools can be used to prevent
  new development in hazardous areas, relocate assets to less hazardous locations (“managed retreat”), or restrict the types
  of land use that can be permitted in hazard zones. The absence of urban planning in many areas of the world, particularly in
  developing countries, has led to uncontrolled development in hazardous areas (such as on landslide-prone hillsides) and to
  rapid development into areas of high flood hazard (such as Jakarta, Manila, and Bangkok). Where unplanned or poorly planned
  development occurs in hazardous areas, exposure and vulnerability increase significantly.

  Policies and regulations can undoubtedly be designed to limit exposure in hazard-prone areas. It is the enforcement of such
  policies that remains a big challenge. In many high-income countries it can be difficult, even with regulation effective by law, to
  prevent increasing exposure, either due to development or land-use changes, see Case Study I. In many low-income countries,
  the enforcement is even more limited, not only because governmental capabilities for enforcement are weak but because the
  areas themselves tend to be attractive in terms of jobs and services (Hallegatte et al. 2015).

  In a national-level analysis of flood risk and adaptation options in Indonesia, Muis et al. (2015) show that land-use planning
  can be a key policy tool for reducing flood risk in rapidly urbanizing countries. The authors show that if no new cities
  were constructed in Indonesia’s flood prone-areas between 2010 and 2030, annual expected losses from river and coastal
  floods would be 50–80 percent lower by the end of that time period than if cities were built. Without such limits on urban
  construction, it is estimated that flood risk may increase by as much as 166 percent (river floods) and 445 percent (coastal
  floods) over the three decades due to urbanization alone, with additional increases expected as a result of climate change and
  economic growth.

  structural characteristics (e.g., height and configuration) affect the seismic resistance of different buildings within the general
  URM category, but overall these building are less seismically resistant than other construction types. They have little capacity to
  deform once the strength of their elements has been exceeded, leading to abrupt failure.

  In 1931, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake destroyed many URM buildings in the city of Napier in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand.
  Subsequently, construction of URM buildings was discouraged and then finally prohibited by legislation. In 1935 a building
  standard was created that required buildings in New Zealand to withstand horizontal acceleration of 0.1 g, and that
  recommended reinforced concrete or steel frame for construction of public buildings (New Zealand Standards Institute 1935). In
  1965, New Zealand standards prohibited the use of URM to various extents, depending on the seismic zone: entirely in zones of
  highest seismic risk; for buildings of more than one story in zones of moderate seismic risk; and for buildings of more than two
  stories in zones of low seismic risk (New Zealand Standards Institute 1965). In 1976, a more advanced loadings code explicitly
  prohibited the use of URM throughout the whole of New Zealand (Standards Association of New Zealand 1976; Russell and
  Ingham 2010).

  While the New Zealand legislation applied to new buildings, from 1968 the government had powers to classify existing buildings
  as “earthquake prone” and require owners to reduce or remove the danger (Russell and Ingham 2010). Many earthquake-prone
  buildings were strengthened between 1968 and 2003. When the new Building Act came into force in 2004, strengthening of
  earthquake-prone buildings was required to achieve one-third or two-thirds of the new building standard.

  During the 2010–2011 earthquake sequence in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, a Mw 6.3 earthquake struck the city of
  Christchurch. The building stock in Christchurch in 2011 was primarily timber for residential buildings and reinforced concrete
  in commercial areas, with additional reinforced masonry buildings (Wilkinson et al. 2013) and a number of URM buildings.
  Thirty-nine of 185 fatalities in the February 2011 earthquake were attributed to the failure of URM construction, primarily in
  the central business district. Seismic retrofit was shown to be important in mitigating the damage: URM buildings strengthened
  to 100 percent of the new building standard performed well, those strengthened to 67 percent performed moderately well,
  and those strengthened to less than 33 percent did not perform significantly better than those that had not been strengthened.
  Ingham and Griffith (2011) showed that the risk to building occupants and public space occupants (those in the street near
  the building) was higher for buildings that received no strengthening than for those where walls, connections, or the entire
  structure had been strengthened, or elements (gables, parapets) secured. Another study showed that not all strengthening
  systems achieved the level of damage mitigation expected, partially due to the quality of the original construction material, and
  partially due to shortfalls in design and implementation of the strengthening mechanisms (Wilkinson et al. 2013).

  Based on the 130 percent increase in the population of Canterbury, New Zealand, between 1930–1940 and 2010, a projection
  of the number of potential URM buildings in Canterbury suggests that there could have been an additional 275 URM buildings
  in the region in 2010 had legislation not prohibited their construction (Figure B7.2.1). All other thing being equal (including
  other trends in construction practices and rates of seismic retrofit), it would follow that the number of casualties in the 2011
  Christchurch earthquake would also have been higher. The patterns of damage also suggest that had a smaller proportion of
  URM building been strengthened, the number of fatalities due to URM damage or collapse could have been higher. This short
  example thus demonstrates how disaster risk can be mitigated by prohibiting (or requiring retrofit and structural strengthening
  of) construction types with high seismic vulnerability.

     Box 7.3         Nonengineered Solutions to Flood Protection
  Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are a means of reducing runoff from a site, encouraging settlement and infiltration of
  water, and treating surface water before it discharges into watercourses. These systems help to mitigate flood risk, and they
  also protect water quality, particularly in urban areas where surface water can be polluted by activities on roads and other
  paved surfaces (Charlesworth, Harker, and Rickard 2003). Relying on permeable rather than impermeable surfaces and on
  vegetation-based treatment of water, SuDS make use of soakaways, retention ponds, or wetland areas. They are a form of green
  infrastructure, offering an alternative to traditional grey infrastructure such as piped drainage and conventional water treatment
  systems (Andoh 2011).

  Coastal vegetation plays an important role in flood protection. Previous studies have suggested that coastal forests, including
  mangroves, can help to reduce losses due to cyclones (Badola and Hussain 2005) and tsunami (e.g., Dahdouh-Guebas et al.
  2005). While the trees may suffer damage, the presence of tree trunks in the water increases friction and slows the flow.
  Vegetation such as dune grasses can stabilize coastal dunes, which because of their high elevation form a physical barrier to
  flow from the coast; the grasses bind the dune and mitigate erosion due to storm waves and rising sea levels. Not only can
  coastal vegetation mitigate the impact of storm and tsunami waves, it can also provide ecosystems that support residents’
  livelihoods, for example through provision of timber and fisheries, or via social amenities and tourist activities.

     Box 7.4         Social Safety Nets
  Social safety nets are “non-contributory transfers designed to provide regular and predictable support to targeted poor and
  vulnerable people” (World Bank 2014, xiii). They include cash transfers (e.g., school stipends and cash to the elderly or
  orphans) and in-kind transfers (e.g., school meals and food supplements or vouchers). Transfers may be unconditional or they
  may be conditional on attendance at health centers, school, or skills programs. Public works programs, which engage people in
  manual work such as building community assets and infrastructure, may also be part of a social safety net.

    Box 7.5        Catastrophe Insurance Schemes
  The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (Cummins and Mahul 2009) provides immediate funding to Caribbean
  governments in the event of a major hurricane or earthquake. The facility allows each participating country government to
  aggregate its risk into one portfolio. This diversifies the risks, and transfers some of the risk to the international reinsurance
  market, which reduces the premium each government pays to obtain insurance. Claims by participating governments are paid
  according to the occurrence of a predefined event (e.g., a hurricane of a given category within a predefined spatial extent).

  The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (GFDRR 2011) is a public entity that provides compulsory property earthquake and
  fire insurance to homeowners through multiple insurance companies. Affordable premiums are offered through the pool
  by aggregating risks from policies across Turkey into one portfolio. The pool transfers a portion of risk to the international
  reinsurance markets. The pool has succeeded in growing the catastrophe insurance market in Turkey; 3.5 million policies were
  sold in 2010 compared to 600,000 before the TCIP was established in 2000.

  The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative includes the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot, which allows
  Pacific countries to buy catastrophe insurance as a single group (pooling their risks into a single portfolio) (GFDRR 2015).
  Like the CCRIF, it uses predefined parametric triggers. The pilot provides an immediate payout to a participating government
  affected by an event meeting the predefined criteria.

  African Risk Capacity (ARC) (African Risk Capacity 2013) is a parametric-based pan-African funding mechanism for extreme
  weather events, covering drought initially but with plans to also cover flood. By pooling risks from governments across Africa,
  those risks are diversified, with the pool paying out on some events and transferring some risk to the international markets.
  Governments may choose to retain low-level risk, which requires them to cover losses from frequent or small events themselves.
