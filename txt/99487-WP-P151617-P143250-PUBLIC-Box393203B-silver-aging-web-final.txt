Executive Summary
Russia’s population is expected to age significantly over the next few decades. Declining
fertility, increasing life expectancy, and the retirement of the large numbers of people born in the
1950s are expected to reduce the working-age population by perhaps 14 percent over the next
35 years. If there is no change in labor force participation (LFP) rates, Russia’s workforce could
decline by more than 20 million workers, and the dependency ratio could rise by more than 50
percent.

The coming decline in Russia’s working-age population will pose serious social and
economic challenges, but it can also open up opportunities. All too often, aging is viewed as
a malevolent social force that will depress investment and productivity, disrupt fiscal balances,
impose intolerable care burdens on the relatively young, and severely impair the health,
finances, and life satisfaction of the elderly. The gloomiest forecasts for the impact of aging
generally extrapolate current behavior and institutions onto a future, older society. For example,
a lot more elderly people suffering from cancer and cardiovascular disease at unchanged age-
incidence rates would overwhelm health care systems. Similarly, a large increase in the elderly
dependent population with unchanged lifecycle savings patterns and retirement ages would
overburden pension systems. Fortunately, individual behavior does change in reaction to
aging – and policies can. Thus, better health services and changes in lifestyle could dramatically
improve health outcomes for the elderly and, in conjunction with changes to discourage early
retirement, encourage them to work to older ages and ease pressures on financing pensions. The
right policies would help Russians achieve longer, more prosperous, and more satisfying lives.

Without adequate adjustments of policies and behaviors, an aging population could
impair national growth and fiscal sustainability. Since the early 1990s, increases in the
working-age population have accounted for about a third of the growth in per capita GDP. Absent
changes in individual behavior and government policies, over the next few decades the rise in
the dependency ratio could reduce growth by 2 percentage points (pp) a year. One important
channel is savings, which with unchanged, lifecycle-based savings rates could plunge as the
population ages. Aging could also substantially increase spending on health care and pensions,
leading to protracted deficits that boost the debt-to-GDP ratio from 20 percent of GDP now to
over 100 percent by 2050.

These pessimistic forecasts, however, are based on the unrealistic assumption that
individuals and government policy will not change. Adjustments to policies and behavior
could markedly reduce the impact of aging on savings, LFP, growth, the fiscal accounts, and the
incidence of disease. Individuals who expect to live longer could save more and work longer,
in anticipation of a longer retirement. An increase in the official retirement age, which is low in
Russia by international standards, would encourage longer working lives and reduce the fiscal
burden of pensions. The government also could help the elderly to work longer, and improve
their productivity, by encouraging firms to introduce age-appropriate management policies (for
example, reducing the physical demands of the workplace) and by vigorously enforcing bans on
age discrimination. And since poor health is the most common reason for retirement, screening
and preventive services, coupled with cutting down on habits that are all too widespread
in Russia (smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diets, and limited exercise), could
markedly improve the health status of the elderly, again lengthening their working lives and
raising their productivity.
8              Searching for a New Silver Age in Russia: The Drivers and Impacts of Population Aging



    Achieving healthy, active, and prosperous aging will require policy changes across a host
    of areas. Many of the policies required to confront the challenges of aging – such as reducing
    Russia’s high rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer, providing adult workers with the
    education they need to succeed in a globalized economy, and supporting gender equality to
    improve the tradeoffs that women face between work and having a family – would in any event
    improve the economic and physical well-being of Russian citizens, young and old. Population
    aging makes policy reform more urgent and may affect what issues move to the top of the
    agenda, but it does not dramatically alter the desirability of individual policies.

    Policies to support women could both limit population aging and increase labor force
    participation. Demographic trends are primarily determined by the age structure of the
    population. However, while many Russian families have only one child, most parents would like to
    have at least two, indicating that there may be some scope for policy to facilitate the attainment
    of desired fertility. Adequate resources are critical to decisions to have children. However, Russian
    pro-natalist policies are excessively focused on financial transfers, which tend to affect the timing
    of births but not the ultimate number of children. And some aspects of these policies, such as
    extended and partially-unpaid maternity leave, may reduce the attachment of young mothers
    to the labor force. Inadequate formal childcare options also prevent mothers from returning
    to the labor market. Providing more stable employment and career opportunities, adequate
    childcare services, and greater flexibility in work arrangements for women and their spouses
    could improve their ability to reconcile family and work, thus supporting both higher fertility
    rates and employment.

    Changes in behavior and policy could greatly mitigate the impact of aging on growth and
    fiscal sustainability. Longer working lives and policies to encourage greater LFP could markedly
    improve the prospects for growth. For example, raising the official retirement age to 65 for both
    men and women could significantly improve the impact of the demographic structure on GDP
    growth, so that demographic change would increase GDP by 0.6 percent for the next 15 years.
    By 2050, policies to promote LFP, coupled with more optimistic forecasts for demographic trends
    and natural resource revenues, would reduce the forecasts for pension fund deficits by more
    than 1 percent of GDP per year and for public debt from about 100 percent of GDP to essentially
    zero. Modifying the rule for setting aside a portion of oil and gas revenues to guarantee a certain
    level of savings annually could also help make the fiscal position more sustainable.

    Promoting adult education and better age-management human resources policies at the
    firm level is essential to improve the employment prospects for older workers and raise
    productivity across the age spectrum. It has recently been found that older workers retain the
    ability to concentrate and to learn new skills well past retirement age. Improvements in social
    skills and increased experience tend to compensate for a decline in some other skills, such as
    mental speed and physical strength. In Russia, however, a lack of opportunities to polish skills
    and prepare for a second career limits the contribution that older workers can make; it also
    reduces their incentive to continue working. Less than 30 percent of adult workers participate
    in either informal or formal training, well below the average of OECD countries and some
    Eastern European neighbors. Participation by older workers is particularly low. For example, the
    participation rate of workers over 60 years in continuous professional education (CPE) is less
    than half that of prime-age workers. Certain age-management strategies, such as deployment of
    mixed-age teams and workplace adjustments to suit the needs of older workers, can help firms
    to retain their mature talent and can not only enhance the productivity of older workers but also
    have spillovers on younger and prime-aged colleagues.

This volume presents research from the World Bank on the impact of demographic trends
in Russia. A comprehensive agenda on population aging would encompass three interrelated
policy areas aiming at healthy, active, and prosperous aging (Figure 1). It could also include
policies aimed at slowing down population aging by raising fertility rates and/or encouraging
net migration. The current report is not intended to cover all the aspects of the multi-faceted
aging agenda. Instead, in consultation with Russian policymakers and academics, several under-
studied topics were selected. Some issues, like the reform of health care services and migration
policy, were thus left for future research. The first section focuses on the macroeconomic impacts
of aging and considers how aging has affected GDP growth and convergence among Russian
regions since the early 1990s; it also offers alternative approaches to forecasting the relationship
between aging and growth. This is followed by an analysis of the effect of aging on household
savings and a discussion of the fiscal implications of aging. The second section, dealing with the
relationship of human development outcomes and demographics, discusses how family policies
can help women have more children and still attain greater and longer participation in the labor
force. Changes in retirement incentives, health services, social protection policies, and the rules
governing the labor market that could promote active aging are then considered. The last part
of this section addresses the role of adult education in improving Russia’s competitiveness and
enabling longer and more productive working lives. A final section pulls together the main
conclusions.

                 1. The Macroeconomic Impact of Aging



                 Over the past few decades Russia has benefited from a demographic dividend. During the
                 transition of the early 1990s, the population was predominantly young, the dependency ratio
                 low, and large cohorts of people were entering the labor market. The ratio of the dependent
                 population (aged less than 15 or more than 64) to the working-age population (aged 15 to 64)
                 dropped between 1995 to 2010 by more than 11 percentage points, as the working-age popu-
                 lation expanded but total population fell. Many emerging markets experienced an even greater
                 increase in the share of the working-age population and have grown rapidly as a result (see, for
                 example, Aiyar and Mody 2011 and Bloom and Finlay 2009 for South Asia; and Wang and Mason
                 2008 for China). During the transition to a market economy in Russia, however, the impact of
                 this demographic dividend was swamped by profound economic and political disruptions. Still,
                 demographic trends made a significant contribution to growth after the transition period end-
                 ed. Since 2000 the rise in the workforce has been boosted by the high and increasing LFP rate
                 (Figures 2 and 3).

                 The demographic dividend was responsible for about one-third of Russia’s per capita
                 GDP growth from 1997 to 2011. To calculate the impact of demographic changes on growth,
                 the historical growth rate was compared with growth estimates generated by an econometric
                 model (Box 1), with the assumption that the age structure had remained constant from 1997 on.
                 The difference between these two scenarios, which equals almost one-third of per capita GDP
                 growth from 1997 to 2011, represents the effect of demographic change on growth. This finding
                 is similar to the estimates for the demographic dividend in East Asia and slightly lower than the
                 estimate of 40 percent for India.

   Box 1. An Econometric Estimation of the Impact of Aging
   on Growth
   Econometric analysis can be used to measure the relationship between demographic
   change and growth across Russia’s regions. On the conditional convergence assumption,
   per capita GDP growth in each region depends on the distance between the level of GDP
   per capita and a steady-state level, plus a parameter that indicates the speed at which
   the economy approaches the steady state. This relationship, along with a series of control
   variables, can measure the impact of the share of the population that is of working age
   on per capita GDP.

   Many different econometric specifications of the model have been explored. In the main
   one, which follows Aiyar and Mody (2011), the sample is split into five-year time periods.
   This approach recognizes that demographic variables tend to change slowly, even in
   Russia, which experienced relatively fast demographic shifts during this period.

   The relationship between per capita GDP in the initial period and the growth rate of per
   capita GDP is negative and significant (see Table B1.1), confirming economic convergence.
   A 1 pp rise in the working-age ratio, adjusted for migration, increases the growth of GDP
   per capita by 1.6 percent.

Since the mid-1990s, demographic trends also have helped to reduce inequality across
Russian regions. Regions with per capita GDP below the median of regional averages in
1996 (“poor” regions) grew more rapidly than regions with per capita GDP above the median
(“rich” regions). This convergence was in part due to differences in demographic trends: poor
regions experienced a larger increase in the working-age population up to 2007, and since the
early 2000s a faster drop in dependency ratios compared to rich regions (Figure 4). Using the
econometric model described in Box 1, and controlling for differences in economic, geographic,

                                             from 1997 to 2011 is estimated at 1.7 percent per year, while the corresponding contribution for
                                             rich regions was 1.3 percent (Table 1).

                                             Russia’s labor force is set to shrink. Assuming no sudden changes in LFP rate profiles, Russia’s
                                             labor force could shrink by 20–23 million workers between 2010 and 2050, based on the Rosstat
                                             low and UNPD medium-fertility demographic projections (Figure 5).1 Some shrinkage of both
                                             the younger (aged 15–39) and prime-aged (40–64) labor force is expected in the current decade,
                                             with a much more drastic decrease in the 2020s, when Russia is projected to lose more than 7
                                             million younger workers as the small cohorts born during the transition years of the 1990s enter
                                             the workforce. Although the prime-aged labor force will still be increasing, the 2020s is be the
                                             first real decade of aging in the labor force, as the median age of workers goes up significantly
                                             and the total workforce shrinks by about 5 million people. The massive declines in young workers
                                             during the 2020s will reverberate through the age pyramid in the 2030s and 2040s, when almost
                                             10 million older workers are expected to leave the workforce. Although the number of younger
                                             workers will go up slightly, by less than a million, in the 2030s, in the 2040s this age group begins
                                             to shrink again, reflecting the likely results of the low fertility rate of the 2000s.

                                             In principle, population aging can act as a drag on growth. An aging population can constrain
                                             growth through four channels: (1) Aging can reduce the number of workers, which could lower
                                             output. (2) The elderly may save less than those of working age, so that population aging could
                                             lead to lower savings and thus lower investment. (3) To the extent that the workforce is aging
                                             and skills become progressively obsolete, labor productivity may fall. (4) An aging population is
                                             likely to increase demands on public resources, due to greater needs for health care and long-

effect on pension revenues and expenditures. The increased burden of spending for an aging

Assuming no change in individual behavior or government policies, population aging could
reduce the growth of Russia’s per capita GDP. The past relationship between the increase in the
working-age population and the growth in per capita GDP (as calculated above) can be combined
with a forecast of the working-age population to generate a forecast for growth. While in the past
the rise in the working-age population helped to boost growth in GDP, in future a decline in
that population could constrain growth. Rosstat’s official demographic forecast envisions three
scenarios (low, medium, and high demographic), with the contribution of population aging to
growth in per capita GDP ranging from a negative 1.5 percent to a negative 2.3 percent (Table 2).2
Absent any changes in policy, GDP growth is projected to average about 1.3 percent for 2015–
40 for growth in the medium demographic scenario; in the low demographic scenario annual
growth is unlikely to exceed 1.0 percent. The demographic burden up to 2030 is actually higher
in the high demographic scenario, as most of the additional children enter the labor market only
after 2030. In all three scenarios, the dependency rate rises more in poor regions than in rich, so
that demographic change may increase inequality between regions (Table 2).

The impact of future demographic change on growth can also be estimated using a
standard growth accounting framework (Box 2). Two sets of projections are developed for
each of Rosstat’s three demographic scenarios. The first set (scenarios A) projects potential GDP
growth assuming adoption of labor market policies to enlarge the size of Russia’s workforce. The
second set (scenarios B) projects potential GDP growth without such labor market policies. The
policy scenarios are described below:

Although levels may differ slightly, because the trends and structures are similar in both, they do not make a material
difference to the conclusions.

        • Baseline scenario A – medium demographic scenario with policy reform. This scenario as-
          sumes a gradual increase in the fertility rate from the current 1.6 live births to 1.9 by 2050
          and an increase in life expectancy from 70.0 years to 77.4. The government adopts policy
          improvements that increase LFP. This scenario also assumes that institutional changes have a
          moderately positive impact on total factor productivity (TFP) growth.
        • Upper-bound scenario A – high demographic scenario with policy reform. This scenario re-
          flects optimistic demographic assumptions, including the convergence of life expectancy to
          OECD levels and gradually increasing fertility rates that reach 2.2 live births by 2050. As in
          the baseline A, this scenario assumes that labor market policies have a positive effect on the
          workforce and institutional changes have a similar positive impact on TFP growth.
        • Lower-bound scenario A – low demographic scenario with policy reform. This scenario re-
          flects Rosstat’s pessimistic demographic scenario, which assumes a decline in the fertility
          rate from 1.6 live births to 1.4 in 2020–40 and then an increase to 1.5 by 2050. Life expectancy
          is expected to increase marginally, to 71.2 years by 2050. As in the baseline scenario A, this
          scenario assumes that labor market policies have a positive effect on the workforce and in-
          stitutional changes have a similar positive impact on TFP growth.
        • Baseline scenario B – medium demographic scenario without policy reform. This scenario is
          based on the same demographic projections as the baseline scenario A. However, the gov-
          ernment does not adopt any changes to labor market policies or improve the institutional
          environment.
        • Upper-bound scenario B – high demographic scenario without policy reform. This scenario is
          based on the same demographic projections as the upper-bound scenario A. However, the
          government does not adopt any changes to labor market policies or improve the institutional
          environment..
        • Lower-bound scenario B – low demographic scenario without policy reform. This scenario is
          based on the same demographic projections as the lower-bound scenario A. However, the
          government does not adopt any changes to labor market policies or improve the institutional
          environment.

     If there are no changes in policies, aging especially reduces potential GDP growth in
     2015–20 (Table 3). A comparison of growth forecasts in the three demographic scenarios provides
     an estimate of the marginal impact of aging and the fall in the labor force on growth. In the scenarios
     without labor market reforms – baseline (B), upper-bound (B) and lower-bound (B) – continued
     structural weakness coupled with negative demographics limit the growth rate of potential
     output in 2015-40 to 1.6 percent a year in baseline (B), 1.3 percent in upper-bound (B), and
     0.9 percent in lower-bound (B). The differences between the growth rates of potential output
     between scenarios, 0.3 and 0.4 pps a year, reflect more pessimistic assumptions for demographic
     change. Potential GDP growth looks particularly bleak in 2015–20, with annual average growth
     forecast to be in the range of 0.4–0.5 percent for all three scenarios. The differences in the growth
     rate of potential output between the B scenarios rise over time, reaching 0.6 percent in the last
     decade (2031–40) of the forecast period (potential GDP rises at 2.3 percent a year in the upper-
     bound scenario, 1.7 percent in the baseline, and 1.1 percent in the lower-bound).

The forecasts from both models, which anticipate slow growth due to population aging,
depend crucially on the assumption that individual behavior and government policy will
not change in reaction to aging. While useful in gauging the challenge that aging may present,
this assumption is unrealistic. People do change their behavior in reaction to demographic
changes. For example, individuals who expect to live longer may increase their savings or work
longer to ensure that they have sufficient resources to support their longer lives. Governments
can change the rules governing pensions to ensure their financial sustainability, which will in
turn encourage changes in the willingness of individuals to work. Such changes could mitigate or
even reverse the expected impact of aging on income. Studies of the effect of population aging
on growth in developed economies emphasize the essential role of policy responses related to
retirement incentives, investments in health care and education, migration, and flexible labor-
force policies in mitigating the negative effects of aging on LFP and economic growth (see
Bloom, Canning and Fink, 2008 and 2011; and Kelly and Schmidt, 2005).

Policy reform could have a significant impact on dependency ratios and growth in Russia.
Russia has a relatively low statutory retirement age, currently 55 for women and 60 for men.
Increases in the retirement age, which may be entirely feasible given expected improvements in
life expectancy, could encourage people to work longer, thus mitigating the impact of aging on
growth. Based on the growth convergence model (Box 1), an increase in the retirement age from
55 to 65 for women and from 60 to 65 years for men would sufficiently increase the size of the
labor force that demographic change would make a net positive contribution to growth through
2050: based on the growth accounting framework (see Box 2), the higher retirement age would
add 2–3 million people to the labor force by 2050. The projections show two main results: (1) The
marginal impact on growth of raising the retirement age is similar in all three scenarios, reflecting
the similar growth rate of the pension-eligible population. (2) The marginal impact on growth
is estimated to be negligible in the early years of the forecast period but more significant later,
reaching 0.22 pps a year in the last five years.


   Box 2. A Growth Accounting Framework
   To forecast Russia’s long-term growth, a standard growth accounting framework
   was applied using a production function. The simulation framework has three main
   components: a labor force block, a savings block, and a current account block. In the labor
   force block, the size of the economically active population is estimated based on official
   demographic projections. In the savings block, gross savings by households, businesses,
   and the general government are estimated to calculate the aggregate national savings
   rate. The current account block is estimated using the IMF methodologya for projecting
   the long-run equilibrium ratio of the current account to GDP. Fixed capital stock is forecast
   based on estimates for national savings and the current account. Finally, the labor force
   and fixed capital stock forecasts are used to calculate projections of potential GDP using
   the following production function:



        where
        u_k – capital utilization rate
        k_a – fixed capital stock
        u     – unemployment rate
        eap – economically active population
        tfp_g – total factor proctivity growth

                        Reforms that could mitigate the impact of demographic change on growth go well beyond
                       changing the retirement age. The Russian government has articulated a number of measures
                       to increase the participation in the labor force of women, youth, and older adults, including
                       developing child care infrastructure, reducing informal employment, and allowing more flexible
                       work arrangements (policies that could improve incentives for older adults to keep working
                       are discussed in detail in the second section of this report). Scenario analysis based on growth
                       accounting can be used to estimate the impact of these reforms. The scenarios also include
                       educational and health reforms that would heighten human capital and productivity, based on
                       calculations using the institutional environments index (IMF 2012)3. The aggregate impact of
                       policies and institutional change on growth reflects impact on both the size of the labor force and
                       TFP. Even with conservative assumptions for the TFP growth rate, the aggregate marginal impact
                       of labor policies and institutional changes is estimated in the range of 0.34–0.55 pp a year, which
                       explains about a quarter of the GDP growth projected for 2015–40. It should be noted that in
                       the baseline and lower-bound scenarios the impact of labor market policies on growth is smaller
                       than the rise in TFP assumed for the scenarios with labor market policies. This has important
                       implications in terms of which policies the government could adopt to push up Russia’s long-
                       term growth potential. In sum, while differing in the assumptions and the magnitude of the
                       impact, both modeling exercises demonstrate that policy changes can do much to limit the
                       adverse impact of population aging on growth.

                       Better labor market policies would have more impact on LFP for the young and the elderly
                       than for working-age individuals. The LFP of both women and men aged 24–55 is already
                       relatively high in Russia, and for women it exceeds the OECD average. Thus, improved labor
                       policies are not likely to raise the economic activity of these groups. It is estimated that better
                       labor policies would increase the LFP of men aged 24–45 by less than 2 pps over the forecast
                       period and by even less for women in this age group. However, economic activity among the
                       elderly and youth of both genders is quite low in Russia. Thus, improved labor policies (without
                       changing the retirement age) would raise the LFP of both females and males aged 20–24 by an
                       estimated 5 pps, and by even more among those aged 55–65. The estimated impact of these
                       improvements on the size of Russia’s workforce would exceed that of raising the retirement age
                       in the baseline and upper-bound scenarios and have a comparable impact in the low scenario
                       (Figure 6).

The marginal impact of proactive labor policies on long-term growth is likely to be uneven
across the scenarios and could be greater in the early projection decades. The marginal
impact of labor policies on growth in the baseline (0.17 pp) and lower-bound (0.11 pp) scenarios
over the projection period (Figure 7). Yet, in the upper-bound scenario, the effect of labor
policies is almost double the one in the baseline: 0.31 pp. The effect peaks in the first decade of
the forecast period and diminishes with time in all three scenarios; convergence to maximum
possible LFP rates is expected to be complete by the mid-2030s. For example, in the baseline
scenario active labor policies could add 0.21 pps annually to the growth rate in 2015–30, but
only 0.11 pps in the last decade of projections. Moreover, in both the baseline and lower-bound
scenarios, the policies assumed would not be enough to eliminate the negative contribution
of labor to growth – the negative effect of demographics is likely to outweigh the positive effect
of labor policies.

Despite the large variation between scenarios in the marginal effect of labor policies on
growth, the relative contribution to growth – measured as the ratio of marginal effect in each
year to overall growth – is likely to be similar. This suggests that the relative effectiveness of
labor policies is likely to be the same regardless of demographic trends. The relative contribution
to growth is also estimated to be much larger in the early years of the projection period than in
the outer years (Figure 8). This reflects much weaker growth potential in the early years due to
the negative contribution of the capital stock to growth. That labor policies would be much more
effective in earlier periods is good news for Russia’s policy-makers, given that the output gap for
the Russian economy is likely to stay negative for the next decade.

  2. The Impact of Aging on Household
  Savings


Lower savings by an aging population can reduce growth. One way aging affects growth is
that the elderly tend to save less than those of working age. The lifecycle hypothesis (Modigliani
and Brumberg 1954) assumes that people smooth their consumption over time by building up
assets throughout their working lives and drawing down wealth in old age. A possible implication
is that aggregate savings will decline as the elderly share of the population rises, thus reducing
the funds available for investment, and therefore growth. Estimating the historical relationship
between savings and population aging can provide a useful insight on how aging affects growth.

Estimating the impact of aging on savings requires data that accurately reflect savings.
The raw data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) show that savings rates
actually rise with age, and older households have the highest saving rates; in other words, the life
cycle hypothesis does not hold. However, this finding is based on an inappropriate accounting for
pension receipts and expenditures. That is, households tend to report pension payments received
under any scheme as part of income, even though a substantial fraction actually represents the
drawing-down of assets (Deaton 2005a; UN 2009). Meanwhile, young people do not report the
contributions employers make to pension plans as part of their income. As a result, household
survey data understate both the income (and therefore saving) of the young and the dissaving
of the old. Correcting this distortion requires adding employer pension plan contributions to
household income, and subtracting the portion of pension receipts that represent the drawdown
of assets from household income. However, this is easier said than done (Box 3).


   Box 3. Correcting Household Survey Data to Accurately
   Reflect the Role of Pensions
     Two major issues arise in adjusting household savings for pension contributions and
   receipts: (1) Household survey data generally do not report the fraction of gross pre-
   retirement income that is used to finance accrued pension entitlements. Imputing these
   contributions is extremely difficult due to the complexity of the pension system, which
   applies different rules to certain groups of pensioners and people of different birth
   cohorts, in part as a result of numerous pension reforms. (2) Classifying the contributions
   mandated by federal, state, and local government pension and insurance schemes as
   saving and the pension benefits received from those funds after reaching retirement age
   as dissaving, is problematic because these flows are required by government rather than
   reflecting household decisions (Gale and Sabelhaus 1999).
   The following two scenarios follow the methodology suggested by Lustig and Higgins
   (2013): (1) a benchmark case in which pension receipts from any scheme are treated as
   social transfers, so that no adjustment is made to the survey data; and (2) an alternative in
   which survey data are adjusted so that pension fund contributions and receipts enter into
   the savings aggregate – in other words, all pension receipts are considered a drawdown
   of post-retirement wealth and hence dissaving. The realistic outcome is assumed to fall
   between the two extremes.
   For the second, pension-adjusted case, pension contributions are imputed by estimating
   the contribution rate that, if applied to all forms of labor income, would balance the
   pension fund, i.e., the one that equilibrates pension contributions and receipts. Though
Overview Report                                                                                                                                19




                            given the complexity of the Russian pension system, this method is very rough, it provides
                            a useful starting point. The estimated contribution rate of 24.18 percent closely matches
                            the official insurance premium rate of the Pension Fund of Russia applied to wages below
                            a set ceiling, which was fixed at 22.0 percent in 2012.a
                            For each household, the net difference between imputed pension fund contributions
                            and observed pension receipts is added to the savings calculation. Due to the imputation
                            method, total pension contributions and receipts balance at the aggregate level, so that
                            total household saving (aggregating across all age groups) is identical in both scenarios.
                            However, in the adjusted case, pension fund contributions enter into the calculation of
                            gross disposable income, which changes the calculation of savings rates for each age
                            group.

Properly estimated, Russian savings trends are consistent with the lifecycle hypothesis.
Savings based on the data adjusted for pensions are estimated as a function of age, income,
cohort effects (differences between age groups that reflect the experiences and preferences of
each group, rather than aging), and the business cycle. Savings rates are found to rise with the
age of the household head during working-age years, peaking at about age 50 (Figure 9, top
panel). By ages 75–80, about 90 percent of all resources available to the household represent a
drawdown of accumulated wealth. Individuals born between 1920 and 1940 tend to have lower

20                          Searching for a New ”Silver Age” in Russia: The Drivers and Impacts of Population Aging



                savings, while savings rates seem to be higher for each successive cohort born after World War II.
                In short, after controlling for other influences on savings particularly cohort effects, savings rates
                tend to rise during middle-age working years and decline after retirement.

                Projections of the impact of population aging on savings rates depend on assumptions
                about demographic change. Forecasting savings rates over 35 years requires assumptions
                about future demographic changes that are extremely uncertain. It is therefore useful to present
                scenarios for changes in savings rates that reflect different assumptions for population growth
                and cohort effects (that is, behavior of cohorts born in the future that is unrelated to aging)4. The
                former are based on adopting the Rosstat low, medium, and high population scenarios. These
                assumptions have only limited impact on the savings rates forecast, which differ by only a few
                percentage points from the low to high scenario (Figure 10).

                By contrast, the assumptions made for the savings preferences of future cohorts have a
                very significant impact on the projected savings rate. On the one hand, it might be assumed
                that all future new-born generations have the same cohort effect on savings as that estimated
                for the youngest cohort observed in the data. In that case, savings are projected to decline as
                the Russian population ages, so that the savings rate forecast is hump-shaped (Figure 10A). The
                aggregate household savings rate is expected to increase up to about 2030. As the share of older
                age groups rises thereafter, the projected savings rates flatten until 2040 and then decline. Given
                the high rates of dissaving in old age, the projected decrease in the aggregate savings rate is
                most pronounced in the low population growth scenario, in which the elderly constitute the
                largest population share. An alternative assumption is that the cohort effect on savings in future
                generations follows the increasing trend shown in the historical data. In that case, the aggregate
                household savings rate increases throughout the forecast horizon (Figure 10B).

                  Since large differences in the savings behavior of household heads with different levels of education were not seen,
                and since general equilibrium effects complicate forecasts for the future accumulation of human capital, the scenario
                analysis is based on the coefficients estimated for the total population. The analysis also abstracts from business cycle
                fluctuations, i.e., the time effects are set to zero, so that any projected trend in savings rates is given by the combination
                of age and cohort effects.

It is important to take these forecasts with many grains of salt. The methodology relies on
the validity of the life cycle hypothesis, even though Deaton and Paxson (2000) conclude that not
all time trends in savings ratios can be fully explained within the lifecycle framework. Also, the
forecasts are based on microeconomic data that are not strictly comparable to macroeconomic
measurements of savings from national income accounts, both because of inconsistencies
between the consumption data from these two sources (see Ravallion 2003; Deaton 2005b;
Bourguignon 2015) and because the data are limited to households, while aggregate savings
also reflect decisions by firms and the government. The analysis of household saving behavior
can at best explain only about one-third of the change in total aggregate saving in Russia. Finally,
and most soberly for Russia’s prospects, future institutional changes can have major impacts on
saving behavior. Population aging is likely to increase pressures to reduce the generosity of the
pension system. This would result in households further reducing their savings in old age, which
could significantly reduce the supply of savings in the Russian economy.
  3. The Fiscal Implications of Aging



Demographic aging affects the size and composition of fiscal expenditures and revenues.
Aging can directly increase demand for publicly provided goods and services like health care and
long-term care. It can also increase claims on transfers like pension benefits. Aging also directly
affects revenues: the source of an individual’s income, and therefore the size of the tax base,
typically changes during the life cycle. For example, an increase in the share of retirees (with tax
rates unchanged) in the population may change the amount of taxes on wages compared to
unearned income. Aging can also affect the fiscal accounts indirectly, by changing the aggregate
level of income, which in turn affects expenditures and revenues. For example, if aging is associ-
ated with a rise in per capita income, then demand for health care services will also increase, as
those are normal goods. While not greatly affected by aging, an analysis of the prospects for fiscal
sustainability in Russia also needs to reflect the evolution of natural resource revenues, which
accounted for almost one-third of the country’s revenues in 2014.

Revenues from nonresource sectors are expected to increase relative to output.
Nonresource revenues are likely to rise faster than nonresource GDP. Income elasticity is greater
than 1 for nontax revenues and indirect taxes due to greater tax collection efforts and reductions
in informality, and for income taxes because in a progressive tax system higher incomes generate
an increase in marginal tax rates. In the baseline scenario, nonresource fiscal revenues increase
from about 28 percent of nonresource GDP in 2014 to 32 percent by 2050. In comparison, fiscal
revenues reach 30 percent of nonresource GDP in the pessimistic and 36 percent in the optimistic
boundary scenarios (Box 4 defines the three scenarios).


   Box 4. Scenario Analysis
   Even if many components are uncertain, a scenario approach is useful in projecting
   Russian GDP. This analysis gives three alternative demographic indicators (total
   population, age composition of the population, and labor force), three scenarios for labor
   productivity, three oil and gas price forecasts, and two labor policy scenarios, for a total of
   54 alternative GDP forecasts. As it is not feasible to discuss all the scenarios individually, and
   to avoid an arbitrary mapping between different variables, the analysis here aggregates
   all scenarios to focus on a baseline, an optimistic boundary, and a pessimistic boundary,
   defined as follows:
       • Baseline: medium variants of forecasts for demographic variables, labor force, labor
         productivity, and oil and gas prices, but no government policies that boost labor force
         participation (LFP).
       • Optimistic boundary: high variants of forecasts for demographic variables, labor
         force, labor productivity, and oil and gas prices, and government policies that boost
         LFP.
       • Pessimistic boundary: low variants of forecasts for demographic variables, labor
         force, labor productivity, and oil and gas prices, and no government policies that
         boost LFP.a
Overview Report                                                                                                                                                         23




        Simulations show a gradual slowdown in GDP in the long run. In the baseline scenario,
        non-oil GDP growth rises to 2.3 percent by 2018 and then gradually declines to 1.6 percent
        a year over the long term, mainly reflecting a more pronounced fall in the labor force
        in the outer years.b The optimistic boundary envisages long-term growth of about 2.7
        percent and the pessimistic boundary 0.4 percent a year. Policies that encourage greater
        LFP prove to be effective in boosting GDP: by 2050, the rise in the labor force increases
        GDP by about 6 percentage points compared to the baseline scenario. This gain exceeds
        the positive effects of higher oil prices.

        Monte Carlo simulations with stochastic shocks in the growth of labor productivity
        and oil prices are used to determine the likelihood of alternative scenarios (the
        demographic trend is kept at the baseline values). Allowing 500 draws from identically
        and independently distributed shocks over time, the simulations form confidence
        intervals around the baseline scenario. For example, in 2050, GDP per capita is expected
        to be between $22,000 and $29,000 90 percent of the time.
        a
          Note that a low demographic scenario could be associated with greater per capita income because the old-
        age dependency ratio is greater in the high demographic scenario. However, this selection is still relevant for
        considering the fiscal implications of aging.
        b
          A recent study by the Gaidar Institute (Goryunov et al. 2013) performs a similar projection, and the GDP growth
        rate has a similar downward trend.



The share of natural resource revenues in total fiscal revenues is projected to fall. Based on
World Bank and IMF forecasts, this analysis assumes that between 2014 and 2050 oil production
gradually decreases from 520 million to 436 million tons , while natural gas production increases
from 670 billion to 810 billion cubic meters. The price of oil is projected to stabilize over the
long term at $105 a barrel in the baseline scenario.5 As a result, although rising, natural resource
revenues fail to keep pace with the growth in nonresource revenues, and the share of natural
resources in fiscal revenues drops from about 30 percent in 2014 to 14 percent by 2030
(Figure 11).

  The optimistic scenario, which exhibits medium-term behavior close to U.S. Energy Information Administration
projections, suggests a gradual increase and stabilization at about $122 a barrel. The pessimistic scenario, which is similar
to IMF projections for the medium term, envisions a decline to $69 a barrel.

                                         Expenditures that are sensitive to demographic changes are forecast to rise. By 2050, the
                                         government’s noninterest expenditures are expected to increase from 36.7 percent of GDP in
                                         2014 to 37.8 percent in the baseline and 42.3 percent in the pessimistic boundary, although they
                                         decrease to 32.8 percent in the optimistic boundary (Figure12). In the baseline, efficiency gains
                                         are assumed to reduce spending that is not related to the age composition of the population.
                                         Thus, the increase in primary spending is mainly driven by demography-related expenditures,6
                                         which rise from about 32 percent of the total in 2014 to 49 percent by 2050 (Figure 12). The
                                         share of education spending remains stable as rising incomes increase demand, but the number
                                         of youths changes little over the forecast period. The share of health care spending increases
                                         by about 3 pps due to increased demand from both rising incomes and aging. However, the
                                         largest demography-related increase in public spending consists of transfers to the pension
                                         fund, the share of which in noninterest expenditures rises by about 14 pps through 2050, or
                                         from about 4 percent of total revenues to 8 percent or more in the three scenarios.7 The differing
                                         paths of pension fund deficits over time reflect the interaction between GDP levels and old-
                                         age dependency ratios. The optimistic boundary has the highest GDP and the highest old-age
                                         dependency ratio of the three scenarios. In the 2030s, these two factors result in a higher pension
                                         fund deficit than under the pessimistic boundary. By 2050, however, the impact of increasing
                                         GDP dominates, and the optimistic boundary has the lowest pension fund deficit as a share of
                                         GDP.

                                         All told, the rise in noninterest expenditures exceeds the increase in revenues, leading to
                                         protracted primary (noninterest) deficits in coming decades. In the baseline simulations, the
                                         long-term primary deficit is expected to widen to 3 percent of GDP (Figure 13A). In the optimistic
                                         boundary, the deficit goes up to 1.1 percent of GDP in the medium term but then gradually
                                         narrows to a surplus in the second half of the projection period. In contrast, in the pessimistic
                                         boundary the primary deficit rapidly deteriorates to 6 percent of GDP and ultimately reaches 9
                                         percent by 2050.

                                         Persistent fiscal deficits would push up public debt dramatically. The overall balance (which
                                         includes interest payments) is projected to remain at about 4 percent of GDP throughout
                                         the baseline forecast. The interest rate on Russia’s debt is well below the rate of GDP growth.8

                                           Demography-related expenditures are expenditures for education, health, and transfers to Pension Fund.

                                           Russia has recently reformed its pension system. However, at the time this report was prepared, specific details of the
                                         reform were not available. Thus, projections may vary if repeated with the new system parameters.

                                           Since the simulations assume 1 percent real interest rate on domestic debt and 1.2 percent on external debt, well below
                                         the 2.5 percent annual growth of GDP in the baseline, the debt burden assumptions are rather conservative.

Nevertheless, persistent deficits drive an increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio in the baseline
from less than 20 percent in 2014, when Russia was one of the least-indebted countries in the
world, to 116 percent by 2050 (Figure 13B). Public debt falls to just 0.3 percent of GDP in the
optimistic boundary but shoots up to 272 percent in the pessimistic boundary.

Changes in the forecast of the price of oil have the largest impact on debt-to-GDP ratios.
Switching from the baseline to the optimistic boundary assumption would reduce the ratio by
16.8 pps because of labor productivity, 24.9 pps because of labor market policies, and 43.3 pps
because of the oil price (Table 4). Changing oil prices has the largest impact on debt-to-GDP ratios
because oil price movements have a more direct effect on fiscal revenues than other changes.
Higher productivity and adoption of successful labor market polices also increase revenues,
because nonresource GDP is higher, but also heighten demand for public spending. By contrast,
oil prices have little impact on spending, so the net improvement in fiscal balances is greater
than for the other two variables.

Monte Carlo simulations show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to deteriorate
significantly. Based on 500 draws from identically and independently distributed shocks over
time, the simulations calculate confidence intervals around the baseline scenario. By 2050, the
overall deficit lies between 6.1 percent and 3.1 percent of GDP 90 percent of the time
(Figure 14). The public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be about 83 to 146 percent, with the
same probability.

                                     The current fiscal rule will not generate the savings required to cope with aging. In 2012,
                                     the Russian government introduced a new fiscal rule to reduce the volatility of spending and, in
                                     principle, save a portion of resource revenues for future use. Public spending from natural resource
                                     revenues is capped by a hypothetical earnings level based on a backward-looking benchmark
                                     price. Thus, when the oil price is higher than the historical average, a portion of the natural
                                     resource revenues is saved. When the oil price is lower than the historical average, a portion can
                                     be spent. This rule works well in dampening price-induced volatility in public spending, especially
                                     if prices have not been falling for more than three consecutive years. However, the current rule
                                     will not generate enough savings to meet the future needs of an aging society. Simulations with
                                     alternative price trajectories show that increases in oil and gas revenues could boost savings in
                                     the sovereign wealth funds. On the baseline assumptions, the Reserve Fund’s assets reach the
                                     ceiling (7 percent of GDP) by the middle of the forecast period, and the National Wealth Fund’s
                                     assets rise slightly as a share of GDP over the projection horizon. However, even if there are no
                                     withdrawals for other purposes from the National Wealth Fund, its portfolio will fall far short of
                                     what would be required to finance the widening deficit in the pension fund budget. The entire
                                     savings in this fund would be exhausted in financing the deficit for a single year. Changes in the
                                     fiscal rule to guarantee a certain level of savings annually (as Chile does) could ensure adequate
                                     savings in future and help finance the short-term costs of reforms to build a more sustainable
                                     fiscal position.

                                     Achieving long-term fiscal sustainability against unfavorable demographic trends will
                                     require targeted reforms – which can be costly. Because the fiscal problems led by aging are
                                     structural. Their permanent solutions need to be structural as well. Among such solutions are
                                     labor market policies that induce greater LFP, adjustments in retirement age and contribution
                                     rates, and steering of the pension system from unfunded to funded components. Simulations
                                     show that policies to raise LFP can cut about a quarter off the new debt. However, such reforms
                                     themselves can add to the fiscal burden. The important point is that a relatively small extra
                                     burden in the short and medium term may be desirable if it helps to avoid a much larger burden
                                     in the long term.

                                     Prompt action can avoid the projected deterioration in the fiscal outlook generated by
                                     aging demographics and structural transformation. The Russian government has the fiscal
                                     space to build up buffers for future imbalances. Over the last 15 years, except in 2014, rising oil

prices, tax reforms, and fiscal discipline, especially in the early 2000s, facilitated a substantial
reduction in Russia’s public debt. For the last 10 years its debt-to-GDP ratio has remained low,
and adjusted net savings, an indicator of long-term economic sustainability, have risen. In 2012,
Russia’s adjusted net savings were equal to 13.7 percent of gross national income (GNI), close to
the average level in countries with similar levels of income. Russia has room to adjust the current
fiscal rule so as to accumulate the resources required to stabilize the economy in the short and
medium term, finance policy reforms, and cope with long-term fiscal pressures.
                   4. Aging and Policies to Support
                   Families


             The coming decline in births underlines the importance of policies to support families who
             want more children. The increase in births in the early 2000s was mainly due to the favorable
             age structure, which in turn resulted from high fertility rates in the mid-1980s. Figure 15 provides
             a snapshot of fertility patterns over time in Russia. After 2014–15 the number of births is likely to
             begin declining, for four reasons: (1) The number of women of peak reproductive age (20–29) has
             begun to decline and by 2025 is expected to fall to almost half its 2010 level (Figure 16), and the
             number of marriages for women aged 18–34 has already begun to decline. (2) Russia is nearing
             the end of the fertility transformation, where the frequency distribution of births occurs at later
             ages (already, the age group with the most births has shifted from 20–24 to 25–29), while recov-
             ery of births postponed in the transition years has been relatively low. (3) The boost to fertility
             rates that followed introduction of pro-natalist policies in 2007 is expected to fade. Indeed, of
             people who had children after the pro-natalist measures took effect, only 6 percent felt the mea-
             sures helped them to have a child they could not otherwise afford (57 percent felt the measures
             had no effect, while of those who thought they did, almost 75 percent thought they affected only
             the timing of births).9 (4) The 1980s cohort, whose peak fertility coincided with the introduction
             of the pro-natalist measures, were more likely than later cohorts to come from families with two
             or more children and thus more likely to be responsive to incentives to have more children.

              While the degree of the perceived effect of the policy measures increases with more children, the effect on timing
             always dominates that of stimulation of additional births.

Childlessness and delayed childbearing are still relatively rare in Russia. Whereas the share
of childless women is high in countries like Italy, England, and Netherlands, the share of childless
women is relatively low in Russia (Figure 17): according to the 2010 Census, only about 6 percent
of women whose years of fertility were behind them had no biological children. Moreover, in
Russia and other post-communist countries, postponement of childbearing started later than in
Western Europe, and thus the average age at first birth is lower than in many European countries.
According to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the average age at first birth in
Russia was 24.6 years in 2009, compared to more than 28 in most Western European countries.
Hence, in Russia childlessness and delayed childbearing do not seem to be fundamental causes
of low fertility.

30                           Searching for a New Silver Age in Russia: The Drivers and Impacts of Population Aging



             The main driver of low fertility in Russia is the prevalence of one-child families. In 2010,
             more than two-thirds of Russian families had only one child. Comparing achieved fertility of the
             1965 cohort across countries in Figure 17, Russia has the highest share of one-child families (37
             percent of all families) and the second-lowest share (above only Italy’s) of multi-child families (55
             percent). As the propensity to have a second and subsequent child seems to distinguish low-
             fertility from high-fertility countries (Greulich et al. 2014), low prevalence of multi-child families
             seems to be a driver of Russia’s low fertility rate.

             Nevertheless, most Russians want two children. According to a 2012 survey,10 only about 12
             percent of women and men want to have a single child (Figure 18A). Slightly more than half
             of the women (51.7 percent) and 47.8 percent of men would like two children, provided they
             have adequate resources (housing, finance, and time). However, when asked about the expected
             number of children, 24.2 percent of women and 21.8 percent of men think that they will have
             only one. The difference between average children desired (2.29) and average expected (1.92)
             defines the gap between actual and potential fertility in Russia (Figure 18B). These preferences
             also indicate that striving to push fertility beyond two children will be difficult.

             Russian women face a trade-off between motherhood and work, with strong normative
             pressures to put family first. Desire for a professional career or a need to contribute to
             household income can raise the opportunity cost of having children, especially when work
             and family are difficult to reconcile. A woman with one child has sufficient information on
             the sacrifices involved in motherhood and the ability to combine work and family, can have a
             significant effect on her desire to have a second child. In Russia, care obligations impair women’s
             ability to combine family and career. According to the 2008 European Social Survey, about 66
             percent of women and almost 70 percent of men agreed or strongly agreed with the statement:
             “Women should be prepared to cut down on paid work for sake of family” (Figure 19), while in
             EU-15/EFTA (the European Free Trade Area) about 33 percent, and in ECA countries less than 60
             percent of respondents agreed with that statement. Given shortages of accessible childcare,
             many employed Russian women – between a quarter and a third, depending on the age
             group – work less than they would prefer due to family care obligations – a much higher share
             than in EU-15/EFTA countries and higher than the ECA average for women above 35 years.

For Russian women stable employment and access to formal childcare are positively
associated with aspirations and realizations of second-order births. Controlling for other
correlates of fertility, being in stable employment is associated with a significantly higher
probability of having a second child (Figure 20). A larger housing area, higher household
expenditures, and having a first child who is male and aged 3 or older are all correlated with a
higher likelihood of having a second child; having a newborn first child and being 35–39 years
old is associated with a lower probability of a second child. In terms of fertility aspirations, better-
educated mothers, those with more resources, and those whose first children attend formal
daycare more often are more likely to want a second child.

Since 2006 Russia has introduced a series of pro-natalist policies. From the start, the
emphasis was squarely on increasing second births. Major policy changes passed in 2006 and
implemented in 2007 included larger childcare benefits (paid up to 18 months after birth),
subsidies for preschool education, increasing the face value of “maternity certificates” for
prenatal and infant care, introducing a substantial financial transfer (maternity–or family–capital)
for a second child, extending monthly child benefits to nonworking women and paying more
for the second and subsequent child, and paying higher kindergarten subsidies for children
after the first. In 2008, ad hoc indexation of family support measures was replaced by a regular
inflation indexation mechanism for social benefits and payments. Child-related tax deductions
also became differentiated according to the birth order of the child. The federal programs were
complemented by varying levels of regional family support policies, with their generosity
dependent on available funds rather than the severity of the demographic crisis. However,
in 2013, 50 regions with unfavorable demographic situations and total fertility rates below
the Russian average received up to 90 percent cofinancing from the federal budget, with the
cofinancing to be reduced to 50 percent by 2018.

Several other federal policies have attempted to improve the tradeoff between work and
family, with varying degrees of success. Childcare benefits were extended to fathers in 1996,
and fathers are entitled to maternal (family) capital in case of the mother’s absence. While the
employment rights of pregnant women and mothers with young children are protected by
Russian law, these laws are rarely enforced, with courts often dismissing claims of unfair and
discriminatory treatment (World Bank 2014). Firms are given incentives to hire workers from
large families. Mothers returning to work are given free training (about 23,000 women took

                                             advantage of this in 2012-13), and there has been some improvement in access to preschool
                                             facilities, although the extensive system of extracurricular activities for children that existed in
                                             the Soviet Union was largely destroyed in the 1990s.

                                             Russia’s pro-natalist policy package is too focused on financial transfers. Russia’s policies
                                             emphasize financial assistance for families with young children (aged up to 18 months) and
                                             securing mothers’ jobs through a generous maternity leave mandate. As a result, many mothers
                                             of 18-month-olds have to remain on unpaid maternity leave after joining a long queue for a
                                             space in a public kindergarten. By focusing on cash transfers and encouraging mothers to stay at
                                             home to care for children, Russia risks following Germany, which struggles with a very low fertility
                                             rate despite its high investment in lump-sum grants and tax incentives for married couples with
                                             children (Greulich et al. 2014). By contrast, Nordic countries focus on supporting working parents
                                             of small children through expansion of childcare facilities and reliance on short but generously
                                             paid parental leave, including for fathers to encourage them to share childcare duties (Thévenon
                                             2011). These countries have seen a resurgence of fertility since the mid-1980s (Ronsen 2004).

                                             A more comprehensive approach is necessary to raise fertility. While the age structure of the
                                             population is the most important determinant of fertility, policies can help create an enabling
                                             environment in which families can achieve their fertility intentions without sacrificing their living

standards or raising their vulnerability to shocks. Financial transfers could support the living
standards of low-income families with children. Promoting greater gender equity within families
and in workplaces could improve the balance between work and motherhood for women (Billari
2008). Such policies might include provision of parental leave to fathers to encourage their
greater involvement in childcare, and reduction of the gender pay gap by enhancing women’s
work-related skills, removing legal and normative obstacles for women to enter occupations
traditionally reserved for men, introducing quotas to help women break through the glass
ceiling, and sponsoring public awareness campaigns to reduce gender stereotypes (World Bank
2014). Moreover, given the observed positive association between GDP growth and growth in
births in recent decades, policies to keep the economy stable can provide Russians with favorable
conditions for starting and expanding families.

Supporting stable employment of both mothers and fathers is important for raising fertility.
Policies improving labor market conditions for young parents (or potential parents) can reduce
the uncertainty and instability that discourages having children. Indeed, high unemployment
rates seem to contribute to postponement, and eventually, to reduction, of second-order births
(Adserà 2011). Providing sufficient opportunities for updating skills and retraining can improve
both the employability and earnings of parents, relaxing the immediate financial constraint on
having additional children and reducing the family’s vulnerability to future shocks. Child-related
income tax deductions can encourage mothers to return to the workforce and support disposable
family income. Tax exemptions have had a positive effect in the United States (Georgellis and
Wall 1992), Canada (Zhang et al. 1994), and Taiwan (Huang 2002). To make such deductions more
effective in stimulating fertility and female LFP, their coverage can be expanded by switching
from the current ceilings on each individual salary to a higher household-level threshold, so that
more households would be eligible. Moreover, information campaigns could raise awareness of
the availability of child-related income tax deductions, and tax preparation assistance can be
provided to families with two or more children. Finally, reducing the length of maternity leave
should be considered: excessively long maternity leave can reduce the probability of returning
to the labor market due to a depreciation in skills.

Making quality childcare more available can help women to combine motherhood and
work. There is robust evidence that improved childcare coverage can have a positive effect on
the probability of first and higher-order births (for example, Baizán 2009 for Spain; Del Boca et al.
2003 for Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain; Bauernschuster et al. 2013 for Germany). Long
waiting lists for public kindergartens in Russia and lack of options for private childcare create
difficult obstacles for mothers who would prefer to return to work but whose children are young.
Better regional government utilization of demographic projections would allow for appropriate
planning of kindergarten facilities, including construction of new spaces or expansion of existing
facilities. Innovative approaches to building design and use, as well as regulatory reform, can
support the creation of more efficient multi-use facilities that can also enable the preschool
system to adapt to future demographic fluctuations. Increased support of alternative forms of
early childhood development centers, such as home-based groups under the care of a trained
parent and affiliated with an early childhood development (ECD) center and part-day education-
only groups in existing ECD centers and primary schools, could relieve the current excess demand
for quality childcare.
             5. Supporting Active Aging



          Greater utilization of older workers is essential to achievement of prosperous aging. As
          Russia faces the prospects of an aging and shrinking labor force, promotion of active aging, in
          which workers remain in productive employment for longer periods, can help Russia take full
          advantage of increased life expectancy. Both necessity and opportunity affect the decision to
          remain in the workforce past retirement age. In the late 1990s, low pensions and pension arrears
          were major reasons for pensioners to keep working and to work longer hours (Kolev and Pascal,
          2002; Gerber and Radl 2014). This discussion is based on more recent household survey data
          analysis from the RLMS, supplemented by reports from focus groups with employers and older
          employees/pensioners (Schwarz et al. 2014).

          Health is an important determinant of the decision to retire. For women, poor health is
          significantly related to that decision. For men, self-reported poor health is not, but chronic heart
          disease is (Figure 21). Similarly, an analysis of the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on
          Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) data found that employed older Russians have better
          performance on objective functional tests, such as walking est, and lower incidence of health

conditions, such as hypertension, coronary disease, stroke, and arthritis, than do their peers who
do not work (Maximova 2014). Finally, qualitative evidence from focus groups suggests that
health reasons are the leading cause of separation from employment for older workers, both at
their own initiative and at the initiative of employers.

Higher human capital enables Russians to lengthen their working life. In 2012, Russian
pensioners with university education were more likely to still be employed (with an increased
probability of employment of 4 pps for women and 13 pps for men). For men, secondary and
professional/vocational education are also associated with a higher probability of working past
retirement age. For older women, those with university education are 6 pps less likely to retire
in the next period than less-educated but otherwise similar women. Focus group evidence also
points to obsolete skills as a significant predictor of employer-initiated separation for older
workers and to a substantial skills mismatch in the labor market for Russian pensioners.

Russian couples greatly prefer to retire together. Having a working spouse was associated
with a statistically (and economically) significant 13 pp increase in the probability of being
employed for a pension-age husband and a smaller but still highly significant 9 pps increase for
a pension-age wife. Moreover, a partner’s decision to retire is correlated with a 7–8 pps higher
probability of retirement for the respondent.

Many older Russians keep working because they need the money. For people of pensionable
age, household income per capita (net of any labor income earned by the respondent) was 10
pps lower for working women and 7 pps lower for working men than for nonworking peers.
Income was also positively associated with exits from employment into retirement, although
these estimates are statistically somewhat less precise. In the focus groups, many older workers
reported necessity as the driving force for continued employment.

Flexible work arrangements and opportunities for professional growth matter for
retirement decisions. For older Russian women, the ability to work from home seems to be
correlated with delayed onset of retirement, perhaps due to the possibility of combining work
and fulfillment of care obligations. Indeed, in focus groups, flexible employment options (part-
time, seasonal, backup jobs) were cited as important factors that could persuade older workers
to stay in their current jobs after reaching retirement age. Older men who are dissatisfied with
their job (either ‘mostly’ or ‘absolutely’) are 5 pps more likely to be retired in a year’s time. For older
women, what matters is satisfaction with opportunities for professional growth – dissatisfied
women are 2 pps more likely to retire. This echoes the frustration reported by older Russians in
focus groups about the availability of only “nonprestigious,” unskilled routine jobs for pensioners,
which do not require them to use their skills or mental abilities. Indeed, 20.5 percent of those
aged 60–72 were working in the informal sector, according to Rosstat (2013) estimates; informal
jobs may offer the needed income support and flexibility but are likely to under-utilize pensioner
skills.

Social norms concerning the right to jobs may be pushing older Russians out of the labor
market. In many countries, including Russia, there is a widespread perception that older workers
are keeping younger ones from finding jobs. In the Generations and Gender Programme survey
conducted in 2004-08 in Russia, Russians were more likely to agree with the statement “When jobs
are scarce, younger people should have more right to a job than older people” than respondents
from most other countries.

Finally, negative employer attitudes toward older workers may present significant barriers
to their working longer. Although focus group results suggest that some Russian employers
perceive older workers to be more reliable and to have more positive work attitudes than
36                 Searching for a New ”Silver Age” in Russia: The Drivers and Impacts of Population Aging



     younger workers, the results also point to outdated perceptions of older workers’ diminishing
     physical and mental abilities and potential social tensions between younger and older workers.
     Moreover, focus group evidence indicates that individuals over 40–45 are not even considered
     by employers for competitive vacancies. This suggests a perception that older workers are less
     productive than younger colleagues when in reality what older workers lose in some skills, such
     as mental speed and physical strength, they gain in other capacities, such as verbal skills, social
     skills, and reliance on experience (Bussolo et al. 2015).

     Although Russia’s pension system does not explicitly discourage work, the official
     retirement age provides a very low anchor. Eligibility for receiving an old-age pension begins
     at 60 for men and 55 for women, and for receiving a social pension at 65 for men and 60 for
     women. Such relatively low eligibility ages are sometimes justified by low life expectancies (as
     of 2011) of 64 for males and 76 for females. However, the more relevant life expectancy indicator
     for pension-related issues is measured not at birth but at the age of retirement. Based on the
     actuarial forecast of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, in 2010 average life expectancy
     was 14.3 years for 60-year-old men and 23.9 years for 55-year-old women. This implies that the
     expected duration of pension receipt in Russia is below the OECD average for men (17 years), but
     significantly above the OECD average for women (20.3 years; OECD 2011). Moreover, a substantial
     share of older workers (e.g., those working in hazardous or difficult conditions, and teachers and
     health care workers with sufficient years of service) are eligible to receive pension benefits before
     the already-low eligibility ages. About 35 percent of individuals start drawing pensions before
     the standard pensionable age, and 30 percent of women and 20 percent of men are already
     claiming pensions by the time they are 50 (OECD 2011).

     However, many Russians continue working beyond the statutory retirement age. Given
     that pension benefits have historically been low (although benefits have increased substantially
     since 2008), and that there is no income test for the receipt of pension benefits, many Russians
     continue to work past the eligibility age. Indeed, the effective age at labor force exit is 63.3 for
     men and 60 for women, though that is still below the OECD average by 0.9 years for men and
     3 years for women (Figure 22). The male average effective retirement age has been converging
     to the OECD benchmark since 1997, but the female average lags far behind. Moreover, the
     near-universal claiming of pension benefits at the official retirement age has strained the fiscal
     sustainability of the system.

     The recent pension reform improved the incentives to extend working life and defer
     pension receipt. While the reform, which went into effect in 2015, did not change the pension
     eligibility age, it extended the mandatory contribution period to 15 years (gradually increasing
Overview Report                                                                                                                37



from the current 5 years over 2015–25), added the criterion of accumulating at least 30 individual
pension points (based on contributions), and provided for quite substantial increases in pension
benefits if the individual continues to work past retirement age. However, the details of the
transition from a notional defined contribution to a point-based pension system are not yet clear,
making it difficult for individuals to plan their retirement decisions. In this uncertain environment,
many people may still find it attractive to claim pension benefits as early as possible. The
numerous changes in the pension rules over the last 20 years have added to the predisposition
for myopic behavior.

Part-time work and flexible work arrangements are few, which may deter the LFP of older
adults. According to the Labor Code, part-time workers preserve all the rights of full-time workers.
However, according to Rosstat estimates, only about 5 percent of workers in 2012 worked less
than 30 hours a week. While 21 percent of women and 12 percent of men aged 60–72 worked
part-time, according to Eurostat online database, this is far below the EU average of 52 percent
for men and 67 percent for women aged 65 years or more. Earlier studies suggest that part-time
employment is only taken up by people who cannot obtain full-time positions (Tchetvernina et
al. 2001 as cited in Cazes and Nesporova 2003). Whether this is still the case, and whether there
is a difference in the value workers of different ages attribute to part-time employment, is an
important subject for future research.

The government is making a concerted effort to bring the disabled into the labor market.
Disability pension is paid in full irrespective of employment, and contributions to the Pension
Fund during employment of the disabled individual are taken into account when calculating
the size of the disability pension. Although there are some restrictions on the amount of hours
that can be worked each week, the Labor Code requires full payment for reduced hours of work,
which may discourage hiring. On the other hand, the disabled have priority access to retraining
and special job creation programs; firms with more than 100 employees have quotas for hiring
the disabled; and firms that employ the disabled are eligible for subsidies on profit and payroll
taxes and accidental insurance premiums (although claiming these subsidies apparently is
complicated and time-consuming). The share of disability pensioners in employment increased
from 22.5 percent in 2006 to 31.6 percent in 2011 (Table 5).

There is significant scope for Russia to increase the LFP of women and the elderly. Female
LFP is significantly below that of males during the peak childbearing years (mid-20s through the
30s) and after women’s statutory retirement age of 55 years (Figure 23A). Policies to improve the
tradeoff between family and work could increase the LFP of younger women while adjusting
the ages for pension eligibility could do the same for older women. Some appreciation of the
potential for raising LFP rates can be gained by comparing Russian experience with that of other
countries. The extreme example is Iceland, which has the highest LFP rate in Europe; in 2010,

              74.5 percent of its adult population (aged 15+) were in the labor force, compared to 63 percent
              in Russia. A large part of this difference is due to the higher LFP of 50+-year-olds (Figure 23B).
              While 40 percent of men and about 25 percent of women in Russia are active past 60, in Iceland
              these figures are 85 percent for men and 73 percent for women. Thus, at least in principle, there
              appears to be substantial scope to lengthen Russian working lives. However, attaining such high
              LFP rates would only be possible if many other constraints, such as those affecting health, skills,
              and mobility, are removed.

              Promotion of healthier lifestyles, coupled with a focus on preventive medicine and early
              diagnosis, can help Russian workers work longer and live more satisfying lives. Nearly 94
              percent of men and 85 percent of women aged 50–79 smoke, get insufficient exercise, or do
              not eat sufficient fruits and vegetables (Figure 24), and nearly 8 percent of adults 50 and older
              drink excessively. Maximova (2014) also identifies several conditions, such as angina, asthma,

and depression, for which self-reports of older Russians in the SAGE survey are significantly lower
than symptom-based prevalence estimates – underlining the importance of raising awareness of
these diseases and their symptoms.

Encouraging firms to institute age management policies for older workers can prolong
their working lives and improve productivity. Older workers can be as productive as younger
workers with workplace adjustments that compensate for reduced physical capacity, and mixed-
age teams can improve the productivity of both older and younger workers (Bussolo et al. 2015).
In Russia, extending working lives can generate substantial benefits, given that half of adults aged
50 and above have higher education and another 30 percent have professional or vocational
education. It is also likely to be feasible, according to the 2012 RLMS data: most older workers are
employed in the services sector, where the physical demands are often less onerous than in other
sectors. Current initiatives to encourage workplace adjustments for disabled individuals could
be supplemented with information on, and promotion of, less costly adaptations to an aging
workforce, especially in sectors that have seen their shares of older employees rising.

Equalizing the pensionable ages for men and women can extend working lives and improve
the horizontal equity of Russia’s pension system. Lower life expectancy of men combined
with a later pensionable age results in a 10-year gender gap in life expectancy at retirement
(OECD 2011b). Since the current insurance pension formula does not adjust pension benefits by
the expected duration of payments,11 the pension payouts for men are likely to be lower than
those for women. Moreover, raising the female statutory pensionable age to equal that of men
could extend working lives for both genders, given the preference of Russian couples for retiring
together.

Discouraging early retirement of able-bodied Russians by raising the pensionable age,
adjusting pension benefits, and shifting the fiscal burden from the state to employers can
promote longer working lives and better working conditions. The long lists of occupations
that are eligible for early retirement can be revised by studying current working conditions and
the average age and health at retirement in each occupation (many individuals continue to work
in the same job under onerous conditions while receiving early retirement benefits). Moreover,
internalization of the costs of early pension payouts could be strengthened; the 2013 pension
reform already shifted some of the costs onto employers in eligible occupations by introducing
additional payroll tax rates of 2 to 8 percent. One option is to tie the magnitude of the tax to the
past uptake of early retirement pensions in a way that holds employers more accountable for
providing safer working conditions.

Increasing transparency in the social insurance system is crucial to ensure the effectiveness
of built-in system incentives. As with any complex reform, issues of credibility and the quality
of implementation can be as important as design features in determining the impact of
changes. Uncertainty about the value of a pension point in determining the magnitude of the
pension benefit can dampen motivation to follow the direction of incentives and can result in a
preference for smaller but certain payoffs rather than larger but uncertain ones. It is important
that the government determine a clear, and even more importantly predictable, strategy for
valuing pension points. A broad-based information and communication campaign to elucidate
the objectives and design features of the new pension system could be followed by collaboration
with social workers, regional branches of the Pension Fund, and organizations helping pensioners
and individuals of pre-pension age to make work and retirement decisions.

424 “On funded pensions”).
6. The Role of Adult Education



Knowledge is critical for sustaining competitiveness and economic growth in today’s
globalized economy. The key to prosperity for Russia is a well-educated, technically skilled
workforce, employed by firms that have the managerial capacity to adopt up-to-date technology
and sell sophisticated goods and services in local and global markets. To ensure continued
competitiveness, the education system must enable workers to upgrade their skills throughout
their working lives. The share of output produced by performance of routine tasks has declined
in most OECD countries (Autor et al. 2003), and a similar trend is already observed in emerging
European economies (Arias et al. 2014). Inculcating the skills demanded by a knowledge-based
economy requires emphasis on inquiry-based learning and the adaptation of teaching to the
learning capacity of individual students.

Promotion of social inclusion through adult education can improve the well-being of
Russia’s citizens and mitigate the impact of aging on growth. Population aging and the
growing ranks of low-skilled migrant workers are increasing the importance of adult education
and continuous learning. The model of “one-shot” education, where most who finish one level of
education without meeting the requirements for the next level are expected to join the workforce,
is being replaced by a new emphasis on lifelong learning, in which secondary, higher, and
vocational education are increasingly expected to respond to the exigencies of competitiveness.

The skills gap in Russia’s workforce is increasing as students progress through the education
system and widens further as they enter the labor market (Figure 25). The development of
basic cognitive skills (literacy and numeracy) in students is adequate in primary education, and
in 2006 Russia was ranked as the top global performer in reading achievement according to the
Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) survey. However, the quality of secondary
education is still not sufficient given the demands of innovation-based economy. While the PISA
standardized tests show that the reading, math, and science levels in Russia are higher than in
other countries of similar per capita income, they are significantly below the OECD average.

In contrast to other countries, there is no strong age gradient to basic cognitive skills in
Russia. While the oldest have lower levels of literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than
younger working-age groups (Figure 26), the negative relationship between skills and age is
not strongly monotonic, as is common in other countries (see, e.g., the example of Poland in
Figure 27). Rather than age-related effects, this likely reflects the impact of the drastic changes
in Russian education and the labor market on particular cohorts. In particular, the relatively
high performance of Russians in their 40s could reflect secondary or post-secondary education
in the 1980s, when there was an emphasis on generic problem-solving abilities – practical and
theoretical – across all fields. On the other hand, the skill set of the group aged 30–34, who had
been in secondary education during perestroika and the formation of a new Russian state, may
have been negatively influenced by the country’s transformation. Whatever the cause, programs
targeted to relatively low-performing cohorts may be warranted.

Russian adults do poorly on on-the-job learning and use of information and communications
technology (ICT). Learning at work, whether through training, peer-to-peer, observation, or
encouragement of management to engage in improving production and processes, is closely
correlated with productivity gains and innovation. Russian prime-aged and older adults perform
poorly compared to those in OECD countries in learning at work and in the use of ICT at home and
in the workplace, according to the PIAAC tests. Lower usage of ICT can lead to lower productivity
and less opportunity for self-learning through distance technologies.

Population aging underlines the importance of adult education in supporting employability
and heightened productivity for every able-bodied individual. To enable longer working
lives as life expectancy improves, it will be necessary to adapt the education system at all levels.
The benefits of improving the quality of formal education will only be clear in the medium term
as students in the reformed system work their way up the age pyramid. On the other hand, a
broad-based and effective system of adult education, including skills upgrading and retraining,
can provide second-chance opportunities to enhanced productivity and attain a longer working
life for current workers, thus reaping more immediate payoffs. Moreover, how effectively labor
market or social protection reforms affect the LFP of older Russians depends critically on whether
these adults are employable – something that can be achieved through targeted programs of
adult education.

     Relatively few Russians participate in adult education, although the composition of those
     who do is shifting. The limited data available show that 27.3 percent of Russian adults are
     engaged in some form of adult education (Indicators of Education 2013) – up from 22.4 percent
     in 2006 but still well below several Eastern European countries (Figure 28). Similarly, the share of
     adults involved in continuous professional education (CPE) is low compared to OECD countries.
     Although the share of the working-age population in formal education fell from 4.5 percent in
     2006 to 2.7 percent in 2012, the share of those in CPE rose from 8.0 percent in 2006 to 13.5
     percent in 2012. Meanwhile, the share of people who opt for self-education increased from 17.4
     percent in 2006 to 24.4 percent in 2012, due to the development of online education, which is
     especially important given Russia’s vast territory.

     Access to CPE varies considerably. Participation in CPE varied from 11 to 16 percent of adult
     workers by region (Rosstat 2013). The rate of participation declines steeply as workers reach
     pre-retirement years, while the highest participation rate is found among workers aged 25–39
     years (Figure 29). Thus, while younger and older workers may need more training to become
     or remain productive, they currently benefit the least from CPE (Figure 30). Low-skilled workers
     are least likely to obtain professional education (Higher School of Economics 2012), which may
     impede the growth of the knowledge-based economy and perpetuate earnings inequality
     and low social mobility. While most CPE participants are employed in either manufacturing (24
     percent), education (19 percent), or health and social services (13 percent), the mining sector has
     the highest share of its employees participating in CPE (26 percent), followed by transport and
     communication, utilities and manufacturing. Employees in retail trade, agriculture, fishing, and
     hotels/restaurants had the lowest participation rates (less than 5 percent in each sector). About
     90 percent of all CPE participants received training in their own specialization (professional
     development), and only 10 percent participated in retraining. Finally, most of the training
     programs were relatively short (9–37 days).

The adult education market is robust and expanding. The number and types of providers,
as well as the variety of products, have gone up significantly. Some 2,000 institutions have CPE
programs, perhaps 3,000 if short-term (less than 9 days) and in-house programs are included
(Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation 2009). An expansion in coverage
and enrollment was accompanied by a doubling of public spending from 2000 to 2005.

Several successful regional models of adult education have emerged, and more attention
is being paid to education targeted to socially vulnerable groups. The provision of CPE varies
widely by region, depending on socioeconomic and labor market conditions, the human resource
base, and demand. Among successful models are Tatarstan’s focus on high-quality, specialist
training to support petrochemical and refinery companies, which integrates the efforts of a variety
of public and private stakeholders, and Kaluga’s use of partnerships with international investors.
There has been active development of education targeted to socially vulnerable categories of
people, including the elderly, the unemployed, migrants, and individuals demobilized from the
Armed Forces. Recently, across Russia there has been a flurry of new educational programs for the
elderly, including innovative forms of learning, which suggests there is active demand from older
people to participate in the educational process. There is also robust development of training
for the unemployed, with more than 3,000 professional educational institutions engaged on
contract for such active labor market programs. Moreover, given the high numbers of migrants
from Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) residing in Russia, there have been several
initiatives to enhance their integration, such as the initiative to create a common educational
space for CIS members.

The adult education system suffers from several deficiencies that deter expansion of
coverage and greater effectiveness. Currently, adult education in Russia lacks a regulatory
framework, a financing strategy, a system for training providers, and the ability to evaluate
individual programs or the aggregate impact on social and economic objectives. Information
on training opportunities is limited, especially for small employers and their employees. And
the system is still based on traditional pedagogical principles that do not reflect recent research
on how mature brains learn differently from developing brains (Johnson and Taylor 2006 and
Maestas and Zissimopoulos 2010 cited in Schwarz et al. 2014).
44            Searching for a New ”Silver Age” in Russia: The Drivers and Impacts of Population Aging


     Russia lacks a comprehensive policy framework for adult education. Such a framework
     should be flexible, provide for adequate financing, and include the clear occupational standards,
     accreditation and quality assurance systems, and certification and equivalence systems required
     to encourage quality provision. A federal law “On Adult Education” should be considered to
     establish the legal framework for the adult education system. The law could provide for funding
     from the state budget and cooperative financing arrangements with the private sector, a legal
     framework for the involvement of educational institutions in adult education, and be congruent
     with the legislative acts of other countries. Regulations could expand on these provisions,
     including setting up the organizational structure for adult education; ensuring emphasis on
     demand-driven approaches with monitoring of educational services markets; providing for
     research (including data collection), marketing and outreach; and promotion of distance learning.
     Work is required to frame appropriate methodology for adult education. Effective adult
     education is based on adult learning theory, andragogy, the concept of free or open adult learning,
     reflecting a continuing learning throughout a person’s life. Andragogical models of learning use
     learning and teaching materials created specifically for adults, taking into account new insights
     from neuroscience about aging brains and their social and psychological characteristics. For
     example, at least two studies have shown that there are greater gains for older adults when
     performing procedural (hands-on) activities compared to conceptual training (Mead and Fisk
     1998 and Mead et al. 1997 cited in Charness and Czaja 2006).
     The legal framework should set standards for training providers. To ensure quality in
     adult education, legal provisions can be drafted that describe the responsibilities of specialists
     engaged in adult education, such as teachers, consultants, tutors, administrators and
     managers, employees of information and orientation services, social workers, and employees
     of rehabilitation correctional institutions. Teacher training for adult educators and trainers could
     entail systematic retraining and professional development training, as well as postgraduate
     education for andragogy specialists of different directions and levels.

     Awareness campaigns and financial incentives could raise demand for adult education.
     Regular public and social events could promote the ideas of adult education, continuing learning,
     and continuous personal improvement throughout life. A greater role for government (federal,
     state, and local), private companies, and public organizations and individuals conducting social
     and public activities can help build up adult education in Russia, through e.g., social partnerships.
     Individual demand can also be stimulated through financial incentives, such as tax credits or paid
     education leave from employment, in combination with study loans/grants or vouchers (UNESCO
     Institute for Lifelong Learning 2009). Eligibility for these incentives could be universal or targeted
     to specific groups that are under-represented in adult education, as is done in Sweden. Demand-
     oriented incentives, such as the training vouchers given out in Austria and Germany, motivate
     individuals to be active consumers and create competition among providers (UNESCO Institute
     for Lifelong Learning 2009).

     Government should encourage greater private sector participation in adult education.
     Experience in many countries suggests that public-private partnerships can make adult education
     more effective. Employer associations can identify professional qualification standards that meet
     the needs of their specific labor market. The state can engage employers in monitoring the
     quality of educational services and in the formation and approval of qualification requirements
     (professional competencies), so that training is more adapted to firm needs. The government has
     adopted a plan for developing 800 professional standards. For small and medium enterprises,
     government can facilitate investment in training by creating an infrastructure for industry-wide
     training programs, as is done in Italy and Australia, and by offering co-financing arrangements
     (UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning 2009). Another option is to follow the example of France
     or Hungary and impose a training levy, which can be used for a national training fund or to
     finance training for contributing firms (UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning 2009).
  7. Conclusion



There is no time to lose. Policy reforms to increase productivity and labor force participation,
raise government savings, ease the tradeoff women face between work and family, improve
health care services and lifestyle choices, and establish a modern and more comprehensive adult
education system could help avoid the potentially negative implications of population aging
for growth and welfare. But policy changes are urgent if they are to have an appreciable impact
within the next several decades. For example, the transition from an unfunded to a funded
pension system becomes more costly, and more politically difficult, as the elderly dependency
ratio rises. Moreover, many lifestyle decisions take considerable time to have an impact. For
example, it takes 18 years for increases in fertility to raise the size of the labor force. And decisions
by today’s young workers to cut smoking and alcohol consumption may be necessary to ensure
healthier lives by elderly workers in 30 to 40 years. As emphasized in the introduction, population
aging may not greatly change the nature of policies that will improve welfare, but it does lend
urgency to the reform agenda.

There is nothing to fear but inaction. Population aging is neither an uncontrollable disaster nor
a problem that will solve itself. Aging can be consistent with longer, more prosperous, and more
satisfying lives, but that is not inevitable. Changes in individual and firm behavior in response to
market forces are necessary to address the challenges of aging. However, only the government
can modify the structure of incentives and institutions to encourage longer working lives, higher
fertility, and improved productivity. It is hoped that the Russian government will undertake the
difficult reforms that are necessary to achieve these goals.

There is still much to learn. This publication has benefited enormously from advances in
research and the development of data sources, particularly efforts to improve the coverage
of surveys. Nevertheless, information is lacking or insufficient on issues that are critical for
understanding the impact of aging, for example, evaluations of family support services, detailed
demographic data (including the distribution of newborns by birth order, number of children in
divorced families, and data on parents who marry and separate), and information on the extent
and effectiveness of adult education programs. Moreover, as stated in the beginning, some areas
of the multi-faceted and cross-cutting aging agenda, such as, inter alia, healthcare reform and
migration policy, were not covered in this volume, and deserve to be studied in the future with
the same demographic lens as was adopted here.
