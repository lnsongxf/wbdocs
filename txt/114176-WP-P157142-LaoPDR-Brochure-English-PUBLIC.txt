In recent years, Lao PDR has made significant development advances. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged
                                                                                                                                     TOP PRIORITIES
7.8 percent per year over the past decade, making Lao PDR the 13th fastest-growing economy globally. Incomes rose,
poverty declined, and access to some basic services, including education, health, and infrastructure, improved considerably.

However, the increase in incomes for most of the population was not commensurate to the GDP growth. Growth was
driven by natural resources with limited job creation. Agriculture employed most of the workforce, and productivity
was stagnant. Loss of revenue and weak public financial management also prevented sharing benefits of growth.
                                                                                                                                    Promoting strategic use of natural       Increasing agricultural productivity to     Investing in improving nutrition to

Malnutrition continues to be high, and the risk of falling into poverty is a reality for a large part of the population.
Growing public debt burden, systemic risks in the financial sector, and low reserve buffers may test macroeconomic
stability which can ignite inflation, lower living standards, and hurt public services delivery. Continued environmental
degradation and climate change will also pose challenges.

Strengthening institutions will be key to progress. This should include improving institutions to manage
macroeconomic volatility, strengthening accountability of service providers, and ensuring a level-playing field to
promote competition.


Agricultural productivity lags behind other countries in the region, so this area has great potential. Strategic and
responsible use of natural resources is also critical to growth and livelihoods. Improving nutrition should be a
top priority, as 44 percent of under-five-year-olds were stunted in 2012. More and better education can improve
agriculture and prepare people for the transition toward non-farm jobs. Finally, addressing risks in the fiscal and
financial sectors will ensure stability of growth and public services.
