Box 1: Mainstreaming Governance in the WBG Program

The focus on governance across the WBG program entails a combination of project, sector,
and country-level approaches:

•	 During project preparation and implementation, the WBG works with country counterparts
   and partners to consider how a project might help advance governance (institutional
   capacity, transparency, accountability, participation, and anti-corruption) in Myanmar, and
   how governance risks may affect the achievement of project development objectives and
   how to mitigate them. There is no presumption that a project should address a particular
   governance issue, rather the key is the systematic consideration of governance issues
   during preparation and their monitoring during implementation.

•	 At the sector level, the WBG integrates governance considerations in its strategic
   engagement. This includes the identification of key governance issues affecting sectors or
   sub-sectors to inform not only project design but also policy dialogue.  Where feasible, the
   WBG supports priority activities aimed at addressing these challenges as part of its overall
   support to the sector, as is the case for example with the WBG’s support to EITI in the area
   of energy and extractives.

•	 At the country level, the WBG will regularly review experiences, including successes and
   constraints, in governance mainstreaming, and adjust course as necessary in its knowledge
   and financing work, including through the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and the
   CPF’s Performance and Learning Review.

     Expanding Access to Finance
     Program Overview
     As the private sector investment arm of the World Bank Group, IFC
     in Myanmar seeks to enhance financial inclusion by focusing on the
     following three areas: (i) microfinance – developing a full menu of
     products and services for micro-entrepreneurs, small business owners,
     and farmers; (ii) banking – improving the capacity of banks to serve
     SMEs; and (iii) financial infrastructure – building the foundations to
     support credit expansion by enabling the regulatory environment for
     credit bureaus, training the Supervisors of the Central Bank Officials,
     and sharing Credit Reporting knowledge to stakeholders.
