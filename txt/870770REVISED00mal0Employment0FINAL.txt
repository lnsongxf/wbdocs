Abstract: This report has been written for developing countries' policy makers and individuals
in the development community who are actively engaged in efforts to achieve universal health
coverage (UHC). The aim of the report is to review existing approaches and available policy
options to improve access to health care services and financial protection against health shocks
for informal-sector workers (ISWs). Along with their families, ISWs represent the majority of the
population in many developing countries. The report reviews the definition and measurement of
the informal sector and the literature on efforts toward its health insurance coverage. It also
examines several country cases based on published and unpublished reports and on structured
interviews of expert informants. Developing country efforts to expand health coverage are
characterized by a common enrollment and financing pattern, starting with formal-sector workers
and following with government-subsidized enrollment of the poor. Thus, ISWs are typically left
behind and have been referred to as “the missing middle.” They find themselves financially
unprotected against health shocks and with limited access to quality and timely health care. ISWs
are generally reluctant to enroll in insurance schemes, including social health insurance (SHI),
community insurance, and other arrangements. Further, initiatives to enroll them in self-financed
contributory schemes have generally resulted in adverse selection, as those with high anticipated
health needs are more willing to pay and enroll than others, thus threatening the schemes’
financial viability. Successful initiatives to cover this population group are the ones where
government has abandoned its expectations to derive relatively substantial revenue from it.
Offering this group a benefits package that is relatively smaller than that of formal workers and
charging them a premium that is only a fraction of that charged to formal workers is a strategy
used by some countries to limit the need for public subsidies. Switching from SHI to a tax-
financed system is an alternative strategy adopted by others. While there is evidence that greater
insurance coverage has improved access to health services for ISWs and their dependents, in
several countries it has not yet improved financial protection for this target group. A broad set of
reforms will be required to strengthen the supply side to ensure that additional public financing
translates into improved coverage for ISWs. Finally, large and sustained economic growth is
indispensable to achieve UHC, as it creates the public resources to subsidize coverage for the
poor and ISWs.

                                            I. INTRODUCTION

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) has long been a social aspiration of most nations and
is currently a top health policy priority around the developing world. Low- and middle-income
countries as diverse as Ghana, Peru, and Vietnam are striving to expand health insurance
coverage for their populations. Upper-middle-income nations, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, and
Thailand have already claimed success.

The quest for UHC has also been promoted by international development organizations, which
have recently embraced UHC. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO)
has stated that UHC “is the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer.” The
World Health Report 2010 focused exclusively on this question (World Health Organization
2010). The influential journal The Lancet in 2012 devoted a full issue to UHC.

There is no single definition of UHC, but available definitions overlap in that UHC involves the
extension of health insurance to all citizens, improves accessibility to needed health services by
all, and provides financial protection against the costs of health shocks (Cotlear 2012). There is
therefore some room for interpretation of the concept of UHC, particularly as regards the breadth
of the benefits package delivered by the insurer, but also in relation to the extent of financial
coverage conferred by the health system.

Efforts to achieve UHC are characterized by increasing needs for public financing. For example,
in Colombia, total health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) increased
considerably following the 1994 reform to achieve UHC — from 7.4 percent in 1995 to close to
10.0 percent in 1997. Vietnam, which set out to achieve UHC in 1993, experienced a four-fold
increase in real per capita total health expenditure between 1995 and 2009. In Ghana, the
implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme in late 2005 led to a significant
expansion in total health expenditure as a share of GDP, reaching 10.6 percent in 2007 (Bitrán
2012b).

The additional revenue required by UHC poses a challenge to governments. Relying on user
payments to bridge financing gaps in public financing is not an advisable option. While user fees
raise revenue to improve health workers’ pay and quality of care, they may deter access,
particularly for the poor, and thereby render UHC infeasible. Implementing effective systems of
waivers for the poor has been shown to be administratively very difficult in low-income settings,
and therefore a system of charging user fees selectively to the nonpoor is hard to implement
(Bitrán and Giedion 2003). Additional public revenue for health is essential, and may be obtained
from reallocations to the health sector away from other sectors or from additional revenue. 1
Where additional revenue sources are required, governments may increase taxes or, in countries
that have social health insurance (SHI), they may raise extra revenue from social security
contributions (International Labour Organization 2008).

1. Countries may also borrow domestically or internationally to finance coverage expansion, but eventually they will
require own public resources to repay any such loans. In theory, countries may also achieve gains in the efficiency of
government health spending, although in practice, such gains are hard to materialize and unlikely to be of a
meaningful magnitude to finance coverage expansion efforts.



                                                          1
Irrespective of the intended source of additional public funding — general taxes or SHI
contributions — developing countries face the formidable challenge of raising the needed extra
revenue in a scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the informal sector
of the economy. Informal sector workers are individuals who lack a work contract and who tend
not to belong, or contribute, to SHI. These individuals may also evade income taxes as national
and local tax institutions may be unable to assess, and therefore tax, their incomes.

There is a statistical negative relationship between GDP per capita and informal employment
(International Labour Organization 2011): richer countries tend to have a smaller proportion of
informality than poorer ones, suggesting that over the long term, as countries become richer, their
informal employment will fall (see figure 1). Yet over the next few decades, most developing
countries will continue to face the problem of a large informal sector and the associated limited
ability to raise public revenue from income- and labor-related taxes. Further, informal
employment not only accounts for the majority of all employment in developing countries, but in
many countries its numbers have been growing. In this context, the kinds of health coverage
improvements that countries will be able to afford will be limited by available public resources.
When they achieve, or claim that they have achieved, UHC will depend on their efforts to expend
public financing for health and on their each country’s own definition of such a concept.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the internationally
accepted definition of informal employment. Section 3 reviews statistics from the developing
world about informal employment, assesses their economic significance, examines evidence
about the income of informal sector workers, and presents possible causes of informality. Section
4 is a review of the published and unpublished literature on the challenges of and strategies for
providing health insurance for those employed in the informal sector and their families. Section 5
documents the efforts of several countries to cover the informally employed. The first half of
section 5 presents eight country cases and thematic reviews drawn exclusively from the published
and unpublished literature. These include a review of previous studies of insurance for informal
sector workers, studies of community-based health insurance (CBHI) in Africa, CBHI in India,
government-sponsored health insurance schemes (GSHIS) in India, and health insurance reform
in China, Korea, and Indonesia. The second half of section 5 presents an additional eight country
cases covering three regions of the developing world to illustrate additional policy approaches
and results related to the provision of health coverage for informal sector workers and their

expert country informants, with supplemental information from the literature. Section 6 offers

                             2.1.   DEFINITION OF INFORMAL SECTOR

The informal sector has been defined in various ways. This paper uses the definition adopted by
the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1993 to measure the size and scope of the
informal sector in all countries around the world (Fifteenth International Conference of Labour
Statisticians 1993). It states that the informal sector is composed of entities engaged in the
production of goods or services with the main objective of generating employment and income.
These entities tend to operate at a low level of organization, with little or no division between
labor and capital, and on a small scale. Labor relations are based mostly on casual employment,
kinship, or personal and social relations, not on contractual arrangements with formal guarantees.

According to the ILO, informal sector production units have the following characteristic features
of household enterprises: (a) fixed and other assets used do not belong to the production units but
to their owners; (b) units cannot engage in transactions or contracts with other units, nor incur
liabilities, on their own behalf; (c) owners must raise needed financing at their own risk and are
personally liable, without limit, for any debts; (d) expenditure for production is often
indistinguishable from household expenditure; and (e) capital goods (buildings, vehicles, and so
forth) may be used indistinguishably for business and household purposes.

Informal sector entities do not necessarily function deliberately to evade payment of taxes or
social security contributions, or infringe on labor or other legislation or administrative provisions.
Informal sector activities should be distinguished from the concept of activities of the hidden or
underground economy.

The existence of an informal sector limits the local tax authority’s ability to collect revenue.
Cobham estimated that, around 2005, developing countries’ tax revenue foregone from the


                                                  3
informal economy, including both corporate income taxes from unregistered firms and personal
income taxes from informal employment, amounted annually to about US$285 billion,
representing 31percent of all potential tax revenue in developing countries. In addition, there was
other tax revenue foregone, including US$50 billion from offshore asset holding, and another
US$50 billion from corporate profit shifting (Cobham 2005; GTZ 2010), for a total of US$385
billion.

In most developing countries, the informal sector plays a significant role in employment and
income generation, and in economic and social development. Knowledge about the informal
sector’s size and scope is indispensable for national policy makers, since this may help them
design and monitor specific support policies and assistance programs for the informal sector to
increase the productive potential and employment- and income-generating capacity of informal
sector units; improve the working conditions and social and legal protection of informal sector
workers; develop an appropriate regulatory framework and promote the organization of informal
sector producers and workers; and analyze the economic and social situation of particular groups
of informal sector workers, such as women, children, rural-urban migrants, and immigrants.

In developing countries, the agricultural sector accounts for a large share of total employment
(see figure 2). By convention, the measurement of employment in the informal sector excludes
the agricultural sector.

According to the ILO, the informal economy refers to all informal employment in a country or
region. It has two components: (1) employment in the informal sector as defined by the Fifteenth
International Conference on Labor Statisticians, and (2) other forms of informal employment
(that is, informal employment outside the informal sector, including in formal sector firms and
households) (International Labour Organization 2002). In much of the literature, and in this
report, the following are synonyms: informality, informal economy, and informal employment.
Figure 3 illustrates these concepts.

To sum up, employment in the informal sector is an enterprise-based concept, which is defined as
jobs in unregistered or small, unincorporated private enterprises. Such enterprises are not
constituted as separate legal entities (thus are not officially registered) and do not maintain a
complete set of accounts. The majority of employment in the informal sector is informal
employment, but there may be some formal employment as well.

Informal employment is a job-based concept and encompasses those jobs that generally lack
basic social or legal protections or employment benefits; however, such jobs may be found in the
formal sector, informal sector, or in households.

                        III. SIZE AND SCOPE OF INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT
Charmes (2012) analyzed trends in informal employment in five-year periods over the last four
decades. He cautioned the reader that his analysis was based on nonagricultural employment
only, using various procedures and sources of data over time; different sets of countries were
included in each region of the world in each study period. Overall, he found that in four of the six
regions of the developing world, informal employment grew over time (figure 4); it remained
stable in Western Asia but fell in Sub-Saharan Africa between the mid-to-late 1990s and the mid-
to-late 2000s.

In Northern Africa, informal employment grew significantly over the entire period, although it
had intermediate fluctuations. Charmes noted that estimates for this region of the world were the
most numerous over the four decades, and that the trend illustrates the countercyclical behavior
of informal employment: it increases when the rate of economic growth is decelerating, and
contracts when the rate of growth increases.

Former Soviet-style economies that are transitioning to more free market–oriented systems have
experienced an increase in informal employment because the shrinking of government-based jobs
has not been offset by growth in formal, private employment.

The notable drop in informal employment in Sub-Saharan Africa may be attributable to the high
rate of economic growth of 4.6 percent per year in the most recent decade, compared with lower
growth in the past, when informal employment was on the increase.


                                                                 6
In Latin America, informal employment seems on the rise, increasing from 54.2 percent at the
end of the 1990s to 57.7 percent at the end of the 2000s, even if this trend could be decelerating
in the last period: most countries for which an estimate is available for the first half of the 2000s
have seen employment in the informal economy decrease in the second half (except Mexico and
Peru).

Charmes (2012) also examined the share of informal employment coming from within and
outside the informal sector. He found that in four of the six regions of the developing world under
study, the majority of informal employment came from outside the informal sector, that is, from
formal sector firms and from households. In Northern Africa, Latin America, and Western Asia
about two-thirds of informal employment came from formal sector firms and households (figure
5). In transition countries, a mere 11 percent of informal employment came from the informal
sector, and 89 percent came from outside of it. Only in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and
Southeastern Asia did the share of informal employment originating in the informal sector exceed
that coming from outside the informal sector.

A 2011 ILO report provided statistics on informal employment from 47 low- and medium-
income countries (International Labour Organization 2011). It found that in 15 countries,
informal employment accounted for more than two-thirds of total nonagricultural employment;
Central and Eastern European countries featured the lowest proportion of informal employment;
in all but two countries, the bulk of informal employment was concentrated in the informal
sector; in 30 of the 41 countries with data disaggregated by gender, the proportion of women in

informal employment exceeded that of men; in the largest developing countries, the percentage of
women in informal employment in manufacturing activities was usually much higher than that of
men; 2 and cross-country data suggested that informal employment was paired with low-income
per capita and high poverty rates.

India, the share of women with informal employment in the manufacturing sector reaches 94 percent.

                           3.1. ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT

As already noted, the relatively high contribution of the agricultural sector to employment in
developing countries, and the high share of informal employment in that sector, makes it
advisable to examine trends in informal employment outside of agriculture. For the same reason
it is useful to examine the contribution of the informal sector to GDP outside of the agricultural
sector. The figures below present this information for selected countries from two contrasting
regions of the developing world, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

In Latin America, the informal sector’s contribution to nonagricultural GDP varies from a low of
16 percent in Venezuela to a high of 30 percent in Colombia and Guatemala. The relatively small
economic significance of the agricultural sector in most of these countries (compared with Sub-
Saharan Africa) implies that the informal sector’s contribution to GDP does not change much
whether the agricultural sector is included or excluded from it. An exception is Honduras, where
about one-third of the informal sector’s output comes from agriculture; excluding the agricultural
sector reduces the informal sector’s contribution to GDP from 24.3 percent to 16.0 percent.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the contribution of the informal sector to nonagricultural GDP varies
from a low of 22 percent in Burkina Faso to a high of 36 percent in Cameroon. In this region, the
agricultural sector accounts for a much larger share of total GDP; therefore the share of informal
sector GDP from agriculture is relatively large in all countries.


                                         3.2.           INCOME OF INFORMAL SECTOR WORKERS

Bargain and Kwenda (2009) examined the existence of the wage gap, or so-called “informal
wage penalty,” a phenomenon by which informal sector workers would receive lower after-tax
wages than equivalent formally employed workers. In their empirical work they used quantile
regressions and large panel datasets from Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico to estimate the wage
gap between informal and formal salary workers, accounting for taxes paid in formal
employment and for differences in workers’ age and education levels. They found that younger
workers face larger penalties, especially in Brazil and South Africa (figure 7), a result that is in
line with previous research. Education levels seem to affect the wage gap only at the two
extremes of the distribution.

At the top, the informal wage penalty is smaller in all countries — and even turns into a premium
in Brazil — for those with higher education. This could be similarity of characteristics between
the top informal workers and their formal sector counterparts. In the lower part of the
distribution, a larger penalty is observed for high education groups in Brazil and Mexico. This
possibly reflects that education has a higher return in the formal sector, either because it acts as a
signaling device or because this sector is capital-intensive and pays high rewards for
complementing capital inputs.

                              3.3.    THE CAUSES OF INFORMALITY

There is a rich literature about the determinants of labor informality; Latin America is often a
region of interest in this area (Albrecht, Navarro, and Vroman 2009; Dabla-Norris, Gradstein, and
Inchauste 2008; Loayza 1996; Perry, Maloney et al. 2007; Ulyssea 2010). What follows is an
enumeration of the possible causes cited in an earlier publication by the ILO (2002) that
adequately reflects on the findings of the above authors.

Legal and institutional frameworks may influence the extent of informal employment. For
example, poorly designed and burdensome rules that involve dealing with corrupt and inefficient
bureaucracies increase transaction costs for potential entrepreneurs, discourage compliance,
impede economic participation, and encourage endemic corruption, thus discouraging
entrepreneurs from participating in the formal economy. Transaction costs can include obtaining
a license to conduct a business, acquisition of title to land or acquiring a lease, access to credit
facilities, labor and social charges, and tax costs. When enterprises are outside the legal and
regulatory framework, so too are their workers, who then do not enjoy the protection of the law.

Another key factor influencing the size of the informal economy is economic growth. Some
countries have experienced little or no growth in recent decades, while others have concentrated
on capital-intensive growth, resulting in growth that is not accompanied by a higher supply of
formal employment. In both contexts, not enough jobs are created for all those seeking work,
forcing people to find employment or to create their own work in the informal economy.

Economic reforms have also been linked to the growth of informal employment. The stabilization
and structural adjustment policies of the 1980s and 1990s are blamed in many countries for their
reportedly negative economic and social consequences, including growing poverty,
unemployment, and underemployment, and a consequent expansion of the informal economy.
The financial crisis in the second half of the 1990s in many Asian economies was also an


                                                11
important underlying factor. ILO research showed the informal economy expanded under the
impact of the financial crisis. In the transition economies, but elsewhere as well, economic
restructuring and the downsizing of enterprises led many laid-off workers to the informal
economy.

Another factor for informal employment is the pervasiveness of government as an employer in
poor countries and the public sector’s low wages. This pattern, widespread in Africa, compels
civil servants to supplement their meager public salaries with additional income from work in the
informal economy.

Poverty has also been blamed as a triggering factor for informal employment, although the link
between these two variables is not clear.

Demographic factors are viewed as a cause for growing labor informality. Informal employment
expands where formal businesses are unable to absorb the influx of young individuals looking for
work.

Population dynamics also contributes to work informality. Labor supply increases locally as a
result of an influx of migrants in search of jobs. Limited demand for formal labor leads to more
employment in the informal economy. In China, for example, the government has identified the
large number of rural-urban migrants (some 60 million) as an important reason for the need to
create jobs in the informal economy.

Informality makes health insurance reform difficult, while, on the other hand, health insurance
reform may encourage informality. What follows is evidence from the developing world that
publicly subsidized provision of health insurance may lead workers to leave the formal sector or
to avoid joining it, to circumvent the otherwise mandatory SHI contributions to health.

Camacho, Conover, and Hoyos (2009) studied whether the Colombian government, when
instituting and expanding social programs in the early 1990s, inadvertently created incentives for
people to become informal. As discussed below, Colombia’s 1994 reform created two regimes
within the country’s SHI system, one to be fully financed from the contributions of its
beneficiaries (non-poor working Colombians and their families), and another for the poor that
was to be fully subsidized from the nation’s treasury and from cross-subsidy from the
contributory component. Whereas the contributory regime had until recently a much more
comprehensive benefits package than the subsidized regime, this design did create incentives for
people to misrepresent their socioeconomic status to qualify for the subsidy. Camacho, Conover,
and Hoyos used data from repeated cross-sections of the Colombian Household Survey for
periods before and after implementation of the reform. They found robust and consistent
estimates of an increase in informal employment between 2 and 4 percentage points attributable
to the design attributes of the reform just mentioned.

A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred in Mexico, a country where more than half of all
workers are informally employed and one out of every four is poor. In his book Good Intentions,
Bad Outcomes, Levy (2008) argues that several subsidized social programs have hampered
growth, fostered illegality, and provided erratic protection to workers, trapping many in poverty.
In his research he also wondered whether noncontributory programs introduced in Mexico to act
as social safety nets for those outside the formal sector were providing perverse incentives for


                                               12
formal sector workers to switch to informal employment. By doing so, workers could avoid
having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to SHI while receiving some free services
under the new program. Levy argues that the high prevalence of work informality has presented
Mexico with a dilemma: provide benefits to informal workers at the expense of lower growth and
reduced productivity or leave millions of workers without benefits. He proposes a solution to
convert the existing system of social security for formal workers into universal social
entitlements. He advocates eliminating wage-based social security contributions and raising
consumption taxes on higher-income households to increase simultaneously the rate of growth of
GDP, reduce inequality, and improve benefits for workers.

Aterido et al. (2011) set out to examine whether Mexico’s subsidized health insurance program
for the poor, Seguro Popular, had the unintended consequence of promoting informal
employment, for the same reasons cited by Levy. These authors use panel data to address this
hypothesis and find that Seguro Popular may have increased labor informality by between 0.4
and 0.7 percentage points. Previous studies, which did not use econometric methods and data as
robust as the one by Aterido et al., also found a similarly small effect.

Wagstaff and Manachotphong (2012) studied the effects of Thailand’s subsidized health
program, known as the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), or “30-Baht scheme,” on labor
informality. They noted some key differences between Mexico’s Seguro Popular and Thailand’s
scheme, which could affect the magnitude of its consequences of informality.

First, Thailand’s scheme involves no copayments and minimal contributions for participation by
beneficiaries, while in Seguro Popular, contributions to the scheme are determined by the
applicant’s income. Second, Thailand’s scheme is relatively more generous than Mexico’s, with
average benefits in the former equal to 85 percent of the average benefits given by the
contributory scheme, compared to 65 percent for Mexico. Third, in Thailand, coverage of the
subsidized is for the individual worker only, while in Mexico it is for the worker and his or her
family.

The authors used data from Thailand’s Labor Force Survey and took advantage of the
incremental implementation of the UCS to identify its consequences on labor informality. The
authors found that Thailand’s UCS appears to have encouraged employment, especially among
married women; reduced formal-sector employment, at least among married men; and increased
informal-sector employment, especially among married women. The largest positive informal-
sector employment effects occur in the agricultural sector. By removing the financial risk of
health shocks resulting from informal-sector employment, UCS has allowed couples to switch
from a situation where the breadwinner works in an urban formal-sector job and the spouse
colocates but does not work, to one in which both work in informal-sector jobs in a rural setting.

There is also evidence from Chile that the government-subsidized component of the National
Health Fund (Fonasa) promotes informality and leads workers to underreport their income
(Bitrán 2012a). Fonasa’s indigent population represents over one-fourth of Chile’s total
population, yet poverty in Chile is only 14.4 percent. The distance between these two figures led
Fonasa authorities in 2010 to inquire about the existence of the so-called “false indigents.” The
inquiry involved first an analysis of the 2009 national Socioeconomic Characterization Survey
(CASEN), followed by cross-checking of Fonasa’s beneficiary roster with records from the


                                               13
Internal Tax Service. The enquiry revealed that approximately 400,000 individuals were illegally
enrolled in Fonasa’s Group A. Most of them were temporary and independent workers who made
no pension contributions. Contributing to the pension system is a legal requirement for all
Chilean workers, unless they are considered indigent. This confers a perverse incentive for some
to qualify as indigent, as they are thus relieved of the burden to put income away in the form of a
pension contribution.

        4.1.              INSURING THE POOR AND VULNERABLE AND THE INFORMALLY EMPLOYED

In his review of health insurance issues in East Asia, this author noted that the kind and extent of
insurance coverage that different countries can have depends largely on their level of
development, which determines the extent of poverty, informal employment, and availability of
fiscal resources (Bitrán 2005). Countries such as the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore
have a working population that is predominantly employed in the formal sector, with only a small
share of the population working in the informal sector and a small fraction living in poverty
(figure 8). These countries have achieved UHC through a health system that delivers a relatively
broad and homogeneous set of health services to the entire population. Government revenue is
high enough to subsidize health services for the poor and those in the informal sector.
Achievement of UHC by these countries was possible owing to the sustained economic growth
over more than two decades, which brought about additional needed tax revenue to government
to subsidize enrollment in SHI of the poor and nonpoor informal sector workers.

Middle-income countries such as China, Indonesia, and the Philippines have a relatively larger
share of the population in poverty or with informal employment. Each stratum has access to a
different set of health services. Government support is insufficient to fully subsidize health care
for the poor and the informally employed, which results in significant out-of-pocket payments
and limited financial protection for health care. This is particularly the case in China.

In low-income countries, such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam, a large share of the
economically active population works in the informal sector, and a significant proportion of the
population live in poverty. Their efforts to move toward UHC are hampered by their relatively
small tax base and the consequent fiscal limits on public resources available for the health sector.
Their publicly financed health systems rely heavily on user fees to supplement meager
government salaries and the lack of drugs and other resources. Also, the small proportion of the
working population in the formal sector limits the amount of revenue collected by the social
security agency. Political pressures to cover and fully subsidize several population groups,
(students, the near-poor, and ethnic minorities) under social security further complicates the task.


                4.2.   THE PROBLEMS POSED BY A SEGMENTED HEALTH SYSTEM

The challenges posed by the high prevalence of poverty and a large informal sector are
compounded by the existence of segmented health systems. Most developing countries have such
systems, where separate population groups, defined on the basis of income, employment status,
and other characteristics, have access to different health benefits and contribute variably to the
financing of these benefits. Frenk and Londoño (1997) noted this segmentation in their
“structured pluralism” paper. They pointed out that in Latin America the Ministry of Health was
the health system of the poor; the social security agencies managed the health system for the
formally employed; private insurers and providers constituted the health system for the high-
income segment; while a large segment of the non-poor population, mostly informal sector
workers and their families, were left without explicit health coverage.

This segmentation remains in place in much of Latin America and elsewhere in the developing
world today, although a few countries, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, and Thailand have, since
the appearance of that article, made great strides toward unifying their health systems.

The existence of a segmented health system brings about several problems that result in the
misuse of public subsidies, insufficient insurance coverage, greater informality, and smaller
social security and tax collection.

Figure 9 depicts the main features of those systems. In the middle section of the figure is the
population, broken into three groups: the poor and vulnerable, the non-poor informal sector, and
the non-poor formal sector. At the bottom of the figure are the insurers, including the Ministry of
Health (MOH), the social security institute, and private insurers. At the top of the figure are the
benefits provided by the insurers.

The MOH is financed mostly from treasury resources with a minor fraction also from user-fee
revenue, where such a policy exists. It generally provides undefined or nonexplicit coverage, by
making health services available to the entire population, or only to the lower-income segments
of the population. Due to limited public resources and poor management, it is usual for such
services to be rationed through queues, demand deflection, denial, and low-quality care. The
MOH typically delivers its services through a government-run network of health care providers at
the ambulatory and inpatient levels.

The social security institute is financed from mandatory contributions payments made by its
formal sector members and by voluntary contributions by its informal sector members. It may
offer two different benefits packages, a more modest one for voluntary enrollees from the
informal sector, and a more generous one for mandatory enrollees from the formal sector.

Private insurers are self-financed from voluntary premium payments made by their affiliates and
offer complementary insurance on a voluntary basis to high-income formal sector workers who
wish to purchase additional coverage beyond what is offered by the social security institute.
High-income self-employed individuals may also choose not to obtain social security coverage
and purchase private insurance.

those with large families or those who anticipate high utilization of health care services (for
example, families with one or more members with a chronic condition). This is known as adverse
selection. The voluntary premium that these enrollees pay is often nominal, to induce enrollment,
and it is also less than the average health expenditure generated by these individuals and their
families. Thus, SHI experiences a deficit with them.

Second, SHI tends to incur high administrative costs associated with the collection of those
contributions. Often, these costs are comparable to the revenue collected, leaving no or little
margin to defray health expenditures of the voluntary enrollees and their families.

Third, enrollment by informal sector workers is generally small; the vast majority of these
workers and their families remain uncovered. Lacking health insurance coverage leaves them
exposed to the uncertainty of having to face high out-of-pocket costs if the need arises.

Fourth, informal sector workers who are neither poor nor vulnerable and who decide not to enroll
with SHI on a voluntary basis, typically are able to obtain subsidized health care from MOH
providers. This implies that a share of public subsidies is badly targeted because it benefits
individuals who are not poor or vulnerable. In some countries (for example, Nicaragua), this
problem is compounded because the benefits package offered by the SHI agency has important
exclusions (for example, some expensive tertiary care), and therefore a majority of SHI
beneficiaries, both voluntary and mandatory enrollees and their dependents, use subsidized MOH
services.

Fifth, while it is common for the SHI benefits package to be superior in quality and scope to the
services offered by MOH, in some countries the difference is small enough to confer perverse
incentives. Some informal sector workers may decide to misrepresent their incomes or work
status to qualify as poor to obtain fully subsidized health care from MOH. This has been a
common phenomenon in Chile, where certain categories of workers (typically domestic service)
request the employer not to sign a legal contract, to be able to qualify as poor or indigent in
MOH’s means test. The employer has financial incentives to agree, as in the absence of a legal
contract, he or she does not have to pay the legal allowances of formal employees, which include
pension, unemployment insurance, and health insurance.

Sixth, formal sector workers may decide to leave the formal sector to become informal and obtain
subsidized health coverage. This has been a problem in Colombia, Mexico, and Thailand, as
described above. Likewise, individuals entering the labor force or those working in the informal
sector may decide not to join the formal sector to avoid the mandatory contributions they would
have to make for health, pension, disability and unemployment insurance.

Seventh, non-poor formal sector workers may have an incentive to underreport their income, or
to hide part of their income by receiving noncash benefits from employers (such as a free
company-provided car), to minimize the mandatory contribution to SHI. This problem was
common in Colombia during the first 15 years into the SHI reform. Upper-middle- and upper-
income formal sector workers did not value the coverage offered by their SHI institution and
instead purchased private health insurance. By declaring a minimum income and by making the



                                               17
minimum contribution to SHI they found a way of eluding higher requisite contribution. A
specific feature of the Colombian reform, aimed at achieving solidarity, proved to be its Achilles’
heel: the benefits package that SHI offered was the same irrespective of the amount of the
contribution. This problem has now been solved (more on Colombia’s reform below).

Figure 9, above, in its upper section shows the health benefits packages offered by the different
kinds of insurers. The difference in content among these packages and the cost of securing
coverage (that is, the premium or contribution) are the key variables that drive individual
decisions about which coverage to seek. Following are some relevant examples.

If the SHI agency offers informal sector workers voluntary enrollment in exchange for a small
monthly premium, potential enrollees will evaluate this option by determining the extent to which
the SHI benefits package on offer exceeds in quality the one offered for free by MOH. They will
then contrast the value of any additional benefits in relation to the monthly premium they are
required to contribute. 3 If the additional benefits are substantial, and the premium is small, they
may be inclined to enroll. If the additional benefits are marginal, they may prefer to forego this
option and remain explicitly uninsured but with the option of using MOH services at little or no
charge. An exception to this decision rule occurs when voluntary enrollment in SHI is
accompanied by additional legal requirements. This is the case in Chile, where the National
Health Fund, Fonasa, requires informal sector applicants to also contribute to a pension system.
This increases the cost of enrollment and may lead many informal sector workers to forego
coverage or to try and pass as indigent, to receive fully subsidized coverage by Fonasa.

Likewise, if the benefits package of voluntary informal enrollees is the same or similar to that of
formal sector enrollees, and if the latter are required to contribute much more to SHI than the
former, formal sector enrollees will have a strong incentive to misrepresent their employment
status or to shift to the informal sector.

As shown in the following section, a variety of designs devised by government or SHI agencies,
exist to cover informal sector workers. Often, however, these designs convey perverse incentives,
failing to attract a substantial share of informal workers while promoting informality. An overall
lesson that emerges from many of these country cases is that it is difficult to enroll informally
employed individuals on a voluntary basis, even if they are offered large enrollment subsidies.
Further, designs aimed at attracting the informal into a voluntary health insurance scheme may
introduce distortions in the system that lead to perverse behaviors, such as promoting informality
or the evasion and elusion of contributions.




3. Strictly speaking, when evaluating the options available, individuals actually assess their expected utility by
considering expected benefits and costs. They consider their subjective probability of needing health services in the
future, the out-of-pocket costs of those services if uninsured, and the stream of premium payments if insured.

                               4.3.   ENABLING FACTORS FOR UHC

Gertler noted that Asian countries that successfully achieved UHC through SHI — Japan, Korea,
Singapore, and Taiwan — were the ones that instituted universal SHI when their per capita
incomes were above US$5,000 (Gertler 1998). Countries that reach high levels of income
typically have stronger institutions, are largely urbanized, and have the majority of their
workforce in formal employment. For these countries, the early efforts to expand coverage and
the actual legal enactment of SHI were far apart. Korea, for example, started coverage expansion
efforts as early as 1963 with the introduction of voluntary health insurance, followed around
1980 by the enactment of legislation mandating coverage for the formally employed. In 1977, 8.7
percent of the population was covered. By 1987, this number had increased to 50 percent.
Encouraged by these results, government mandated universal health insurance coverage, so that
by July 1989, 100 percent of the population was legally eligible for coverage.

Urbanization in these four countries was relatively high by the time they achieved universal SHI
coverage. Further, due to the high growth of their
economies, they were able to absorb the rapid cost

introducing and expanding SHI in transition Asian
economies (figure 10) identified three categories of enabling factors for UHC: transition features,
structural characteristics, and country-specific features. Transition factors are those shared by
countries undergoing economic change. They include changes in employment structure (for
example, the privatization of state-owned firms leading to a reduction in employment in the
public sector and a growth in small private, mostly informal employment), exodus of rural health
workers to more lucrative jobs, and growing reliance on user fees in government health facilities.
Structural characteristics are features of a country that are important in determining the feasibility
of collecting revenues through a payroll tax. They include the proportion of the population
employed in the industrial sector, the proportion of the population that is urban, the population
density, the income of the country, and the growth in income.

The first three structural characteristics are proxies for the ease of registration and contribution to
SHI and thus for administrative costs. The last two structural characteristics are indicators of how


                                                  19
easy it will be for firms and individuals to afford SHI contributions. The country-specific features
that influence the feasibility of implementing SHI include the quality of management of health
insurance funds, the ability of managers to predict and match costs and revenue, and the
efficiency of purchasing practices.

Ensor (1999) used the first four of the five structural characteristics, and a method for ranking
them according to their deviation from the mean for a group of countries. 4



      V. THE CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE TO
                  INFORMAL SECTOR WORKERS
Providing informal sector workers and their families appropriate access to health services is a
central preoccupation of policy makers seeking to achieve UHC in developing countries.
Government providers typically operate with tight budgets and are characterized by unmotivated
health staff and a lack of medicines and basic supplies, which leads to rationing of care. Also, in
several low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Asia but also in Africa, government
providers charge legal or illegal user fees for their services. In addition, in the poorest countries a
large share of the population lives far away from the closest public health center or hospital, and
transportation is nonexistent or expensive. For all these reasons, access to services from public
providers for the poor and the non-poor informal population is not always feasible and often
involves significant cash payments. Private providers are their other health care option , but these
are generally self-financed through user fees, which limits access by the poor; their services also
tend to be unregulated, resulting in low-quality or unsafe services.

This section reviews the published literature on initiatives seeking to provide health insurance or
other forms of financial protection to the informally employed and their dependents. Since in
developing countries most of the poor are also informal, the initiatives reviewed include ones
aimed at insuring the poor (and informal), those aimed at insuring the nonpoor informal, and
others directed at both.


      5.1.    PREVIOUS REVIEWS OF HEALTH INSURANCE FOR INFORMAL SECTOR WORKERS

Providing health insurance for informal sector workers and their families has received
considerable attention from health policy researchers over the last 15 years. In 1998, Bennett et
al. (1998) published a major review consisting of 82 schemes that sought to promote risk sharing
of the costs of health care for persons outside formal sector employment. The schemes came from
a broad spectrum of developing countries and were diverse in the kinds of benefits they provided,
and in their governance and financing. With the important exception of China’s rural medical
scheme, few of the schemes reviewed covered very large populations or even high proportions of
the eligible population. Many had encountered substantial adverse selection problems,
particularly if at their outset they had not included design features to guard against these.

4. Shaw and Ainsworth (1996) developed a similar method earlier for Sub-Saharan Africa to compute a score that
measures the feasibility of implementing SHI.


                                                     20
All of the schemes depended on continuing access to some form of external subsidy. Yet few
reached the poorest households because most schemes seemed to target the rural middle class.
Purchasing functions under the schemes tended to be weak, with scheme managers commonly
focusing on raising revenue rather than ensuring efficient delivery of quality health care. The
authors noted that available evaluations of the schemes tended to ignore the interaction of the
schemes with the larger health system. The evaluations also showed that in the absence of an
adequate regulatory and policy framework for small-scale health insurance schemes, these may
avoid responsibility for chronic or severe patients (leaving these cases to the public sector),
attract unduly high levels of government and international subsidy, and introduce inefficiencies
into health care delivery by ignoring referral structures. They pointed out that unless there is
adequate targeting of government subsidies, schemes may actually generate greater inequity
between different population groups.

Gumber (2002) reviewed existing health insurance arrangements in India, including ones for
informal sector workers. He examined community-based and self-financing programs whose
target population was mainly the informal sector, noting that while they were able to raise some
revenue from members, they tended to be restricted to small population groups and covered a
limited range of health care services. This author reviewed health insurance schemes linked to
microcredit initiatives and remarked that a common source of credit default was the cash outlays
that households had to make to obtain health care, hence the drive to promote health insurance. A
noteworthy initiative in this context was India’s Self-Employed Women Association (SEWA),
which implemented a successful health insurance scheme for its 215,000 members, mostly
informal sector women.

In 2006, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), in collaboration with several
development partners, held an international conference titled, “Conference on Extending Health
Insurance to Informal Economy Workers,” which drew 200 delegates from 25 countries
(PhilHealth 2006). A synthesis report presented the event’s main findings and recommendations
over a broad range of key policy issues, such as labor market trends and the large and in some
places growing informal sector; the practical difficulties of collecting a steady and significant
stream of revenue from informal sector workers; the relative advantages of a single health
insurance fund compared to multiple funds; the trade-offs between efficiency, consumer
preferences, and financial protection involved in the design of benefits packages; the importance
of empowering the insured through the use of demand-side subsidies; the importance of making
enrollment mandatory; and the key role required of governments in the form of regulation and
technical guidance for the development of health insurance. A secondary motivation for the
conference was PhilHealth’s interest in exploring ways to boost enrollment among large numbers
of informal economy workers through linkages with community-based health insurance schemes,
small cooperative nongovernmental organizations, and large microfinance organizations and rural
banks.

The PhilHealth Synthesis Report questioned the common propensity among countries to seek
universal coverage through SHI. It identified three main approaches to coverage extension. The
first is SHI, whose advantages — according to the authors — are the extent of participation and
empowerment SHI promotes among contributing members and the revenue raised from
contributions. The authors note, however, that premium collection involves large administrative
costs and that the difficulty assessing participants’ income permits evasion of contributions and


                                               21
misallocation of government subsidies to the non-poor. The second approach is tax-based
financing, which removes the link between contributions and benefits. Its advantage is that it can
lead to rapid increase in coverage; however, it requires large amounts of government subsidies,
and these subsidies may end up benefitting the non-poor. The authors noted that Costa Rica,
Malaysia, and Sri Lanka are among the many countries that have adopted this approach. The third
approach is mixed, involving an SHI component alongside a tax-based component. Japan, Korea,
and Taiwan have followed this route.

A report by Acharya et al. (2012) presents findings from a detailed review of econometric studies
about the impact of health insurance arrangements for informal sector workers in the developing
world. The authors examined the impact from four perspectives: enrollment, health services
utilization, financial protection, and health status. While they reviewed studies on countries that
in the last decade have experienced large increases in health insurance coverage, such as China,
Ghana, and Vietnam, they saw no clear pattern of the influence on enrollment of other individual
variables such as age, gender, preexisting medical conditions, and distance to health providers.
They did find that, according to most studies, education increases a person’s propensity to enroll,.

Some of the studies reviewed by Acharya et al. found that insurance increased utilization of
various covered services, although contradictory findings also emerged from the same country
(for example, Mexico and its Seguro Popular —discussed below —, Vietnam, and China). As for
financial protection, the authors noted that none of the studies addressed financial protection
against worker absenteeism or reduced productivity from illness, and most addressed only out-of-
pocket spending (OOPS) but ignored the effect of premiums and entry fees on health insurance.
The authors mentioned a 2007 study on the limited impact of OOP expenditure for the insured in
Vietnam, where there was some protection for high expenditures, with the poor experiencing a
small effect. They also mentioned subsequent studies in Vietnam that did find a protective effect
of insurance. In China, only four out of sixteen studies found a protective effect of health
insurance, and five studies found a lower incidence of catastrophic expenditures. Finally, few
studies assessed heath impacts, and few among these found a positive health insurance effect.
One study from China was an exception. The authors recommended that more rigorous impact
evaluations should be conducted to assess health insurance impact, and that to achieve greater
impact, improvement in health care supply should always accompany health insurance expansion
efforts.


                   5.2.    COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE IN AFRICA

Community-based health insurance (CBHI), also referred to as health micro insurance or mutual
health organization (from the French Mutuelles de Santé) is a response, often spontaneous, by
many developing countries to the challenge described in the preceding paragraph. Donor support
of these initiatives has been common. Ekman (2004) conducted a systematic review of evidence
about the extent to which CBHI is a viable option for low-income countries in mobilizing
resources and providing financial protection. Overall he found that the evidence base is limited in
scope and questionable in quality. He also found strong evidence that CBHI provides some
financial protection by reducing OOPS and evidence of moderate strength that such schemes
improve cost-recovery. He obtained weak or no evidence that schemes have an effect on the
quality of care or the efficiency in production. In absolute terms, the effects are small, and


                                                22
schemes serve only a limited section of the population. He concluded that CBHI arrangements
are, at best, complementary to other more effective systems of health financing.

A background paper written for the World Health Report 2010 reviewed these efforts in the
context of the drive of countries to achieve UHC (Soors et al. 2010). These authors identified five
common characteristics of CBHI: risk pooling, risk sharing and membership premiums’
independence from individual health risks, community involvement in the schemes’ design and
management, nonprofit character, and voluntary affiliation. Where governments have built upon
these schemes in the quest for UHC, voluntary membership has been maintained (as in rural
China), or it has been replaced by mandatory enrollment (as in Ghana). Dror and Jacquier (2001)
introduced the concept of health micro insurance, where the term micro indicated that the
initiatives were local and below the national level.

The review by Soors et al. focused on four regions of the developing world — West Africa, East
and Central Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In West Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Ghana, Guinea, Mail, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Togo), the number of schemes increased
eightfold between 1997 and 2007, reaching 626 in 2007. They noted, however, that most of these
schemes had fewer than 1,000 members, thus limiting their ability to have effective (that is, large
enough) risk pools. They also pointed out that in many countries initiatives exist to form
networks for these schemes and to create legislation to govern them. In Senegal, prepayment
plans resulted in a drop in OOP expenditure out of total private expenditure, from 92 to 79
percent, but by 2007, less than 4 percent of the population was affiliated with one of the
country’s 130 CBHI schemes. In Ghana, the National Health Insurance Act of 2003 mandated the
creation of CBHI in every district, paving the way for a scale-up of CBHI as a strategy to achieve
UHC in the long term.

A debate persists about the merits of using contributions to the National Health Insurance
Scheme (NHIS) by the formal sector to subsidize enrollment by informal sector workers. By
2009, reported coverage by Ghana’s NHIS was almost 50 percent, although there is evidence that
many of those with an insurance card were inactive enrollees (Bitrán 2012b). There is recent
evidence that Ghana’s NHIS has helped improve financial protection and access to maternal and
child health services (Makinen et al. 2011; Nguyen, Rajkotia and Wang 2011; Sulzbach 2008).
Elsewhere in Western Africa the relevance of CBHI is still small as measured by the share of the
population covered and by the amount of financing channeled through these mechanisms.

In Central and Eastern Africa, CBHI has drawn growing attention by governments, although
outside of Rwanda these schemes are either new or cover only a small fraction of the total
population. In Rwanda, the growing mutuelles led to a government decision in 1999 to use them
as the springboard to UHC. By 2008, national coverage was 85 percent. Recent evidence shows
that mutuelles improved medical care utilization and protected households from catastrophic
health spending, although enrollees in the poorest expenditure quintile had a significantly lower
rate of utilization and a higher rate of catastrophic health spending (Lu et al. 2012).

CBHI also plays an important role in Asia, particularly in India and Bangladesh. China’s New
Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) is classified by some as a form of CBHI (Soors et




                                                23
al. 2010), and it meets the five common characteristics of CBHI listed above. Thus, it is
presented below along with the experiences of India. 5



                         5.3.    COMMUNITY HEALTH INSURANCE IN INDIA

It is estimated that about two-fifths of India’s GDP originates from the informal sector and
almost 90 percent of families depend on this sector for their livelihood (Gumber and Kulkarni
2000). The challenges to informal sector families of meeting health expenditures have given rise
to several local and national initiatives to provide health insurance. Member-financed CBHI
exists in India although this author could not find published figures about the total number or
percentage of Indians actually covered through this mechanism. Millions of Indians are insured
under schemes that are financed partly by beneficiary communities but obtain a majority of their
funding from central or local governments. They are reported in the next section.

The information gathered by Soors et al. (2010) suggests that member-financed CBHI in India
mobilizes a relatively small volume of total health financing resources. These authors reported
that the share of prepayment plans (including CBHI but not mandatory health insurance) in
private health expenditure rose from 1.0 to 2.1 percent between 2000 and 2007 — both modest
amounts — while out-of-pocket expenditure as a proportion of private health expenditure
dropped from 92.2 to 89.9 percent over the same period.

Dror et al. (2007) assessed willingness to pay for health insurance among 3,024 Indian
households in seven locations where micro health insurance units were in operation. They found
that about two-thirds of the sample agreed to pay at least one percent of annual household income
for health insurance. They also found evidence of adverse selection because households that had
experienced a high-cost health event (as well as male respondents) reported slightly higher
willingness to pay. In a subsequent study, Dror (2007) carried out a simulation exercise using
household-level data on health utilization and expenditure to determine the extent to which
existing microinsurance regulations would lead to adequate financial protection of households.
He found that regulations were inappropriate and would result in the supply of health insurance
schemes that would provide only limited financial protection. According to this second study by
Dror, it was the unattractive value of the health insurance being offered that resulted in low
demand, rather than a low willingness to pay for health insurance.


      5.4.    GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEMES (GSHISS) IN INDIA

These schemes were launched in India in 2007 as an attempt to cover the country’s poor. 6 Prior
to the appearance of GSHISs, nearly all public financing was directed to the government-owned-
and-operated service delivery system to support an implicit (and often undelivered) benefits
package. The poor were commonly faced with steep OOPS to resolve their health needs in both
public and private facilities. In 2007, out-of-pocket health spending accounted for approximately

5. Ekman 2004, who shows that CBHI helps reduce OOPS by members.
6. This section is a brief summary from Health Insurance India Are You Covered?, vol. 72238, Directions in
Development, Human Development, World Bank, Washington, DC, 2012.


                                                   24
80 percent of all health financing in the country. In 2010, only three years into the birth of
GSHISs, about 240 million Indians (or 19 percent of the population) were already covered by
these schemes, (see table 1). GSHIS’s target population consists of those living below the poverty
line (BPL) and the informal sector; however, the definition of BPL lists varies across schemes.
The aim of GSHISs is to provide financial protection to the poor against catastrophic health
shocks.

Accordingly, most of the newer schemes demonstrate a strong emphasis on surgical procedures.
Ambulatory care is largely uncovered except for limited coverage as part of an inpatient episode.
Most schemes limit their exposure through annual family caps, ranging from Rs 30,000 for the
health insurance scheme (Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, RSBY) to Rs 150,000 for the
Andhra Pradesh scheme. Most GSHISs are marginally linked to the public delivery system, and
most networked hospitals are private. For the tertiary-focused state GSHISs particularly, one of
the main reasons to initiate these schemes was the limited capacity in the public sector to provide
tertiary care. La Forgia and Nagpal (2012) forecast that in light of current trends, and assuming
continued political and financial support from government, insurance coverage can be expected
(conservatively) to exceed 630 million persons (50 percent of the population) by 2015. GSHIS
coverage will likely more than double, from 243 million in 2009–10 to nearly 530 million in
2015.

                              5.5.    HEALTH INSURANCE IN CHINA

In China, a large government initiative to provide insurance to the rural population is known as
the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), rolled out during 2003–08. It is a
voluntary health insurance program for rural residents not employed in the formal sector. Its
financing comes from premiums paid by enrollees and from local and central government
subsidies. The NRCMS differs from the system it replaced, the now extinct Cooperative Medical
Scheme (CMS), in that in the previous system, enrollment was mandatory and financing was
derived from commune income (Wagstaff et al. 2009).

Soors et al. (2010) report modest gains in financial coverage associated with NRCMS at the
country level: between 2000 and 2007, the share of prepayment plans in private health
expenditure rose from 1.0 to 7.1 percent, while out-of-pocket expenditure as a proportion of
private health expenditure dropped from 97.3 to 92.0 percent over the same period. Several
studies have found that with NRCMS, the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures had
fallen only mildly as had the incidence of poverty from high OOPS. This slight impact on
financial protection contrasts with the reported expansion in population coverage: according to
official data, the NRCMS covered 73 percent of the targeted rural population in 2004 and had
reached 95 percent in 2008.

Various studies reported by Soors et al. (2010), including a comprehensive review of recent
studies of China’s health care reform by Wagstaff et al. (2009), have confirmed the limited
financial protection conferred by NRCMS. Several authors agree that increased public finding is
necessary but not sufficient to improve financial protection of NRCMS; additional medical
financial assistance (MFA) safety-net programs for the urban and rural extreme poor was started
in 2003 and is closely linked to the NRCMS. Its performance in terms of financial protection,
however, has been even weaker than that of NRCMS.


                                               27
There is consensus among researchers; however, that China’s reform has resulted in improved
accessibility to health services and, in some cases, also in better health status (Soors et al. 2010;
Yip et al. 2012). Further, Yip et al. (2012) report that by 2011, China’s three large SHI programs
covered more than 92 percent of the country’s population. Table 2, lists the three schemes and
their characteristics for the years 2008 and 2010. The first scheme listed, Urban Employee Basic
Medical Insurance (UEBMI), covers formal sector workers and is cofinanced by the worker and
the employer, with the employer contributing about three times as much as the worker. This
scheme receives no public subsidies.

The Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) program covers children, students, the
elderly without previous employment, informal sector workers, and migrants in some cities. This
scheme also involves a contribution, set at the individual level, although its absolute value
represents about one-tenth the total premium per person of the UEBMI. Unlike the UEBMI, this
scheme does receive a government subsidy, which increased from ¥80 to ¥120 between 2008 and
2010, and which was due to increase to ¥200 in 2011. The NRCMS, described above, also calls
for an individual contribution, which in 2011 was expected to be the same as that of the URBMI.
It also benefits from government subsidies, which by 2011 were expected to be the same, on an
individual basis, as those received by the URBMI.

Importantly, the premium of formal sector workers is more than 10 times higher than that of
informal workers, and the premium for informal workers is similar in urban and rural areas.
Counting both the premium and the governments’ premium subsidy, the per-member contribution
to insurance for the poor, students, and informal workers represents only one-fourth the
contribution of formal sector SHI. Accordingly, there are important differences in benefits. The
reimbursement rate for inpatient services is lower in subsidized insurance than in insurance for
formal workers. In the latter, coverage of outpatient services comes from health savings accounts,
whereas in subsidized insurance it comes from out-of-pocket payments and subsidies from
counties and cities.


                        5.6.     ACHIEVING UHC IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA 7

Korea’s SHI system, instituted in 1977, covers the entire population, with a mostly contributory
component — the National Health Insurance (NHI) — for the employed and the self-employed,
covering 96 percent of the population, and a fully subsidized component — the Medical Aid
Program (MAP) — for the poor, covering 4 percent. In 2009 it was estimated that about one-
fourth of the country’s population belonged to a family where the income earners were self-
employed.

Developing a system to draw contributions from the self-employed was a significant
administrative challenge because it was difficult first to locate the self-employed and second to
collect contributions from them. To devise a collection system, in 1981 the government started
pilot tests in three counties, expanded these to more areas, and then conducted a second set of
pilot tests around 1985. From these tests the government devised a method to determine the
amount of contributions that self-employed households would make to NHI. The method
considered two kinds of contributions: one with two portions, which included a flat fee for all
households plus a fee proportional to the number of household members, and another with three
portions, which were determined on the basis of household income, property, and car ownership.
Benefit levels were set equal for formally employed and self-employed workers and their
families.

Initially, the collection rate was below 50 percent, even though total contributions for the self-
employed were set below those of workers employed by a firm. After reviewing results from the
pilots, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs decided to subsidize insurance for the self-
employed beyond an initially modest subsidy directed solely at operating and maintenance
expenses. Problems in estimating incomes of the self-employed remain unresolved; if anything,
these have become more pronounced as insurance for urban areas has expanded since 1989. The
pilot projects were implemented primarily in the farming and fishing sectors, and therefore it has
proved difficult to apply lessons learned to urban areas where prevailing the income structure and
lifestyle are different. This remains a considerable challenge for the authorities concerned.

The current system to determine NHI contributions for the self-employed is depicted in figure 11.
Contributions by a household are proportional to a scoring system that depends in part on the

household’s taxable or estimated income, and partly on the value and size of the property it
occupies and the size and age of the car it owns. Jeong (2010) notes that while the current
calculation system is more detailed than the previous, it leaves much to be desired in terms of
transparency. Indeed, the calculation system is so complicated that laymen often cannot
understand how their contributions are calculated.

One out of six employees of the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC — with a total
staff of 8,874) is in charge of contribution collection. There are 178 NHIC branches countrywide
with nine employees on average in charge of collection in each branch, each employee taking
charge of 10,725 locality subscribers and 7,836 employee subscribers. NHIC staff levy and
collect insurance contributions on a monthly basis and are scheduled to collect the contributions
of pension insurance, employment insurance, and industrial injury compensation insurance as
well as health insurance from 2011 onwards in accordance with the reform plan introduced in
2009. Efforts to reduce arrears in insurance contributions account for a considerable portion of
the NHIC’s duties. Targets for a certain level of collection are set each year and each month, and
collection results are analyzed and managed by each branch on a competitive basis. Credit card
and internet payments are allowed to facilitate the task of contributors.

Financing of NHI comes mainly from contributions by the employed and the self-employed, but
also from subsidies provided by government and, since 2002, from proceeds from a tobacco levy
(figure 12). The self-employed members of NHI have declined as a proportion of total members,
from just over 50 percent in 1995 to 37 percent in 2008 (figure 13). This is partly the result of
regulations since 2003 that require businesses with even one employee on the payroll to switch
over to a worksite insurance subscription. The contributions to NHI by the self-employed are
below their share of membership. For example in 2008 the self-employed represented 37 percent
of all contributors to NHI, but their contribution was only 24 percent of total member
contributions. This resulted partly from the relatively lower incomes of the self-employed, but
also because of lack of data required to levy taxes and insufficient exploration of ways to expand
the contribution base. Contribution revenues can be increased by expanding the contribution
base, for instance, the incomes that are subject to tax. Another way of increasing revenues is to
reduce leakage and underreporting of income, which would probably result in an increase of the
number of households, including those in high-income groups, who contribute to the NHI.

The administrative costs of NHIC have dropped from about 9 percent in 1990 to 2.4 percent in
2008. The bulk of these costs is attributable to the collection of contributions from the self-
employed. Jeong (2010) concludes that three factors have allowed the Republic of Korea to
establish an effective contribution system for the self-employed population and insurance
coverage for all within the relatively short period of 12 years. First, contributions for the self-
employed were set below cost at a level that was deemed affordable. Second, support from the
national treasury made it possible to keep this level of contributions at the relatively low level.
Third, sustained economic growth has also contributed to success: In spite of rising medical
expenditures and the contributions required to support of them, the capacity of the nation as a
whole to pay has also grown.


                                            5.7.           ACHIEVING UHC IN INDONESIA8


Indonesia exhibits one of the lowest levels of total health spending in the world, with only 2.9
percent of GDP allocated to health. Low public spending on health results from poor fiscal
capacity and a low priority given to the health sector by policy makers.

Despite this low resource base, in the past decade the government has taken significant steps
toward universal coverage for social protection through laws 40/2004 on the National Social
Security System and Law 24/2011 on Social Security Administrative Bodies (Badan
Penyelenggara Jaminan, PJS). The latter law calls for integration, starting in 2014, of the current
fragmented system of multiple health insurance schemes under the BPJS Health Insurance
organization, creating the largest single payer system in the world.

According to Indonesia’s Central Bureau of Statistics, about two-thirds of Indonesians were
employed in the informal economy in 2009, often with low pay, hazardous working conditions,

                                                                    32
and no social security (ILO 2013). A study commissioned by the ILO on extending social
security to the informal economy found that in Indonesia the informal economy is both a rural
and an urban phenomenon with a huge disparity among the regions. The size of the informal
economy increased since the financial crisis in 1998, which stalled the economic transformation
from agriculture to industrialization in Indonesia. Mukti (2013) reports that currently 73.2 million
persons in Indonesia are informal workers, of these, 53.2 million are paid informal workers and
20 million are unpaid workers; substantial numbers of all informal workers are not yet covered
with health insurance.

Mukti also estimates that 58 percent of Indonesians are currently covered by SHI (table 3), and
concludes that achieving UHC, as mandated by law, will require significant additional public
resources to subsidize the enrollment of the poor and near-poor and of informal workers. Even
after the envisaged expansion of contribution-free coverage from 76.4 million covered currently
by Jamkesmas (first row of table 3) to 96.4 million to be covered by BPJS in 2014, a substantial
number of informal workers will not have health insurance. Calculations based on a 2011–12
study of the informal economy suggest that 31.2 million (paid) informal workers will not be
covered by health insurance in 2014 (Mutki 2013). This coverage gap needs to be addressed to
achieve UHC.

The current policy defines an income cutoff point; under that point government finances SHI
coverage and over it, the worker does. According to the informal economy study just mentioned,
approximately one-third of all informal workers are covered with health insurance paid for by
contribution assistance from the government. It is estimated that a substantial number of informal
workers will be over the cutoff point and therefore will be required to pay contributions to BPJS
Health. According to Mukti, this will create inequity since people with almost the same income
will be subject to a different financing regime: those immediately below the cutoff getting a full
premium subsidy and those immediately above receiving none. In an alternative policy scenario,
were all informal workers to be covered by government funds, another equity issue would
emerge: people with the same ability to pay would be treated differently based on the status of
their work relationship (formal versus informal). This could lead to greater informality.


                                                33
Mukti proposes that Indonesia should avoid getting “stuck” at current levels of coverage
experienced in recent decades in other countries, such as Egypt (55 percent), Iran (78 percent),
and more recently the East Asian countries of Philippines (65 percent) and Vietnam (58 percent).
In each case, he notes, it has been the near-poor and informal sectors that have been left out of the
coverage enrollment process due to insistence that it be a fully contributory scheme. China and
Thailand, on the other hand, will reach full universal coverage through an essential abandonment
of contributory approaches and an almost total reliance on general revenues.

The World Bank has estimated that UHC will cost an additional $13 to $16 billion once
implemented. Mukti believes that government cannot afford currently to fully subsidize every
near-poor and informal sector individual, but that it might want to consider a phased subsidy
strategy which could match central funding with provincial-level, district-level, and minimal
family contributions, much as was successfully done in China over the last five years. Annual
premiums per capita would be less than $30 year according to the government’s own model. Part
of this phased effort might be to leverage new revenues from one or more of the following
measures: a new tobacco tax, a phasing-out of the fuel subsidy, an increase in the value added
tax, or gains in efficiency in government health spending.


          5.8.    BRAZIL’S SHIFT FROM SHI TO GENERAL TAX FINANCING FOR HEALTH

Most developing countries seeking UHC have adopted a strategy that relies on SHI to finance
coverage expansion. Brazil is an exception. Until 1988 its health system was similar to others in
Latin American countries: it was segmented and had a social security agency that collected
premiums from formal sector workers and provided them with health care services through its
own network of health care providers. In principle Ministry of Health providers offered universal
access to health services to all Brazilians, but in practice the ministry rationed services in various
ways due to budget limitations. Higher-income individuals wishing to have additional health
insurance coverage purchased private insurance. Starting in 1988, Brazil made changes to its
constitution to abandon SHI and create the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde —
SUS), a publicly financed agency that would provide comprehensive health care to all Brazilians
irrespective of income, location, age, gender, and work status. Funding for SUS comes from tax
revenues and so-called social contributions (taxes that in principle were earmarked for health)
from the federal, state, and municipal budgets (Government of Brazil 2013). Other sources of
funding of Brazil’s health care system are private, including out-of-pocket and employer
spending (Paim et al. 2011).

When Brazil made the decision to switch to a general tax-financed health system, approximately
40 percent of its working population was in the informal sector. Ten year earlier, in 1980,
informality was higher, equal to 50 percent. Since the implementation of SUS, informality has
expanded, and by 2007 it stood at 44 percent. A study by Bosch et al. (2007) about the
determinants of labor informality in Brazil identifies multiple causes but does not attribute it in
any part to changes in the financing of the health system. Estevão and Carvalho-Filho (2012)
describe the high rate of informality to labor market rigidities resulting from regulations
introduced by government.




                                                 34
A broad review of the achievements and challenges of Brazil’s SUS by Paim et al. (2011)
concludes that “the SUS has vastly increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of
the Brazilian population, achieved universal coverage of vaccination and prenatal care, enhanced
public awareness of health as a citizen’s right, and invested in the expansion of human resources
and technology, including production of most of the country’s pharmaceutical needs.” Yet they
also conclude that funding for the SUS has not been sufficient to ensure adequate or stable
financial resources for the public system. They report that the SUS has thus done less to increase
public funding for people’s health care needs than its original goal to establish a universal and
equitable health system in Brazil funded with public resources. According to household survey
data, in 1981, about 67 percent of total health services provided in the month before the survey
were paid for by public funds, 9 percent by private health plans or insurance policies, and 21
percent by OOP spending. By 2003, the proportion of health service consumption paid for by
public funds fell to 56 percent and remained at that level in 2008. Taxes that were originally
earmarked for health, such as the 1997 tax on financial transactions, were diverted for other
purposes. The same authors reported that in 2006 only 40 percent of the revenue raised through
this tax went to SUS, while 60 percent was diverted to pay the public debt. They also noted that
since 2007, reductions in the federal share of SUS financing have been only partly balanced by
increased state and municipal health spending. Further, since 2003 real federal health spending
has fallen. In 2007 total health spending as a share of GDP was 8.7 percent, up from 6.7 percent
in 1990, but the public share of total health spending has remained rather constant since 1990, at
43 percent. Out-of-pocket health spending as a share of health financing has increased since the
advent of SUS.

Offering a balanced assessment of Brazil’s SUS reform is beyond the scope of this report. It
appears that SUS has brought about progress in the health sector but has also been fraught with
problems. Without a detailed assessment it is not possible to calculate whether SUS created better
equity and efficiency than would have been achieved under the previous SHI system. The
available evidence does not allow an assessment of the specific impact of SUS on access,
satisfaction, and financial protection in health for informal sector workers and their families. In
any case, Brazil’s policy initiative does not stand out as a panacea.

       5.9.    SWITCHING TO A TAX-FINANCED HEALTH SYSTEM: OECD AND THAILAND

Brazil is not the only country in the world that has switched from SHI to a tax-financed health
system. As is shown in table 4, among OECD countries, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Greece, and
Portugal have all made a similar decision in the 1970s or 1980s. In the developing world
Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) health reform stands out as a widely publicized
initiative that sought to move away from the fragmented health system that included a SHI
component, to an integrated system financed through general tax revenue.

This report cannot attempt to offer a comprehensive assessment of Thailand’s and other
countries’ reform on health sector outcome variables for informal sector workers. It can,
however, suggest that SHI is not the only viable or advisable policy option to expand health
coverage in developing countries or to improve the health situation of informal sector workers. A
useful discussion about the limitations of SHI in the context of achieving UHC can be found in
Wagstaff (2007).

The remainder of this section presents eight additional country case studies covering three
regions of the developing world, to illustrate additional policy approaches and results related to
the provision of health coverage for informal sector workers and their families. The cases draw
on the author’s knowledge of these countries and information obtained by this author through
structured interviews of expert country informants, with supplemental information obtained from
the literature. The countries are, in ascending order of purchasing power–adjusted per capita
income: Ghana, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and
Chile. Selected demographic, economic, and health resource indicators are presented for these
countries. The cases provide a brief description of the health insurance system and its coverage of
different population groups. They also present information about the magnitude of the informal
sector and the efforts made by governments to promote coverage with health insurance. Figure 14

As elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana’s health system was created after independence with
a tax-funded government network of health care providers that offered services free of direct
charge to all citizens. To alleviate fiscal pressures, in the mid-1980s Ghana introduced user fees
in government health facilities, and this improved the availability of drugs and supplies among
these providers. During the 1990s, community health insurance developed across the country. In

2000, the New Patriotic Front promised to abolish user fees and to set up the National Health
Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to remove financial barriers to health services. The National Health
Insurance Act 650 of 2003 positioned NHIS to provide a broad range of health care services to
Ghanaians through district mutual and private health insurance schemes. Insurance enrollment
began in earnest in late 2005. Until then, less than 5 percent of all Ghanaians had some form of
health insurance coverage, mostly provided by large employers and by some mutual health
organizations.

The NHIS is financed through the following sources: (a) sales tax, value-added tax, and levies
(2.5 percentage points), which fund most of those who are exempt; (b) payroll taxes, Social
Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), at 2.5 percentage points, which covers most of
the SSNIT contributors and pensioners; and (c) voluntary premiums, which cover most of the
informal sector workers (Saleh 2013).

According to data from Ghana’s 2008 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), coverage by the
NHIS was 39 percent for women and about 30 percent for men (Makinen et al. 2011). Total
coverage was estimated at 34.5 percent.

It is estimated that informal employment accounts for 80 percent of all employment in Ghana
(Osei-Boateng and Ampratwum 2011). Enrollment in NHIS by informal workers is not
mandatory and calls for the payment of an annual premium equal to about US$10 per family
member, except for children under 18, who by law are exempt. Reportedly, the government of
Ghana is experiencing difficulties in enrolling individuals from the informal sector. According to
one report, by the end of 2006, only about 22 percent of workers in the informal sector had
enrolled in the NHIS (Wahab 2008).

Shieber et al. (2012) conclude that “the fact that an estimated 70–90 percent of Ghana’s labor
force works in the informal sector and that most firms are very small provides significant
challenges to both revenue collection and enrollment in the NHIS”. These authors also note that
premiums for informal sector workers are low relative to their costs and that 70 percent of firms
in Ghana have fewer than five employees. These facts and the high share of informal
employment are partially responsible for NHIS’s currently low revenues and premium collection.
The authors conclude that if Ghana cannot productively employ people entering the labor force,
this may lead to lower economic growth, tax revenues, and NHIS premium income.

One-third of Cambodia’s population lives in poverty (World Bank 2013) and about 20 percent
live in extreme poverty. Cambodia’s private sector is dominated by the informal economy, which
accounts for 80 percent of GDP and close to 90 percent of employment. Much of informal
employment is found in agriculture. Only around 7,000 enterprises are registered and are focused
on garments and tourism (International Labour Organization 2007).

Out-of-pocket health spending is the main source of health financing in Cambodia, as in several
other Asian countries (for example, China, India, Vietnam), representing more than two-thirds of
total health spending. Government health care providers are strongly dependent on user fees to
supplement health workers’ incomes and to purchase drugs and supplies.

The chief mechanisms that confer financial protection in health to the population are health
equity funds (HEF) and community-based health insurance (CBHI). HEFs pool resources from
government and donors to finance health care for the poor who seek ambulatory and inpatient
health care in government health facilities. HEFs cover a set of defined inpatient and outpatient
health services. Two types of means tests are used in the country to assess HEF eligibility. One
was adopted by the MOH for post-identification, that is, to assess eligibility of individuals
applying for HEF support when seeking health care. Another was adopted by the Ministry of
Planning to determine HEF eligibility at the household level. Thus, HEFs function as a safety net
for poor, uncovered individuals when they are seeking health care, and as insurance for
households that have qualified for HEF coverage. Individuals covered by an HEF may get a
partial or a full user-fee waiver in government facilities. It is estimated that 80 percent of
Cambodia’s poor are covered or get coverage from an HEF.

Voluntary CBHI schemes, which aim to cover informal-sector workers who can afford to pay the
premiums, are implemented in several health operational districts. Enrollment in CBHI involves a
periodic prepayment and may or may not require copayments at the time of service delivery. Like
HEFs, CBHI schemes rely exclusively on public health care providers. Current coverage of
CBHI is a mere 2 percent of the population. A reason for this low coverage is the poor reputation
of the quality of health care in government health facilities, which are the sole providers of
CBHI. The nongovernmental organization Research and Technology Exchange Group (Groupe
de Recherche et d’Echanges Technologiques, GRET) has set up CBHI in Cambodia and is
supporting its further development. It has documented improved access to health services for its
members and better referral patterns (International Labour Organization 2007).

Cambodia’s government successfully scaled up HEFs to much of the country in the mid- 2000s,
replicating a range of designs that had previously been carried out by donors as small pilots in
various parts of the country. Currently, the government, MOH, and development partners are
preparing to further scale up HEF and CBHI, and to move their administration from
nongovernmental agencies currently managing them to the jurisdiction of a national institution or
administration (Annear and Ahmed 2012). In addition, policy makers are discussing the option of
making health insurance compulsory and creating a national agency to manage social protection
for informal sector workers.

                                            5.12. VIETNAM 11
Vietnam’s Health Insurance Law of 2008 mandates enrollment of all citizens in the country’s
SHI agency, Vietnam Social Security (VSS). By the end of 2010, nearly 60 percent of the
country’s population was covered by SHI (figure 16) (Tien 2012). The 2008 law envisioned that
farmers would have SHI coverage by 2012 and remaining groups of the informal sector by 2014
(see the timing of enrollment of various population groups into SHI in figure 19).

To promote enrollment in SHI, certain population groups, including the poor, minority ethnic
groups, and households living in disadvantaged areas are not required to make any contribution
to SHI. In addition, government subsidizes 70 percent of a flat premium for the near-poor and 30
percent for medium-income farmers. High-income farmers are required to contribute the full
premium. While SHI beneficiaries can use both public and private providers, public providers are
dominant in Vietnam (for example, 95 percent of all hospital beds are public).

Vietnam, like other countries in the region, has recognized that expanding coverage based on
contributory mechanisms alone is not feasible in a context where a large share of the population
is still poor, in the informal sector, or both (Somanathan et al. 2012). The expansion of SHI in
Vietnam has been financed largely through tax subsidies to cover insurance premiums for the
poor and other vulnerable groups. As SHI expanded rapidly during 2006 to 2010, government
share of SHI revenues rose from 29 percent to almost 50 percent. Government health spending
increased at a faster rate than economic growth in the same period. By comparison, income
elasticity of government health spending was only about 0.5, which indicates that there was a
clear upward shift in government health spending after 2006. This includes government subsidies
to cover the premium costs of enrolling the poor and other vulnerable groups, and partial
subsidies to cover the premium costs of enrolling the near-poor. Contributions from employers,
employees, and other individuals have declined as a share of total revenues. Overall,
government’s share of total health expenditure was higher in the second half of the decade 2001-
2010 than in the first half (figure 17), reflecting government’s effort to increase public funding
for SHI.

Informality is very high in Vietnam: three out of four of its 46 million workers are informally
employed (Meibner 2011). Efforts to expand coverage to informal sector workers were tried with
community financing schemes in 1983 and the Voluntary Health Card Scheme in 1991.
However, neither program was successful due to problems of adverse selection and moral hazard
that derived from their voluntary nature (Somanathan et al. 2012).

Currently, about 60 percent of informal sector workers are covered by SHI. Formal and informal
sector workers with SHI coverage have the same benefits package and official level of
copayment (approximately 20 percent of health care costs). The poor have a lower copayment of
only 5 percent. There is no ceiling for copayments by SHI beneficiaries. That only a fraction of
informal sector workers are covered by VSS may be explained by (1) low quality of care in the
primary health care network discourages enrollment in SHI, (2) the 30 percent premium
constitutes a financial barrier for enrollment for the near-poor, and (3) SHI confers limited
financial protection because copayments are not capped and public providers demand high
informal payments.


                                                                                                                      42
In their recent World Bank report, Somananthan et al. (2012) recommended a series of measures
to achieve UHC in Vietnam, including: (1) expanding the breadth of coverage of SHI,
particularly for those hard-to-reach groups, such as the near-poor and the informal sector; (2)
substantially increasing general revenue subsidies to pay for expanded coverage for informal
sector workers and their families; (3) fully subsidizing the premiums for the near-poor; (4)
making enrollment mandatory for all citizens and introducing measures to enforce enrollment
compliance; and (5) providing financial incentives to promote family coverage for formal sector
workers, instead of only employee coverage (as is currently the case).

Somananthan et al. argued that the first two measures were administratively more efficient than
attempting to expand contributory SHI for the near-poor and the informal sector, and were an
effective means to curtail adverse selection. They also concluded that increased health insurance
coverage would be ineffective unless actions were taken to reduce OOPS by the insured.
Proposed actions included enforcing strict controls on balance billing and providing a basic
benefits package that could be fully financed through VSS reimbursements and subsidies. The
authors of the report argued that both actions required systemic reforms over the medium to
longer term, including reforms to provider payment mechanisms and the delivery system. In the
short-to-medium term, proposed measures to contain the cost of OOPS included strengthening
the implementation of the copayment policy, making the policy more transparent, further
reducing copayments for the poor, introducing catastrophic cost coverage, and shifting patients’
preference toward lower-cost generic drugs.

The Dominican Republic emulated many elements of the Colombian Ley 100 reform (see
Colombia’s case below), but added some complexity to it. The Family Health Insurance Law 87-
01 (2001), created three regimes (instead of Colombia’s two) — the co-called Contributory
Regime (CR), intended for formal sector workers; the Contributory Subsidized Regime (CSR),
intended for nonpoor informal sector workers; and the Subsidized Regime (SR), for the poor. The
reform started off slowly in the public system in 2002 and the CR, along with the coverage
expansion process, came into effect at the end of 2007.

In the CR, about 10 percent of a worker’s salary is allocated to health, with a split in payment
between the employee (3 percent) and employer (7 percent). As in Colombia, there is also a cap
(equal to 10 minimum legal salaries), on the salary or income that is subject to the 10 percent
health contribution. Although the CSR has not yet been implemented, the law states that informal
sector workers should contribute a multiple of the minimum wage (depending on the average
income of each occupational category). The government would subsidize the amount paid by the
employer (as in the CR). The government uses a means-testing instrument known as the Single
System of Beneficiaries (Sistema de Identificación de Beneficiarios-Indice de Condiciones de
Vida, SIUBEN), and has developed a national conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, to
determine citizens’ eligibility for the SR.

Members of the two regimes that have been implemented, the CR and the SR, are expected to
receive the same benefits package, but the services they receive differ because they are delivered
by different kinds of providers. The CR relies on private providers while the SR uses mostly
public providers. Coverage in both is for the entire family (figure 19).

The same incentives to evade contributions, discussed in Colombia’s case below, may be present
in the Dominican Republic’s SHI system. Thus, it is likely that some nonpoor informal sector
workers have managed to get coverage under the SR, that formal- and informal-sector workers
underdeclare their income, and that informal sector workers have evaded their obligation to enroll
in the system.

In 2007, 27 percent of the population was covered by insurance. In mid-2009, just two years after
the launch of the CR, coverage had risen to almost 40 percent (figure 20). Rathe estimates that
about one-half of formal sector workers still remain to be enrolled in the CR, and two-thirds of
the poor also remain to be enrolled in the SR (Rathe 2010). The yet-to-be-implemented CSR
would have a target beneficiary population of about 1 million people, or 10 percent of the
country’s population. According to Rathe, if the government decided to achieve full coverage
with all three regimes, it would have to increase its public budget by between US$270 to US$690
million, that is, between 22 percent and 56 percent of the public health expenditure in 2008. This,
she thinks, is possible since it represents only 7 percent of the public budget approved for 2010.

The main obstacle in implementing the
CSR for informal workers is the difficulty               Figure 20 Dominican Republic: Population Covered and
                                                                     Not Covered as of June 2009
inherent in the collection of contributions.
One proposed solution is the elimination                                               (number of people and percent)
of the CSR; the inclusion of all poor                                      6,000,000

insurance status of working-age individuals by employment category, the author analyzed data
from the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey, which included a special module about
employment of men and women, and also asked about health insurance coverage of each
household member. Table 5 reports some results pertaining to the type of employment of
working-age individuals who declared having worked in the preceding month and identified their
health insurance coverage.

Employed individuals represented 55.0 percent of respondents (first column of table 5) and
included both formal and informal workers. The self-employed, together with domestic and
unpaid family workers, represent 38.4 percent of the respondents and may in their majority have
been informally employed. Overall, health insurance coverage was 31.3 percent (second column),
with broad variations by occupational category. Employed individuals had the highest rate of
insurance coverage, 40.9 percent, while the lowest rates occurred among domestic workers, the
self-employed, and unpaid family members. Two-thirds of those declaring they were employed
were in the CR and one-third of the SR. Opposite proportions occurred among the self-employed,
domestic, and unpaid family workers. Thus, some employees, who in their majority may have
been informal, qualified as poor and were covered by the SR, while most of the presumed
informal were in the SR, as well.

In 1994, a major reform of the health system, known as Ley 100 (Law 100), sought to achieve
UHC through SHI by creating two regimes, a Contributory Regime (CR) for the nonpoor and a
Subsidized Regime (SR) for the poor. Affiliation in the CR was mandatory for dependent and
independent workers whose monthly income was greater than the minimum legal salary (MLS)
or twice the MLS, respectively. Affiliation to the CR involved a monthly contribution equal to 12
percent of the worker’s salary. For dependent workers, this contribution was split between the
employee (4 percent) and the employer (12 percent), whereas independent workers had to finance
the full 12 percent themselves. The salary or income subject to the 12 percent contribution was
capped at 20 times the MLS. Individuals who did not qualify for the CR because they had no
income or their income was below the legal threshold had to enroll in the SR. Benefits in the CR
were self-financed, with 11 percentage points of the affiliates’ contributions. Benefits in the SR
were financed with 1 percentage point contributed by the affiliates of the CR plus subsidies from
the nation’s treasury.

Initially, the SR had a benefits package that was substantially smaller than that of the CR. The
original plan, however, was that the SR’s benefits package would progressively grow to equal
that of the CR by 2000 (figure 21). That plan did not come to fruition, and the two benefits
packages remained different until 2012, when the government implemented a measure to make
them equal (see below).

Colombia’s reform made it possible to achieve UHC by 2009 (see panel A of figure 22).
Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that SHI coverage was not just nominal but that it
improved effective access to health care and financial protection against health shocks for
beneficiaries (Giedion et al. 2009). The improvements in access and financial protection made
possible through the reform are demonstrated by the marked reduction in the system’s reliance on
out-of-pocket payments as a source of health financing (panel B of the figure).

                                         Note: THE = total health expenditure.
Similarly, total per capita health expenditure in the country increased in real terms immediately
after the reform started and achieved a maximum four years into the reform. It subsequently fell
by 2009 to its starting value. These are puzzling and, if correct, encouraging results because there
is concrete empirical evidence that during these 15 years, access to health care improved for
Colombians, particularly for those in the SR, who prior to the reform had limited access to MOH
health care.

Despite its many achievements, Colombia’s health reform has encountered significant problems
along the way. First, there has been considerable evasion and elusion of contributions in the CR.
Second, public resources were insufficient to meet the reformers’ original objective of equalizing
the SR’s benefits package with that of the CR. Third, there have been a growing number of legal
suits by SHI beneficiaries who demand financial coverage for services not included in the
benefits packages of the CR and the SR.

Evasion and elusion of contributions to the CR. These took at least three forms: individuals in the
CR underreported their income to reduce their contribution to health, nonpoor individuals
misrepresented their socioeconomic status to be classified as poor and therefore qualify for the
SR, and individuals did not join the CR despite the legal mandate to do so. A study
commissioned by MOH in the early 2000s concluded that the CR was failing to collect 36
percent of its potential revenue. About one-half of this uncollected revenue resulted from failure
to affiliate by individuals who should join the CR, and about one-third from underreporting of
affiliates’ income (Bitrán y Asociados and Econometría 2001). The same study also concluded
that SHI health insurers had an economic incentive to affiliate independent workers from both the
formal and informal sectors in either the CR or SR, but, as public subsidies existed for the SR and
a risk compensation fund for both the CR and the SR, they did not have an incentive to verify the
applicants’ socioeconomic status or income. The study also concluded that large segments of the



                                                                    48
population, particularly those with informal employment, remained outside the SHI system and
chose to enroll only in the presence of an illness.

In 2007, to reduce evasion and elusion, the government decided to link workers’ health
contributions to their pension contributions. In Colombia (as in Chile), pension funds are
individual and not pooled: The amount of money individuals receive from their pension fund is
proportional to the money they put in, and therefore individuals do not have an incentive to
substantially under declare their income. In contrast, health benefits that individuals received in
the CR were the same irrespective of their declared income. By linking pension and health
payments, government was able to reduce evasion and elusion in SHI.

Insufficient public resources. The reformers’ original plan was that by 2000, six years into the
reform, the benefits package of the SR would grow to equal the benefits package of the CR. But
Colombia experienced a recession in the late 1990s, the first in decades, and this prevented the
government from raising enough tax revenue to achieve this objective. After the recession ended,
however, public resources remained insufficient to accrue the SR’s benefits package, or rather,
competing public priorities diverted resources. An additional problem contributed to the
postponement of this policy: CR beneficiaries filed legal suits demanding coverage for benefits
excluded in the official benefits package. (This problem is discussed next).

The role of the judicial system in granting health benefits. In the late 1990s, beneficiaries of CR
invoked their constitutional right to health protection in legal courts; they demanded coverage for
benefits left out of the official benefits package, . The judges systematically granted the benefits,
and the number of legal suits has been skyrocketing since. The cost of financing these
extracontractual benefits eroded the finances of health insurers and the SHI system. This is one of
the main reasons the Colombian system is about to be reformed once more.

In 2012, the government implemented a measure to equalize the benefits packages of the two
regimes by expanding the contents of the SR package (see figure 21). Some experts think this
will threaten the financial stability of the system as people will be more likely to misrepresent
their socioeconomic status to qualify for the SR.

Despite the many achievements of Colombia’s health reform, the government of President Santos
is currently designing a major reform to the health system to create a unified health system. It is
said that health financing would primarily come from general revenue sources and that payroll
contributions may be reduced or eliminated altogether. Colombia therefore seems on the path to
moving away from an SHI model toward a national health system. Brazil made a similar switch
in 2000 by abolishing the country’s SHI system and implementing the new Unique Health
System (Sistema Único de Saúde), which is universal and financed from federal, state, and
municipal taxes.

of health care to public providers. By
the end of 2010, about one-third of Peruvians was covered by SIS.

Formal sector workers represent about one-fifth of those employed and must by law enroll with
the social security institute known as EsSalud, which operates its own network of health care
providers and delivers services at no direct cost to its beneficiaries. It self-finances with a 13
percent payroll tax, which is split between health and pension. Formal sector workers can opt out
of EsSalud and redirect a fraction of their contribution to private SHI insurers known as Health
Promoting Enterprises (Empresas Promtoras de Salud, EPS) to obtain ambulatory health care
from the private sector while maintaining the right to free-of-charge hospital care from EsSalud
providers.

High-income individuals can buy private insurance and health care. Those with private health
insurance accounted for 5.6 percent of the population in 2010, a percentage that has remained
rather constant in recent years.

Between 2004 and 2010, the proportion of uninsured Peruvians dropped from two-thirds to one-
third. To judge this trend it is indispensable, however, to assess what exactly is covered by each
of these insurers. This is discussed further below in this section.

Informal sector workers, whether employees or self-employed, represent three-fourths of Peru’s
labor force (Gamero-Requena and Carrasco, circa 2012). They can voluntarily enroll with
EsSalud. It is estimated that EsSalud has 50,000 voluntary enrollees and their dependents, while

15. Families in poverty may receive cash subsidies in their own bank accounts; due to a faulty assessment process,
this disqualifies them from joining SIS.


                                                       50
the national population of nonpoor independent workers and their families is 38 percent of the
population, or about 11.4 million people. Thus, voluntary enrollment in EsSalud by informal
sector workers is negligible. Workers in microenterprises should have been covered by EsSalud,
but EsSalud management felt it would be too difficult to collect contributions from this group and
too risky to insure it, given frequent work turnover. Thus, it transferred the responsibility to SIS.

To promote SIS enrollment by microenterprise workers, the government subsidizes
approximately one-half of what would be the regular premium, or 20 nuevos soles per family per
month (US$7.91). Average SIS monthly expenditure per beneficiary is 40 soles (US$15.80).
Independent and informal sector workers can also join SIS’s Semi-Contributory Regime by
paying the same 40 soles per family per month. The SIS’s Semi-Contributory Regime has a mere
7,000 beneficiaries, also a negligible proportion of Peru’s 11.4 million independent workers and
their family members.

In 2009, Congress passed a reform known as the Universal Health Insurance Law (Ley de
Aseguramiento Universal en Salud), which mandated the provision by all insurers in the country
of a benefits package known as the Essential Health Insurance Plan (PEAS), mentioned above. Its
actuarial cost of US$107 exceeds average spending by MOH but is similar to the average benefits
received by SIS beneficiaries.


                                              5.16. MEXICO 16

Prior to the 2003 reform, which created the System of Social Protection in Health (SSPH),
Mexico’s health system was segregated and presented large inequalities in both health insurance
coverage and access to health services. Formal private sector workers and their families were
affiliated with and received health protection from the Mexican Institute for Social Security
(IMSS), while federal public workers were covered by the Institute for Social Security and
Services for Civil Servants (ISSSTE). In 2002, prior to the reform, 38.7 million Mexicans were
covered by social security, representing 37 percent of the total population (table 6). Affiliation in
social security for these workers was mandatory. Health services for them were delivered mainly
by providers managed by their social security institutions.

Funsalud); and from the cited references on Mexico.


                                                       52
In addition, about 1.8 million Mexicans were covered by voluntary private health insurance and
obtained health care mainly from private providers. The rest of the population, or approximately
64 million people (61 percent of the population), had no explicit health insurance coverage
(Knaul et al. 2012). Informal sector workers and their families represented about one-half of
Mexico’s population, or 52 million people (International Labour Organization, no date). They
were part of the 64 million uninsured Mexicans who relied heavily on health care providers from
MOH.

In 2004, when the reform began, there was a large imbalance in the amount of public financing
available for health. The 38.7 million Mexicans insured through social security obtained health
services worth US$209 per person per year. In contrast, the 64 million uninsured Mexicans
obtained on average health services worth US$102 per capita per year. 17 The ratio between these
two figures was 2.0.

The SSPH reform sought to expand health insurance coverage in the country to improve access to
explicitly guaranteed, quality health services and enhance financial protection for health. With
the reform, individuals not covered by mandatory social security can enroll with Seguro Popular,
or Popular Health Insurance, a health insurer financed mainly through general revenue resources
from the federal and state governments. Enrollment with Seguro Popular calls for a premium that
is determined according to the level of household income. It has exclusions of preexisting
medical conditions and covers a broad package of health services known as the Universal Health
Services Catalogue (Catálogo Universal de Servicios de Salud, CAUSES). In addition, it covers a
list of high-cost medical interventions centrally paid by the Fund for Protection against
Catastrophic Health Expenditures (still very limited, it does not yet include chronic renal failure,
many cancers, and other high-cost diseases, for example).

Workers not covered by mandatory social security can also enroll in Family Health Insurance
(Seguro de Salud para la Familia, SSFAM), a mechanism created in 1997 and managed by
IMSS, through which workers without a work contract can obtain health insurance coverage for
themselves and their families by paying a monthly premium (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro
Social 2012). SSFAM coverage can be acquired individually or collectively (for example, for all
the workers of an informal sector firm) and calls for an age-adjusted premium per person that is
set by law. The SSFAM premium is higher than that of Seguro Popular, but SSFAM confers
better coverage. In theory, SSFAM does not cover preexisting health conditions (when
membership is individual), but in practice it has not been easy for IMSS to limit access. Since
there is high adverse selection in SSFAM, this insurance program is in deficit, and the IMSS has
tried not to promote enrollment. In light of IMSS’s financial problems, this agency is currently
discussing the possibility of implementing a flexible premium policy (that is, removing this
definition of the law) and even closing the SSFAM and transferring its beneficiary population to
Seguro Popular.

By the end of 2010, Seguro Popular covered 43.5 million people and SSFAM covered 600,000
(table 6). The uninsured population had dropped to 9 million people (from 64.4 million in 2002),
representing only 8 percent of the nation’s population.

The absolute amount and the distribution of public financing changed with the reform and
reduced the financing gap between those insured through social security and the rest of the
population, which was insured through Seguro Popular or uninsured. In 2010, the resources
available for those insured outside of the social security system had doubled in PPP dollars
relative to 2004 (table 7). The per capita spending ratio within and outside of social security had
dropped to 1.2, meaning that the value of services delivered through social security was only 20
percent greater than the volume delivered outside of it. This figure is in stark contrast with that
registered in 2004, when social security services doubled in value compared to those received by
citizens not covered by social security.

Financing of SSPH comes from three sources: (1) a so-called social quota established by the
federal government for each individual covered by Seguro Popular, equal to 3.92 percent of the
minimum legal salary and updated yearly according to the consumer price index plus a so-called
solidary federal contribution equal to 1.5 times the social quota; (2) a contribution made by state
governments equal to one-half of the social quota; and (3) contributions made by the affiliates of
Seguro Popular. The relative importance of the third financing source is very small. Between
2004 and 2011, it represented less than 1 percent of all SSPH financing, while sources (1) and (2)
represented over 99 percent of it. Table 8 presents the sliding premium scale for Seguro Popular.

Chile relies on SHI to provide health coverage to its 17 million people. A 7 percent payroll
contribution for health is mandatory for all formal sector employees and will be mandatory for all
citizens starting in 2018. 19

Most countries that have adopted the SHI model to achieve UHC took an incremental approach,
first enrolling civil servants and formal sector workers, and later, informal workers and the poor.

Fonasa or an Isapre is therefore US$140.

health services mostly through public providers (figure 27); and several for-profit private insurers
(Isapres) that cover about one-sixth of the better-off population and provide services almost
exclusively in the private sector. The remaining population is covered by the armed forces or
other systems.

The law makes it possible for Isapres to engage in risk selection through denial of coverage.
Fonasa, instead, does not reject applicants. It covers those that qualify as poor (called the
“indigent”), through a sophisticated means test, and fully waives any premiums and copayments
for them. It also covers nonindigent workers, who have to contribute 7 percent of their income
(up to a ceiling) and who must make variable copayments in proportion to their income. As a
result of Isapres’s risk selection, Fonasa has a beneficiary population that not only has lower
incomes than that of Isapres but also one that is older and sicker. 20 One out of three Fonasa
beneficiaries is the “indigent” and his or her family (also known as “Group A” beneficiaries), and
two-thirds are contributing affiliates and their families (Groups B, C, and D).

A study of work informality published in 2010 estimated informal employment using various
data sources from 2003 to 2006 and found that it represented 36 percent of the labor force
(Perticara and Celhay 2010). More recent estimates made by this author, based on the 2009
National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (locally known as CASEN) indicate that
informality may have fallen to about 20 percent, a finding that is consistent with Chile’s
sustained economic growth of the last several years.

Data from the 2009 CASEN show that monthly household per capita income by informal sector
workers equals Ch$155,741 (US$327) and is one-third lower than the per capita income for
formal sector workers (panel A of figure 28). The majority of informally employed workers are
insured through the public insurer, Fonasa (panel B of the figure), and about one-half of them
qualify as indigent with Fonasa (Group A in the figure). 21 Only a very small share of informal
sector workers is uninsured (labeled “None” in panels A and B of figure 28). This share is similar
to that of other citizens without health insurance.




20. The Isapre sector is currently in crisis because the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Court have declared
illegal the practice by which Isapres adjust its premiums over time based on beneficiaries’ age and gender. Reforms
to overcome this problem are currently being discussed in the Congress.
21. Income figures include subsidy transfers that various government social programs made in cash to households.

As already mentioned, all SHI beneficiaries covered by Fonasa and Isapres have the right to the
same minimum benefits package, with standardized coverage for 80 priority health problems
(figure 29). In addition, all Fonasa beneficiaries can have access to additional health services with
public providers, but their access is not guaranteed and is instead rationed through queues.
Contributing beneficiaries of Fonasa (Groups B, C, and D) also benefit from a voucher provided
by Fonasa that covers part of the cost of health care obtained from private health providers. This
additional benefit of Fonasa, not available for Group A, is highly valued by beneficiaries and is a
feature that confers incentives for individuals with an ability to make the 7 percent contribution to
belong in groups other than Group A.

Informal workers represent a sizable and in places majority share of the labor force in developing
countries. Informal employment has been growing or is stagnant, except in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where it is falling. While over the long term informality may shrink as economies expand, in the
decade or two ahead, work informality will remain large.

Finding a solution to the problem of providing informal workers with health insurance is a major
policy challenge that governments will have to tackle if they want to deliver on the promise of
achieving UHC.

In developing countries, there appear to be more informal sector workers than there are people
below the poverty line (International Labour Organization 2012). A comparison of these two
indicators for the eight case study countries of this report supports this finding (). In the poorest
case study countries of Ghana, Cambodia, and Vietnam, labor informality is between two and
three times greater than poverty, implying that a sizable share of the population that is informal is
not poor. Providing health insurance to them is a large problem because of the sheer size of the
non-poor informal. Reluctance by these individuals to voluntarily enroll in health insurance and
to make a contribution implies that significant public resources will be required to cover them
with a benefits package that comprises quality health interventions and confers adequate financial
protection.

different groups. Information from Chile
illustrates this distinction. Figure 31 shows that informal sector workers are rather evenly
distributed across all five income quintiles. Quintile 1 more or less coincides with poverty in the
country, which by recent account is 15 percent. Only about one out of three working persons
below the poverty line is informal and two out of three are not. In Chile, most of the informal are
nonpoor. Still, as was shown in this country’s case study (figure 28), virtually all informal sector
workers and their families belong to Fonasa, the large public insurer, and about half of them
manage to get into Group A, reserved for the indigent. Thus, most of the indigent in this country
end up receiving a large public subsidy to cover their health care costs through insurance.

This report has reviewed a vast set of country experiences in the provision of health insurance to
the informal. It has shown that the problem has been addressed in a variety of circumstances and
with multiple approaches. Still, some important findings, patterns, and lessons emerge. They are
discussed below.

Countries that until recently were distant from UHC are rapidly moving in that direction. China is
a prominent example, given the speed with which it has expanded population coverage and the
government’s resolve to spend public resources to provide coverage for the poor and the nonpoor
informal, both in urban and rural areas. Ghana and Vietnam have also made great strides toward
UHC. But in these countries, while there is evidence that greater insurance coverage has
improved access to health services for the poor and the nonpoor informal, it has not yet improved
financial protection for these target groups. In China and Vietnam, the reliance of government
health systems on user-fee revenue, combined with inefficiency, waste, and perverse incentives
conspire against the goal of improving financial protection. The mere injection of additional
financing in countries such as these will not suffice to improve performance and to move closer
to UHC. A broad set of reforms will also be required to strengthen the supply side to ensure that
additional public financing does translate into improved coverage.

A recent comprehensive review of the literature on the impact of the Mexican reform commonly
known as Seguro Popular has also come to the same conclusion. Mexico has made considerable
progress toward UHC. For example, available financing for the population outside of social


                                                        60
security has increased in an important way in the last ten years: in 2004, the amount of health
money spent outside of social security represented only half of that spent within social security;
in contrast, around 2010, that proportion had fallen to 90 percent. Despite this and other
important achievements, ten years into the Mexican reform, out-of-pocket health spending has
stubbornly remained at around 50 percent. Knaul et al. concluded that “mobilizing additional
funds to extend health insurance coverage is a necessary but not sufficient condition to expand
access to comprehensive health care and decrease reliance on OOPS. Translation of additional
financial resources into regular access to comprehensive, effective health services — the ultimate
goals of effective universal coverage — is a formidable task. Until universal access includes a
guaranteed, acceptable level of quality, the egalitarian exercise of the right to protection of health
will remain an elusive goal and inefficient OOPS will grow” (Knaul et al. 2012).

Part of the little or lack of progress made by some countries in improving financial protection
likely responds to limitations in the breath of covered services or in the extent of financial
coverage of services. For example, in Vietnam, out-of-pocket payments by informal sector
workers with insurance are not capped, and public providers demand high informal payments.
Improving financial protection there will probably involve dealing with the reasons that public
providers charge user fees, and adopting measures to expand the insurer’s financial coverage.
Chile’s experience in this respect, with the Regime of Explicit Health Guarantees (Régimen de
Garantías Explícitas en Salud), AUGE reform, may be a relevant solution to examine. In that
country, a broad benefits package has been legally defined as a set of disease-treatment pairs. To
limit citizens’ OOPS, the law also offers a guarantee that caps OOPS at a proportion of monthly
household income. In addition, a time limit has been built into the law for health conditions in the
benefits package such that if the public insurer fails to respond to demand for covered services
due to constraints in public supply, it is forced to purchase the services from a private provider to
protect the beneficiary’s right to coverage and keep him or her from having to purchase needed
health care out-of-pocket from private providers.

In Mexico, the Fund for Protection against Catastrophic Health Expenditures (FPCHE) covers
costly and specialized health interventions. It began with coverage of four diseases in 2004 and
was covering 57 interventions by 2011. It is likely that the further expansion of the breadth of this
package will help lessen the financial burden of health care on the covered population. But other
interventions may be required to improve the quality and timeliness of health care providers.
Identifying these interventions and best practices to expand effective financial protection of
coverage expansion efforts is an important policy research priority.

In some countries, enrollment by informal workers into health insurance schemes has been slow.
That is the case in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Peru, and to some extent Vietnam. This
phenomenon appears to have multiple causes. The existence of a Ministry of Health that
continues to provide universal access to fully subsidized health services, however limited in
quality and availability, constitutes implicit insurance on which uninsured informal citizens rely
to obtain needed health services, particularly from hospitals. Limiting free access to government-
subsidized health services for the nonpoor may be a way of inducing them to enroll in health
insurance.

But doing so may be politically controversial and hard to achieve in the absence of effective
mechanisms to identify the poor and the nonpoor. Strong means-testing procedures are required


                                                 61
for this, as is a political will, since such a measure may in some countries be deemed
unconstitutional or unpopular, at best. Latin American countries such as Chile, Colombia, and
Peru rely on means-testing procedures developed for social protection programs, in general, or
for health protection, in particular. In Chile and Colombia, government hospitals require the
beneficiary to produce a health insurance card, and those that do not have the card are subject to
an on-site means test to determine if they are eligible for a partial or total exemption.

Many countries have sought to collect revenue from nonpoor informal workers in exchange for
health insurance coverage. None of them has managed to collect a significant amount of
resources, where significance refers to the share of the contribution relative to the costs of
coverage. As noted, in Vietnam a premium subsidy as large as 70 percent is insufficient to induce
all of the informal to obtain health insurance. In China, the subsidy appears to be much larger,
and the government is increasing it further.

It is worth asking what the rationale is for charging an enrollment premium to informal sector
workers. Several authors question the wisdom of charging small premiums not only because the
revenue they bring in is small and the premium’s existence may inhibit enrollment, but also
because the administrative costs of collecting the premium may be comparable in magnitude to
the revenue. In China, it has been argued that the role of the premium is in part to promote a
sense of ownership and empowerment by the insured. But there may be another reason for the
premium collection policy. Its existence may diminish the incentive for formal sector workers to
leave formal employment and become informal. The evidence cited in this report supports this
notion.

The adoption of differential benefits packages for different population groups may also be a
rational policy design to avoid perverse incentives in the health insurance system. If all
population groups — the poor, the nonpoor informal, and the nonpoor formal — receive exactly
the same benefits package, this gives rise to incentives for the nonpoor to misrepresent their
status and qualify as poor, or for the formal to leave formality and become informal. Thus, to
avoid these perverse incentives, not only should contributions differ between these groups, but so
should benefits packages.

The notion of offering different health insurance coverage to different population groups tends to
be opposed by health policy makers, who believe that such a policy promotes inequality and
inequity. However, offering a uniform benefits package for all, just like offering free enrollment
for the poor and the nonpoor informal alike, may result in such large perverse behaviors that the
aim of achieving UHC may become infeasible. The recent announcement by Colombia’s
president to equalize the benefits packages of the contributive and subsidized regimes will
undoubtedly confer greater incentives for beneficiaries to misrepresent their socioeconomic status
or to switch to informality to capture exactly the same coverage at no cost.

But in addition, the choice of benefits package for different population groups has fiscal
implications. In most developing countries it is not fiscally possible for government to subsidize
a vast, uniform benefits package for all, and it is not convenient to offer a modest package for the
non-poor because they may be reluctant to enroll. China, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico
are useful examples of countries that have by design made the decision to offer different levels of
benefits to different population groups. With time, as fiscal resources and formality increase,


                                                62
benefits may be progressively improved for the lower-income population. In contrast, Peru’s
decision to have a single, large benefits package for all citizens is beyond the financial abilities of
its government and of the technical capabilities of the health care delivery system. Likewise,
Colombia’s decision to equalize the benefits package of the two regimes seems at odds with the
country’s failed efforts to do so for the last 20 years.

Community-based health insurance (CBHI) has been promoted by governments and the
international community on the grounds that it is a mechanism that can improve accessibility to
needed services and financial protection for poor people, particularly in rural areas of low-income
countries. The evidence available suggests that CBHI is a step forward and advances these
objectives. However, with the exceptions of Ghana and Rwanda, most poor countries where
CBHI has developed have been able to cover a small share of the population, and since most
initiatives have been isolated and spontaneous, the scaling up of CBHI has not occurred at a rapid
pace. Further, while poor populations have been shown to have a willingness to pay a premium
for CBHI, outside financial resources have been required for most of these schemes. Also, the
majority of these schemes promote voluntary enrollment and are therefore subject to considerable
adverse selection. Finally, because of their generally small beneficiary populations, CBHI
schemes fail to reach the minimum size required to achieve effective risk pooling, hence the need
for reinsurance promoted by Dror and Jacquier (2001) and Dror (2001). In sum, this author does
not view CBHI as an effective way of achieving UHC except where governments actively
promote the rapid scaling up of CHBI by making the appropriate financial allowances to
subsidize these schemes from general revenue resources at the national level and by adopting a
regulatory framework for health insurance.

This last point has been promoted by several authors who have studied health insurance
initiatives in poor countries, including Bennett, Creese, and Monasch (1998). While government
promotion of basic functions and rules for local health insurance initiatives is desirable from a
policy perspective, if initiatives are left unregulated, government intervention in this domain can
result in problems too. This is clearly illustrated in the case of the government of India’s
regulatory framework for health insurance, which Dror (2007) suggested was seemingly faulty.

India is a country where CBHI has thrived, providing many communities with a needed
mechanism to improve access to health care by lessening the financial burden on the patient’s
family. Offering technical and financial support to these schemes should remain an important
priority for the development community. But the sudden development of a new scheme, the
GSHISs, seems to offer a prospect for faster and possibly more effective escalation toward UHC.
These new, larger insurers cover the poor only, and that may include a significant share of
informal sector workers.

While GSHISs are not devoid of problems and therefore are not a panacea in India, they signal a
shift in the policy paradigm in the world’s second largest country, by systematically channeling
public funding to large, organized risk pools that purchase health services on behalf of their
beneficiaries. It remains to be seen how GSHISs will evolve and what their performance will be.
Also, their total dependence on government financing leaves them vulnerable to the fluctuations
of government revenue along economic cycles. Still, if these initiatives continue to expand and to
show positive results, they may become India’s way of moving toward UHC and constitute an
example for neighboring countries to emulate.


                                                  63
Finally, the majority of country cases presented in this report are relying on SHI as the chief
mechanism for offering public insurance for the informal sector. This emphasis does not reflect
the author’s preference but rather the available literature. Some developing countries have
abandoned the SHI approach and moved to a tax-financed national health system. Thailand and
Brazil may be the most noteworthy examples.

Levy (2008) criticized Mexico’s existing social security system for formal workers and
advocated eliminating wage-based social security contributions and raising consumption taxes on
higher-income households to simultaneously increase the rate of growth of GDP, reduce
inequality, and improve benefits for workers. His prescription is at odds with the current direction
of the reform but has valid implications for Mexico and other developing countries that rely on
SHI as well. Colombia may be moving to a reformed system that relies more on tax-financed
health care and less on SHI contributions. India’s GSHISs also rely on tax financing.

Thus, in thinking about ways of providing health insurance to informal sector workers, who
represent a large fraction of the workforce or the bulk of it in developing countries, both SHI and
tax-financed systems should be considered as valid options, as well as a switch from SHI to
general tax financing where warranted.
