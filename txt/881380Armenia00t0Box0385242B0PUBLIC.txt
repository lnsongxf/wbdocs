I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Armenia
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Armenia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Armenia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Armenia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Armenia; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Armenia.
       Use data to help inform the Armenia country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In September-October 2012, 213 stakeholders of the World Bank in Armenia were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on
World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 192 stakeholders participated in the country survey (90% response
rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Armenia; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank;
the Bank’s future role in Armenia; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in
Armenia.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Sco recard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Armenia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Armenia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Armenia.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
    with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Armenia, Bank staff preparedness to help
    Armenia solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
    the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
    Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
    productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
    weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty
    in Armenia, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
    reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
    the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Armenia, the extent to which the Bank
    meets Armenia’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
    level of effectiveness across thirty-one development areas, such as economic growth,
    governance and anti corruption, job creation, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
    consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
    efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
    how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
    the extent to which Armenia received value for money from the Bank’s fee -for-service
    products.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
    a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
    “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
    on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Armenia’s institutional capacity, and
    providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Armenia: Respondents were asked to rate how
    significant a role the Bank should play in Armenia’s development in the near future and to
    indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Armenia.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
    information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
    information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website s.
    Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
    past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
    from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
    asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
    and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
    specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
    to the Bank in Armenia, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 171 respondents (90% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2005 and the 212 respondents (96% response rate) who completed the survey in FY 2003.
Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President
       and the office of the Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of
       Minister; consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects were combined
       with respondents from PMUs; respondents from private foundations were combined with
       those from NGOs and CBOs; respondents from the financial sector and private banks
       were combined with those from private sector organizations; and the few respondents
       from the office of Parliamentarian, local government, the media, and the judiciary branch
       were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no respondents from trade
       unions and faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Yerevan. Because of
        the small number of respondents from different provinces (marzer), these locations were
        combined in the “Marz” category for all further analyses.
       Responses across both geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in the Appendix C (see page 83). Only significant differences between geographic
        locations in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
     Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank received a mean rating of 7.7; this
      was statistically similar to the mean ratings received in the FY ’05 country survey (7.8) and
      the FY ’03 country survey (8.0).
            Respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank supported projects and the
             office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister indicated the highest levels of
             familiarity whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and “other”
             organizations indicated significantly lower levels.
            It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
             significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
             effectiveness in Armenia, the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and

       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across twenty-two of these thirty-one areas. For the most part, respondents from the
        office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister and independent government institutions
        had the highest ratings across these areas whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral
        agencies, NGOs/CBOs/private foundations, and academia/research institutes/think tanks
        tended to have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectivenes s across these areas.
        Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
             “Water and sanitation”;
             “Energy”;
             “Health”;
             “Agricultural development”;
             “Public financial management”;
             “Information and communications technology”;
             “Education”;
             “Public sector reform”;
             “Rural development”;
             “Gender”;
             “Economic growth”;
             “Communicable/non-communicable diseases”;

             “Climate change”; and
             “Anti-corruption”.

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across three of these
        thirty-one areas. In all three instances, respondents from Yerevan had significantly lower
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than respondents from other
        locations. Those areas with significant differences were:
             “Regulatory framework”;
             “Governance”; and
             “Natural resource management ”.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Armenia, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development result s increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Armenia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Anti-corruption;
             Poverty reduction; and
             Equality of opportunity.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Armenia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Job creation/employment;
                Economic growth;
                Anti-corruption; and
                Governance.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Armenia
        Respondents in this year’s country survey had statistically similar levels of agreement
         with all of these statements about the World Bank’s work in Armenia compared to
         respondents in the FY ’05 country survey and the FY ’03 country survey.
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement
         regarding all of these aspects of the Bank’s work in Armenia. For the most part,
         respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister and independent
         government institutions tended to have the highest levels of agreement with these
         statements, whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and NGOs/CBOs/
         private foundations tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
        Respondents across both geographic locations had statistically similar levels of
         agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
         Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower levels of agreement
          that the World Bank disburses funds promptly compared to respondents from the FY ’0 5
          country survey.
         There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement across
          four of these aspects of how the Bank operates: “The World Bank’s teams and visits are
          well coordinated”; “The World Bank effectively monitors and evaluates the projects and
          programs it supports”; “Working with the World Bank increases Armenia ’s institutional
          capacity”; and “Where country systems are adequate, the World Bank makes appropriate
          use of them”. Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister
          tended to have the highest levels of agreement with these statements whereas respondents
          from bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to have significantly lower levels of
          agreement.

The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher ratings for the Bank
        being an effective development partner in terms of straightforwardness and honesty and
        staff accessibility compared to respondents from the FY ’03 country survey. Respondents
        in this year’s country survey had significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s flexibility (in
        terms Bank’s products and services and changing country circumstances) compared to
        respondents from the FY ’05 country survey and the FY ’03 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across all of these
        aspects, except Bank’s collaboration with the Government and follow ing through over
        time. For the most part, respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/
        Minister tended to give the highest ratings for these aspects whereas respondents from
        bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to give significantly lower ratings.
