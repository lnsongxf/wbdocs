 Examples of projects where such issues stand out include: urban renewal and water management projects in Hanoi, Jakarta, and Manila in
the East Asia and Pacific region; relocation of squatter settlements in Mumbai in the South Asia region; mass transportation projects in Brazil
in the Latin America and the Caribbean region; and a toll road and solid waste management project in Dakar in the Africa region.

 According to the latest IPCC reports, rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events are likely to affect coastal urban areas
around the world. “Nearly two-thirds of cities with more than 5 million people are located in low elevation coastal zones, which contain 13
percent of the world’s population” (Glaeser and Joshi-Ghani 2013, 10, drawn from McGranahan, Balk, and Anderson 2007).

 It should be noted that over the years a number of issues have arisen related to the poor quality of construction of high rises built by private

 According to a 2004 World Bank resettlement supervision report for El Mina (World Bank 2004b), compensation for loss of housing was
increased to 50,000 MU ($US200 in 2003) and compensation for transportation costs was increased to 20,000 MU ($US80 in 2003), enabling
more resettled households to apply for subsidized housing credits under the Twize program.

 According to the resettlement action plan (2000), vulnerable people included disabled people, people suffering from serious illnesses, and
elderly persons. Assistance to be provided included moving assistance; building assistance; and health care as needed during the moving and
transition period.

 According to the El Mina sourcebook produced for the UDP task team (World Bank 2007a), there were only 30 complaints registered during
the El Mina resettlement program, and these were all promptly resolved.

 According to an independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation study conducted in 2007 for the World Bank, the second census
revealed that a total of 31 households identified in the 2000 census were no longer living in the slum, while another 21 households that
had been omitted in the 2000 census were registered as households to be resettled. Another 40–50 households settled in the area after the
resettlement cut-off date and were considered ineligible for compensation and relocation to the resettlement site. However, these households
were given assistance in finding other living sites in the El Mina slum by the ADU.

  According to the RAP (AMEXTIPE 2000), although land attribution policy in Nouakchott is guided by social principles, with land occupation
permits as cheap as US$0.25 per square meter, land speculation is taking place on a large scale on the outskirts of the city. The poorest people
tend to sell the land occupation permits awarded to them by the government and remain squatting in kebbes and gazras, a practice that
is widely tolerated. By law, land that remains unoccupied and undeveloped is supposed to revert back to the public domain, but this is not
enforced and much titled land remains devoid of either occupation or development.
