World Bank’s Commercial Aviation Modernization Projects, 1956
and 1957

Qantas Empire Airways
Modernization Project

The loan (0155) from the World Bank
for the Qantas Empire Airways
Modernization Project amounted to
$9,230,000 and was signed on
November 15, 1956. At that time
Qantas was undertaking large
expenditure in order to cope with traffic
growth, maintain its competitive
                                                   Qantas Airways Jet Liner, 1959
position, and improve its earning power.

The project was aimed at assisting Qantas Airways in carrying out its re-
equipment and expansion program. The major components of the project were
equipping a fleet with most of the propeller craft replaced on the main routes by
faster, larger jets operating at lower unit costs and providing essential ground
facilities for the new craft and the enlarged fleet.

Air India Jet Project

One year later, another loan
(0161) financing modernization of the
air industry was signed on March 5,
1957 for the Air India Jet Project. This
loan was provided to Air India, the
Indian-flag carrier on world routes. Air
India carried about two thirds of the
passenger traffic between India and
overseas, and had a flight network of
22,100 route miles. However, Air India
needed more aircraft to cope with
                                              Air India International VT-JN Boeing 707,
growing traffic, and to maintain its                             1960
business share on international routes.

The project included the purchase of three jets powered by 12 original engines;
radio, galley, and other aircraft auxiliaries; 9 spare engines; other initial spares
and stores; some overhaul facilities, a test cell and other special equipment; and
                                     a flight simulator. Air India had sufficient
                                     equipment by 1960/61 for flying 120 million
                                     capacity ton miles a year compared with 42
                                     million actually flown earlier.
