     Benefits of a regional approach:




     1. Reduces duplication by allowing a single

     regional research institute to undertake work

     that otherwise would be done in parallel by

     multiple institutions;




     2. Helps capture economies of scale by

     concentrating resources, where they can

     achieve critical mass;




     3. Increases payoffs to research by facilitating

     dissemination of improved technologies across

     national borders and increasing number of

     beneficiaries; and




     4. Mitigates isolation and silos by creating

     effective mechanisms for facilitating knowledge
