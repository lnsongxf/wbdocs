                             Executive Summary
From March 2013 to August 2013, the South Sudan Law Society (SSLS), with the support of the
World Bank, conducted a comprehensive assessment of land governance in South Sudan. The
research was structured around the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF), a tool
developed by the World Bank and its partners to evaluate the legal framework, policies and
practices relating to land governance in a given country. The assessment focused on seven thematic
areas:

   1.   Legal and Institutional Framework;
   2.   Land Use Planning, Land Management and Taxation;
   3.   Management of Public Land;
   4.   Public Provision of Land Information;
   5.   Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management;
   6.   Large-scale Acquisition of Land Rights; and
   7.   Forestry.

The seven thematic areas are subdivided into 28 indicators and 108 dimensions. The indicators and
dimensions were assessed through a series of nine panel discussions with in-country experts.

This draft report summarizes the main findings of the LGAF study. After Chapter One’s
introduction to the economic, social and political context, Chapter Two provides an overview of the
LGAF methodology. Chapter Three summarizes the LGAF results across the seven thematic areas
along with the LGAF scores and associated findings for each of the 108 dimensions. The final
chapter provides concluding remarks and a list of policy options for Government authorities and
their development partners to consider in their attempts to build a more functional system of land
governance in South Sudan.

Legal and Institutional Framework (LGI-1 to LGI-6)

South Sudan’s underdeveloped legal and institutional framework reflects the difficulties that the
country has faced in establishing effective governance and rule of law institutions after decades of
conflict. Although significant legislative reforms have been made since the end of the war in
2005—including the passing of the 2009 Land Act and the 2009 Local Government Act—the laws
remain largely unimplemented. Most land governance institutions operate according to procedures
developed in the colonial era, and there is a wide divergence between law and practice. Bridging
this gap has been one of the most difficult challenges of the postwar period. Institutional
arrangements are also undermined by poor coordination among formal institutions at each level of
government (horizontal overlap), between the three levels of government (vertical overlap) and
between the formal and customary systems.

The ambiguous and unpredictable legal framework makes it difficult to develop standardized
approaches to tenure formalization. Rudimentary processes are in place to formally register
landholdings in urban areas, but aside from a few pilot efforts, the registration process has not yet
been extended to landholdings in rural areas. Demand for land in urban areas has increased sharply
since independence, and the registration process has not kept pace. The expense and inefficiency of
the system prevents many people who have lived in Juba for decades from formalizing their rights
and pushes newcomers into informality. Corruption and misgovernance further undermine the
integrity of the registration process. Women’s access to land is severely restricted in both formal
and informal systems, though there is some regional variation and women with financial means
have been able to obtain registered plots in some urban areas.

Land Use Planning, Land Management and Taxation (LGI-7 to LGI-11)

Land use planning and land management processes are underdeveloped or non-existent throughout
most of South Sudan. Land use plans in urban areas have reportedly been developed in some
locations, but they are not made available for public review. Different institutions often develop
their own land use plans independently from one another and without consultation. In several cases,
political changes in institutions have caused one set of partially implemented land use plans to be
exchanged for another. This leads to a great deal of uncertainty in planning and management
processes and perpetuates a more general lack of confidence in land governance institutions.
Somewhat paradoxically, timeliness of decision-making is not always a problem, as can be seen in
the relatively short period of time it takes to obtain a building permit. However, this may reflect a
lack of demand more than the efficiency of the system per se. In reality, many if not most new
structures in South Sudan are built without building permits.

Land-related tax systems have not been established yet in South Sudan. The lack of progress on this
front may be indirectly related to the abundance of oil wealth, in that when oil is flowing, state
governments are able to survive on transfers from the national government and do not feel the
urgent need to develop their own sources of revenue. Unfortunately, the converse is also true; when
oil production is interrupted, as happened in January 2012, state governments have very little
revenue to buffer them from the effects. The development of a property tax system based on land
values could help to diversify revenue sources and moderate the government’s dependency on oil.
Devolving tax administration to the lower levels of government could also help to better link tax
revenue to public services.

Management of Public Land (LGI-12 to LGI-15)

Governance institutions in South Sudan suffer from a lack of accurate information, poorly defined
roles and responsibilities relative to one another, and systematic financial and human resource
constraints. These shortcomings are evident in the manner in which land expropriations have been
conducted in recent years. The Government expropriates land for various purposes: to facilitate
public and private investments in agriculture, forestry and other land-based sectors; to provide
housing to newly arriving returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs); to accommodate urban
expansion and make land available for residential, commercial and industrial purposes; and to
promote urban development.

Expropriations in urban areas are often accompanied by evictions and demolitions. Though the
government has reportedly made some improvements in its procedures in recent years, when the
urban development process began in 2009, demolitions were carried out with little or no notice and
little or no compensation for affected individuals and groups. Tens of thousands of people were
affected in the first few months alone. People without documents proving ownership over a
particular plot of land are often not given compensation, regardless of how long they have resided
in the area. Opportunities to challenge evictions are too expensive and out of reach for most of those
affected. People also routinely complain that government officials managing the process engage in
self-interested deals and other forms of corrupt activities. The demolitions started in Juba in 2009,
but have since spread to most urban centers in the country and even to some rural areas. Neither the
Government of South Sudan nor international organizations have been monitoring the issue in a
comprehensive manner.

Public Provision of Land Information (LGI-16 to LGI-19)

Land administration systems in South Sudan are confronted with huge challenges. Not only must
they sort out the many overlapping claims resulting from the war, but they must also cope with
rapidly increasing demand for land. Antiquated procedures and poor information management
systems make the task all the more difficult. In many cases, information in the registry is out-of-
date or otherwise inaccurate. Documents are handwritten and stored in poor conditions where they
are subject to deterioration and damage from the elements. Only the most basic information about
landholdings is recorded, such as the identity of the owner, the number of the plot, a sketch of the
plot, and a standard lease agreement. Information regarding encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens
or pending lawsuits, is not included in the registry. Nor are secondary rights recorded.

Land information systems also suffer from a severe lack of transparency. The registry is not open to
the public and it is difficult to access information without hiring an intermediary. Access is only
granted for information pertaining to people that can demonstrate ownership over the plot in
question. The 2009 Land Act sought to remedy some of these failures by moving the registry from
the Judiciary where it is currently housed to the RSS Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning
(currently the RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning), but four years after the Act
came into force these changes have still not been implemented.

Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management (LGI-20 to LGI-21)

Courts in urban areas of South Sudan are inundated with land disputes. Experts estimate that land
disputes comprise as much as 80 to 90 percent of civil cases in the formal system. Typical disputes
include allegations of land grabbing by security sector personnel, competing claims over ownership,
double allotment of plots to individuals during the formalization process, land acquisitions for the
purposes of urban expansion, and various disputes involving groups of IDPs and returnees. Appeals
are not handled in a timely manner and judges often will adjudicate appeals based on the lower
court’s findings without notifying the disputing parties or giving them an opportunity to present
their positions. Enforcement of court decisions can also present insurmountable obstacles,
particularly when decisions are made against individuals who hold military or political power.

The problems are exacerbated by gaps between the statutory (more formal) courts and customary
(more informal) courts. The formal Judiciary has not fully established itself and has limited reach in
rural areas. While customary courts and other forms of dispute resolution are available in areas
where statutory courts do not exist, there are serious concerns about the extent to which women and
children’s property rights are protected in the customary system. Forum shopping between the
multiple overlapping mechanisms of dispute resolution is commonplace. On the one hand, the
prevalence of forum shopping gives rise to a marketplace for justice, in which complainants are able
to ‘vote with their feet’ and select the forum that best suits their purposes. But it also places
defendant parties at a disadvantage, since they never can be fully assured that a final judgment has
been issued or whether the case will be resurrected in another forum.

Large-scale Acquisition of Land Rights (LSLA)

Since the end of the war in 2005 and independence in 2011, South Sudan has experienced a surge in
private investment. Land-based sectors are seen as particularly desirable, in that they offer the
country an opportunity to diversify its economy away from its dependency on oil. The land
acquisition process, however, is poorly structured and there is little clarity on the applicable
procedures. Investment agreements are signed at all levels of government, irrespective of the size of
the landholding. Rarely are affected communities consulted in any meaningful manner. Information
tends to be asymmetrical; not only do community landholders not have the information necessary to
                                                  3
                                                                                                DRAFT
properly vet investment proposals, but government institutions themselves also lack the necessary
expertise to properly vet projects. This is particularly true for carbon credit and biofuel projects.

Although most of the investments initiated in the last eight years have not progressed much beyond
the feasibility or trial stages, some disputes have already begun to surface. Communities that are
aware of deals that have been made without their approval, tend to use whatever means are at their
disposal to contest the land acquisition. Often, communities will leverage their networks to political
leaders to argue for a more inclusive approach, though instances of court action have been
documented as well.

Forestry (FGI-1 to FGI-6)

The LGAF findings suggest some progress in the forest sector relative to other land governance
sectors. The RSS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Tourism and Animal Resources, Cooperatives
and Rural Development has made steps towards ratifying many of the important treaties relating to
forest conservation, is in the process of developing a new policy and law relating to forest
governance, and has begun trial efforts to map South Sudan’s forest resources.

However, much remains to be done. Forestry directorates at the national and state level lack
resources and are unable to conduct activities in remote rural areas in a consistent and thorough
manner. Forests face threats from multiple sources, including charcoal production, unrestrained
forest fires and environmental degradation. Illegal logging, poaching and other forest crimes occur
with some regularity, and the justice system has not proven effective at capturing and prosecuting
wrongdoers. Customary rights to forests are recognized in law, but not sufficiently protected in
practice.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Land governance institutions in South Sudan are struggling to cope with the many challenges of the
post-conflict period. Increasing land values, skyrocketing demand, economic development,
urbanization, population growth, and the development of administrative units have contributed to
the growing complexity of land issues. Since it was established in 2005, the South Sudan Land
Commission (SSLC) has provided leadership on many of these issues, but as an independent
commission without representation in the Council of Ministers, the SSLC does not have the
mandate to execute the reforms called for in the Land Act.

To address this gap, the 2013 Land Policy proposed the creation of a new position of Deputy
Minister of Lands in the RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning. The Deputy
Minister would be responsible for promoting the reforms called for in the Land Act and fostering
greater coherence among land governance institutions at all levels. One of the early tasks of the new
Deputy Minister will be to develop a roadmap for tackling challenges in the land sector, including a
list of priorities and a timeframe for different activities. It is hoped that this study may provide some
useful insights in this regard.

The following three policy priorities have emerged from the LGAF study in South Sudan:

1.    Clarify Principles Governing Community Landownership

The manner in which community landownership is defined under South Sudanese law is among the
most contentious issues pertaining to land governance in South Sudan. The 2009 Land Act grants
customary land tenure equal force in law with freehold and leasehold rights. However, there is a


                                                   4
                                                                                                DRAFT
great deal of uncertainty about what rights communities enjoy vis-à-vis the state and how the
formalization of customary land rights is to be managed in practice.

At its most basic level, the definition of community landownership is a question of applicable law.
The Land Act states that all land that is not community or private land shall be deemed to be public
land. To the extent that there is no terra nullius (‘no man’s land’) in South Sudan and communities
claim ownership over virtually all parts of the country in the sense that they retain the right to
regulate its usage under customary law, it is not clear to what land this provision in the Land Act
applies. There is therefore a need to explicitly state the limits, if any, that the government will place
on community ownership claims under customary law and the process that will be used to
determine legitimate landholders.

Aside from the definitional question, reforms must also address the many related systems that will
need to be created or reformed in order to provide formal recognition for customary land rights. A
system for surveying, demarcating and registering community land rights will have to be
established. Land use mapping processes will have to be developed to identify community
landholdings. The process will need to incorporate a conflict management system to address the
disputes that are bound to arise as a result of the formalization process. Mechanisms for protecting
the rights of marginalized populations, including women and children, internally displaced persons
(IDPs) and minority groups must also be provided for. Until these issues are sorted out, differing
conceptions of community landownership will continue to present an obstacle to developing land
governance systems.

2.    Pilot Initiatives to Develop Land Administration Systems

Efforts to develop South Sudan’s land administration system should focus on three key areas: (1)
modernizing land registration processes and improving their transparency, accountability and
sustainability; (2) establishing systems of land use planning at the national and local levels; and (3)
clarifying the principles, rules and procedures governing land expropriation and improving
institutional accountability in the process.

Land registries in South Sudan require urgent attention to limit potentials for self-interested
dealings and corruption. A plan should be designed to modernize information management systems
in the land registries, correct inaccurate and fraudulent information, promote greater transparency,
and establish a national land register. The role that communities play in formalizing landholdings in
urban and peri-urban areas must also be clarified. As a first step, the RSS Ministry of Lands,
Housing and Physical Planning should work to build the necessary political will to implement
reforms through direct engagement with state-level Ministries of Physical Infrastructure and State
Secretariats. The reform of land registries can begin with pilot projects in preselected locations in
which existing information in the registries is checked against bona fide landholders on the ground.
The pilot projects can then inform efforts to upscale the exercise to cover registered lands in urban
areas throughout the country.

Land use planning processes must also be strengthened. The development of the Town and Country
Planning Act called for the 2013 Land Policy can help to galvanize efforts in this regard, but a first
step would be to take stock of all the land use mapping activities that have taken place. Pilot
initiatives should then be developed to test different land use planning systems at the national and
local level.

With respect to land expropriation, additional oversight is required to ensure that people’s rights are
respected in the process. Linkages to the judicial system will be particularly important to ensure that
the applicable rules are being following, including the provision of adequate notice, fair and prompt

                                                   5
                                                                                            DRAFT
compensation and alternative resettlement. Civil society organizations can help to raise awareness
about people’s rights under South Sudanese law and improve access to the justice system for
affected individuals and groups. They should also make a concerted effort to monitor demolitions
and forced evictions more closely and regularly report on the numbers of people affected.

3.   Conduct Further Research on Priority Issues and Refine LGAF Findings

Since the end of the war in 2005, the Government of South Sudan and its development partners
have implemented a variety of programs relevant to land governance. There is a need to compile the
lessons learned from these past projects, determine where gaps arise and develop plans for up-
scaling interventions to the national level. Additional research is also needed to better understand
and document issues in the land sector. Issues that warrant additional attention from researchers
include: comparative research on land in constitutional and legislative frameworks, the role of
traditional authorities in land governance, typologies of land-related conflicts, existing land
registration processes, and the circumstances in which expropriation takes place.

Additional research could also be conducted to refine the LGAF findings, promote the use of
relevant LGAF indicators in the monitoring the implementation of law and policy, and provide
baselines from which to assess the impact of development interventions. In order to more fully
develop and substantiate the LGAF results, future LGAF studies could make a more concerted
effort to gather regional data from the Greater Upper Nile and Greater Bahr-el-Ghazal regions.
Studies could be conducted on areas designated for specific development projects, such as areas
designated for oil pipelines or transit corridors. LGAF indicators could also be assessed in border
areas to better understand and monitor the land issues that arise with respect to border demarcation
and cross-border movement of transhumant populations.

                                    Chapter One:
                        Land Governance in South Sudan
Land is indispensible to livelihoods in South Sudan. Daily survival for the vast majority of South
Sudanese depends on their ability to access land for smallholder agriculture, livestock rearing or
residential purposes. Shifting population dynamics in the post-war period have heightened the
importance of land. Millions of South Sudanese have returned to the country from elsewhere in
Africa and the world since the end of the war in 2005. These returnees often arrive with few
resources to provide for themselves and their families. Accessing residential land is among their
first priorities. South Sudan also hosts hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
who have had to flee their homelands due to insecurity or natural disaster. Their ability to access
land from host communities is a primary concern.

Considering the importance of land in the new nation, institutions of land governance appear
severely underdeveloped by comparison. Land administration systems are not able to satisfy user
demand and people are increasingly being pushed into informality. The interface between
customary and statutory systems of land tenure is unclear, generating conflict and undermining
efforts to establish effective institutions. Land use planning activities are non-existent throughout
much of the country. Land ownership is poorly defined and tenure insecurity is a systematic
problem. Courts are inundated with land disputes and their ability to enforce judicial decisions are
hampered by political interference and poor coordination with other government institutions. New
and complex land issues have surfaced since the end of the war in 2005 and independence in 2011.
Building strong and efficient institutions of land governance is an integral component of peace- and
nation-building efforts.

The subsections below outline relevant aspects of the political, social and economic context and
provide an overview of land governance in South Sudan.

1.1    Political, Social and Economic Context

The newly independent nation of South Sudan is a landlocked country in northeastern Africa.
Among South Sudan’s defining features is the Nile River, which cuts across the country on its way
north to Sudan and Egypt. South Sudan has a geographical land area of 644,329 square kilometers,
but it is sparsely populated, with population estimates ranging from 8.26 million to 10.84 million
(SSCCSE 2010; World Bank 2012). South Sudan’s population density of 12.82 people per square
kilometer places it among the less densely populated countries in Africa. Compared to its southern
neighbor Uganda, for example, South Sudan has about one-third the population spread across a land
area that is almost three times as large.

Another defining feature of South Sudan is its long history of conflict, including two successive
civil wars since Sudan’s independence from British colonial rule in 1956. The second civil war
(1983-2005) resulted in an estimated two million people killed and four million displaced (Haken
and Taft 2013). The destruction to human lives and infrastructure, coupled with decades of neglect
under colonial and postcolonial administrations, has left a legacy of underdevelopment, hunger and
poverty. The statistics are sobering: There are only about 300 kilometers of paved roads spread
across a country the size of France (Laessing 2013). Roughly half of the population is considered
food insecure, with one million people severely food insecure (FSC 2013). Only 27 percent of the
population age 15 or older is able to read and write.



                                                 7
                                                                                                  DRAFT
According to the World Bank (2013), South Sudan’s economy is the most oil dependent in the
world. Ninety-eight percent of fiscal revenue is derived from oil. Oil accounts for almost all
exports, and approximately 80 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) is directly or indirectly
derived from oil. This oil wealth gives rise to a deceptively high per capita GDP. Preliminary
estimates for 2011 indicate a GDP per capita of US $1,858, which is much higher than South
Sudan’s East African neighbors. Very little of this wealth, however, trickles down to the average
citizen. A 2009 survey by the Southern Sudan Centre for Census, Statistics and Evaluation (SSCSE
2010; Uma 2012), for example, found that more than half of the population lives below the poverty
line, defined as those living on $1.25 per day or less.

South Sudan’s precarious economic situation became painfully apparent in 2012, when the
Government of South Sudan halted oil production over a dispute with Sudan about oil revenues and
fees associated with the use of Sudan’s pipeline to the Red Sea. Overnight, the government of South
Sudan lost 98 percent of its projected revenue, and the economies of both countries were sent into
turmoil. The International Monetary Fund (De Waal 2013) estimated that South Sudan’s GDP
contracted by 55 percent in 2012, one of the largest contractions ever recorded. To compensate for
revenue losses and inflation, the Government of South Sudan put in place a series of austerity
measures in February 2012. Non-salary spending was cut by 50 percent and unconditional grants to
state governments were eliminated. Civil servants also faced job cuts, incentive schemes were
frozen, and housing allowances were trimmed by 50 percent.

Despite the poor development indicators, South Sudan has an abundance of untapped natural
resources that can be used to promote development and post-conflict reconstruction efforts. Ninety
percent of South Sudan’s land area is considered to be suitable for agriculture, with 50 percent
considered prime agricultural land. A land cover mapping exercise by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) (2010) found that only four percent of South Sudan’s land area is being
actively used for crop production, suggesting an opportunity to increase food production by
expanding land areas under cultivation, although the figure does not appear to take into
consideration some less visible types of land use, such as the practice of shifting cultivation in
which farmers cycle through plots of land over the course of several years.

South Sudan’s forests—which are thought to cover 29 percent of the country’s land area—provide a
number of public goods for local populations, including land for grazing, hunting and gathering of
forest products. They host a variety of valuable tree species, such as teak, mahogany and ebony, and
protect important ecosystems that have relevance throughout the region. The Sudd (Arabic for
‘barrier’), one of the world’s largest wetlands, covers more than 8,000 square kilometers of South
Sudan, and often extends to several times this area depending on seasonal and annual variations in

                                                    8
                                                                                              DRAFT
the river discharge and the intensity of rainfall (Ahmad 2008). These seasonal floods sustain vast
grazing lands, which are essential to the livelihoods and economies of South Sudan’s pastoralist
communities and are of central importance to regional development programs, such as the Nile
Basin Initiative. The thick vegetation in the Sudd also provides important habitats for an array of
migratory animal species.

In terms of non-renewable natural resources, there are large oil deposits scattered across the country
and considerable, though as yet unexplored, mineral resources, including copper, gold, tin, and
uranium. Proven oil reserves, however, are rapidly diminishing. According to current estimates, oil
production from existing fields is expected to reduce steadily in future years and become negligible
by 2035 (World Bank 2013). Mineral resources could eventually provide an alternative source of
revenue. Communities that trade gold in informal cross-border markets derive some benefits from
artisanal mining, but the country is not yet generating substantial revenue from industrial mining
(Deng 2013). In the short-term, land-based investments in non-extractive sectors such as
agriculture, forestry and carbon credits provide the most attractive means to diversify South Sudan’s
economy away from its unhealthy dependence on oil.

The challenge is to attract capital to the country and promote responsible and sustainable investment
without undermining livelihoods in the process. Seventy-eight percent of households rely on crop
farming or animal husbandry as their primary source of livelihood (SSCCSE 2010) —access to
secure supplies of land and water is indispensible to these populations. There is also evidence to
suggest that smallholder farming and cattle-rearing activities themselves contain hidden economic
potential. South Sudan has the world’s highest number of livestock per capita, with approximately
11.7 million heads of cattle, 12.4 million goats and 12.1 million sheep. According to Martin Elia
Lomuro (2012), the former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the pre-independence
Government of Southern Sudan, this livestock wealth has an estimated asset value of roughly two
billion U.S. Dollars (USD).

System of Governance

South Sudan has three levels of government: national, state and local. Local government is further
subdivided into the county, payam and boma administrations, with the payam and boma
corresponding roughly to the district and village levels, respectively. There are ten states and 79
counties in South Sudan.

The Government of South Sudan has aspects of both a unitary (or more centralized) and federal (or
more decentralized) system of governance. Characteristics that suggest a unitary government
include:

      The role that the national government plays in many public sectors that would be managed
       primarily at the state or local level in a federal system, such as health, education and law
       enforcement;
      The centralization of the Judiciary under the administration of the Supreme Court in Juba;
      The fact that state Governors report directly to the President;
      The President’s power to remove elected Governors during states of emergency that threaten
       national security and territorial integrity;
      The national government’s ownership of all subterranean natural resources and states’
       dependency on transfers from the national government for revenue.

Nonetheless, state governments do enjoy a degree of independence within what is otherwise a
centralized system. With respect to land, for example, state governments have been able to use the
principles of decentralization and subsidiarity in the Transitional Constitution to assert their rights

                                                  9
                                                                                               DRAFT
to control their own land and natural resources. This has been particularly apparent with regard to
urban land issues. Although urban development, planning and housing is a concurrent competence
over which power is to be exercised by both the state and national government, in practice, urban
lands are managed primarily at the state level. This gives state governments and municipalities a
considerable degree of power and influence in urban areas.

In rural areas, the situation is somewhat more ambiguous. The Transitional Constitution grants the
national government power over land owned by the national government and the state governments
power over land owned by the states. In practice, however, there is a great deal of disagreement
about which level of government owns a particular area of land and disputes among the levels of
government are commonplace.

Resource Constraints

The Government of South Sudan suffers from human resource gaps and chronic underfunding
across all sectors and at every level of government. The Government was established in 2005 with a
bloated civil service in which government positions were seen as an important peace dividend that
could help to stabilize society and discourage spoilers from undermining the fragile peace. As a
result, a disproportionate amount of public funds go towards salaries for public sector personnel and
little is left over to fund operational activities. Public officials routinely complain that they do not
have the vehicles and fuel necessary to effectively manage public land, particularly in remote rural
areas.

These problems have been compounded by the government’s austerity measures following the oil
shutdown in 2012. According to the RSS Ministry of Roads and Bridges, for example, the
Ministry’s budget dropped from roughly $50 million USD in 2012 to $7.5 million USD in 2013.
The Ministry has reportedly sought to fill the budget shortfalls through public private partnerships
and loans from various sources, but with little success. Other Ministries have experienced similar
constraints.

Government institutions are also sorely lacking in qualified staff. South Sudan has few specialists
on land administration and the government is heavily reliant on international support to provide the
necessary expertise in land matters. Government institutions are also using antiquated systems of
land governance that are not able to accommodate the complex land issues that have arisen in the
postwar era. The state-level Ministries of Physical Infrastructure, for example, the institutions with
primary responsibility over land in urban areas, have not yet computerized their record-keeping
systems and still maintain land information in handwritten records. The risk of damage resulting
from exposure to the elements, fire or theft is high.

Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Returnees and Refugees

Large-scale population movements as a consequence of war, hunger and natural disaster have been
a characteristic feature of South Sudan for many years. An estimated four million people were
displaced by the civil war; some fled to live as refugees in other countries and others sought refuge
in elsewhere in Sudan. Eight years after the end of the civil war, South Sudan continues to
experience high levels of displacement. At the end of 2012, there were an estimated 111,000 IDPs,
203,000 refugees, and more than two million returnees living in the country (RI 2013).

Displaced populations face a complex array of land issues. Their survival depends on their ability to
access land for residential and agricultural purposes, but they often come into competition with host
populations over access to land and natural resources. The large-scale acquisition of land rights for
private investment and development purposes also poses potential risks. A proactive urban planning

                                                  10
                                                                                              DRAFT
process could help to provide additional options for IDPs and returnees, but the failure to implement
the Land Act and the delays in adopting the Land Policy have frustrated attempts to reform land
governance institutions in urban areas. In the absence of viable options, displaced populations have
no option but to settle in informal settlements in and around urban areas, where they are susceptible
to repeated displacement as a result of land use changes and forced evictions.

1.2    Land Governance in South Sudan

The lengthy civil war and decades of neglect under colonial and post-colonial administrations have
undermined land governance in South Sudan. More than eight years after the end of the war, food
and human insecurity remain at conflict levels in parts of the country. The Government of South
Sudan and its international partners continue to focus their time and resources on providing
humanitarian relief. The more development-oriented aspects of land, including the development of
systems of land administration and land use planning, have received less attention than issues
relating to food security, land-related conflict and access to land for displaced populations. Certain
reforms have been introduced to the institutional and legislative framework in recent years, but due
to weak rule of law and human and financial constraints, they have had a limited impact on
prevailing practice.

2009 Land Reforms

Pre-2005 national land legislation in Sudan was based on the colonial model, which strongly
favored state ownership of land. The Anglo-Egyptian Condominium put in place laws creating a
rebuttable presumption that unregistered land was state property. The 1905 Land Settlement
Ordinance, and its successor, the 1925 Land Settlement and Registration Ordinance, both stipulated
that, “waste, forest, and unoccupied land shall be deemed to be the property of the government,
until the contrary is proved.” In 1970, the Nimeiri regime took the state ownership of land one step
further with the Unregistered Land Act, declaring that all unregistered land of any kind, occupied or
unoccupied, belonged to the state and was deemed to be registered in the name of the state. Since
rural land areas in South Sudan were almost completely unregistered, the Unregistered Land Act
effectively eliminated any legal claims that communities may have had to their ancestral
homelands.

When the regionally autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was established in 2005, there
was a degree of uncertainty as to whether these national laws that southern Sudanese considered to
be oppressive would continue to be enforced in southern Sudan. To address the legal uncertainty
and provide a legal foundation to the ideas espoused in the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) and the 2005 Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan (ICSS), the Southern Sudan
Legislative Assembly passed three key pieces of legislation in 2009: the Land Act, the Local
Government Act, and the Investment Promotion Act.

The Land Act reinforces the government’s recognition of customary land tenure in the CPA and the
ICSS, stating, “Customary land rights including those held in common shall have equal force and
effect in law with freehold or leasehold rights…” It allows community land to be allocated for
investment purposes so long as the investment activity “reflect[s] an important interest for the
community” and “contribute[s] economically and socially to the development of the local
community.” The Land Act also requires that state authorities provide approval for land acquisitions
above 250 feddans (105 hectares), and calls for regulations to be put in place that prescribe a ceiling
on land allocations.

Both the Land Act and the Local Government Act require that the government consult with local
communities and take into consideration their views on decisions related to community land. The

Land Act gives special protection to pastoralists, stating that, “no person shall without permission…
carry out any activity on the communal grazing land which may prevent or restrict the residents of
the traditional communities concerned from exercising their grazing rights.” It also requires project
proponents to conduct environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) prior to engaging in
any activities that might affect the people or the environment. Upon completion of the investment,
the Land Act states that leased land “shall revert back to the community.”

Though the Land Act allows for long-term leases of up to 99 years, the Investment Promotion Act
explicitly limits foreign investments in agriculture and forestry to renewable terms of 30 and 60
years, respectively. Assuming that leases constitute investment property and can therefore be
considered to be investments in their own right, any foreign-owned agricultural lease longer than 30
years and any foreign-owned forestry lease longer than 60 years would thus be inconsistent with
this provision of the Investment Promotion Act. Due to the poor uptake of these laws, however,
many government institutions in South Sudan are not aware of this restriction and 99-year leases for
foreign investments in agriculture and forestry are not uncommon (see section 3.6 below).

Land Classifications in the Land Act

The 2009 Land Act classifies all land in South Sudan as public, private, or community land. Public
land includes various forms of government property, including:

      Land for government facilities;
      Transport corridors;
      Urban parks and recreational areas;
      Forest reserves, wildlife reserves and national parks;
      Certain wetlands and waterways; and
      A number of pre-war agricultural schemes and agro-industrial complexes.

Private land includes land held by individuals in freehold or leasehold. Although the Land Act
recognizes freehold as a valid form of ownership, there is currently no land held in freehold
anywhere in South Sudan. As a result, private land consists entirely of leaseholds in which primary
ownership rests with state governments. Most of these leaseholds are situated in urban areas for
residential or commercial purposes.

Community land refers to land held under customary land tenure. There is no terra nullius, or ‘no
man’s land’, in South Sudan. Communities, defined mainly in terms of ethnic groupings or
subgroupings, own virtually all land in the country in the sense that they retain the right to regulate
its usage according to their own particular customary land tenure system (Rolandsen 2009). South
Sudan is home to about 65 ethnic groups whose territories span the entire country. Customary land
tenure systems vary across the country. Some groups, such as the Shilluk, incorporate more
centralized systems of land governance. The Shilluk are led by the Reth (Shilluk King), who has a
greater deal of authority over decision-making on land issues than many other traditional authorities
in South Sudan. Other customary land tenure systems adopt more decentralized structures, in which
authority is distributed among several institutions of traditional authority in the community.
Another line of distinction can be broadly drawn between groups that practice different livelihood
approaches, such as groups that adhere to primarily agriculturalist or pastoralist lifestyles.

Under customary tenure, access to land is seen as a ‘social right’ and serves an important safety net
for populations residing in rural areas. Land is typically assigned to families and their descendants
in perpetuity. In that sense, identity plays a role in determining one’s land rights. People belonging
to a certain ethnic group have a right to access land within that group’s territory. However, the fact
that peoples’ land rights depend so heavily on their identity can also restrict individuals and groups

                                                  12
                                                                                             DRAFT
from outside the community from settling on community land. There is a long history of identity
politics revolving around land issues being used as a tool of divide-and-rule in South Sudan. The
role of identity in determining land rights also has implications for internally displaced persons
(IDPs) and refugees. IDPs and refugees are commonly permitted to settle temporarily on
community lands if they have a good reason for leaving their homelands, but there is usually an
explicit condition that once the cause of their displacement subsides, they will return to their home
areas.

Another concern with customary land tenure relates to the manner in which it treats women’s rights.
The Transitional Constitution and the Land Act include provisions that purport to protect women’s
land rights. Nonetheless, many customary systems continue to restrict women’s ability to own land
independently of their husbands or male relatives. The risks of landlessness are particularly acute
for divorced women. Upon divorce, women are often denied a share of family wealth and property,
even if that property was obtained after marriage. If the husband’s family has paid the full
bridewealth (typically in the form of cattle) to his wife’s family, a divorced woman may also be
denied custody over her children. When divorced women’s birth families decline to accept them
back into the family home, the women may be left with nowhere to go. This insecure tenure status
may also make it difficult for women to flee abusive relationships, since if they divorce their
husbands they often stand to lose all their property and can even be denied custody of their children.
Most customary law systems include mechanisms to provide for widows, but in practice, the
families of their deceased husbands often dispossess widows of their lands, even when doing so is
not in accordance with customary law (SIHA 2013).

Land Tenure Typology

Table 2 below provides an overview of a Land Tenure Typology for South Sudan. The leftmost
column indicates the three land classifications that are recognized in South Sudanese law: private
land, public land and community land. These classifications are further broken down into various
formal and informal tenure types that are found in urban and rural areas. The final column provides
information on the characteristics of the tenure types, including the extent to which they are legally
recognized, recorded and transferable.

* The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has categorized all land in South Sudan as urban or rural for the purposes of the national census that was conducted in 2008. All state
capitals are considered urban areas, as well as a number of the more developed county headquarters. The rest of the land in South Sudan is considered rural. Precise figures for the
areas of urban and rural land are not available, but the 2008 census found that 87 percent of the population resided in rural areas and 13 percent resided in urban areas.

Institutional Framework

Responsibility for land governance is distributed across a range of institutions at all levels of
government. The South Sudan Land Commission (SSLC) is an independent institution that was
established in 2005. It has been the driving force behind the Land Act and Land Policy and has
provided leadership on land issues over the past eight years. However, as an independent institution
without representation in the Council of Ministers and with a limited presence at the state level, the
SSLC does not have the mandate to execute the reforms called for in the Land Act.

Other national level institutions—such as the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development, the Ministry of Wildlife,
Conservation and Tourism, and the Ministry of Roads and Bridges—each deal with their own
particular types of land issues, but do not cover the whole range of governance challenges that arise
with respect to land.

The main locus of decision-making for most land issues resides at the state level. State Governors,
Ministries of Physical Infrastructure, and Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry are key players in
this regard. However, there is poor coordination between institutions at various levels of
government (vertical overlap) as well as between institutions within each level of government
(horizontal overlap), which undermines performance and gives rise to a considerable number of
disputes among government institutions.

The Land Act has also created several new institutions at the local government level that are meant
to eventually take primary responsibility over land matters. The County Land Authorities (CLAs)
and Payam Land Councils (PLCs) have only been established in a handful of areas, but as discussed
in greater detail in Section 3.1, competition among interest groups over the composition of the
CLAs are already causing political squabbles to emerge in various locations.

2013 Ministerial Reshuffle

In July and August 2013, the President of South Sudan restructured the Ministries in the national
government, introducing several changes relevant to land governance. The RSS Ministry of
Housing and Physical Planning was changed to the RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical
Planning. This restructuring would seem to be in line with the 2013 Land Policy, discussed in
greater detail below, which identified the Ministry of Housing as the primary institution mandated
to deal with land issues in South Sudan.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development also had animal
resources and tourism added to its portfolio. This consolidation now makes the RSS Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry, Tourism and Animal Resources, Cooperatives and Rural Development a
central institution for land-based investments outside of the extractives sector.

Until the new ministries have become better established it is not possible to determine exactly how
the restructuring will impact on land governance in South Sudan. Since the LGAF was conducted
before the reshuffle was announced, this study maintains references to the preexisting ministries,
with cross-references to the new ministries, when appropriate.

Land Policy Development

South Sudan is preparing a number of policies relating to land issues that are in varying stages of
development, including a Land Policy, Housing Policy, Forest Policy and Environmental Policy.
The South Sudan Land Commission (SSLC) began work on the Land Policy in 2006. Workshops
and citizen dialogues were held in each of the 10 states to gather citizen input on the issues to be
addressed in the policy. The policy provides for a number of legislative reforms to be conducted in
tandem with institutional development efforts. The SSLC formally handed a draft of the Land
Policy to the RSS Ministry of Justice in 2012, but the policy was not formally adopted by the
Council of Ministers until February 2013. The policy now awaits final approval by the National
Legislative Assembly (NLA).

One of the major institutional changes called for in the Land Policy is the creation of a new Deputy
Minister of Lands to be housed within the RSS Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. The
Deputy Minister of Lands would be responsible for addressing the issue of land in its entirety and
would help to counteract the piecemeal approach that flows from having land issues distributed
across so many different ministries.

The Land Policy also calls for a series of new legislation to be passed to fill many of the gaps in the
legal framework. Table 4 list the proposed legislation:

                           Table 4: Legislation Proposed in the 2013 Land Policy
   Proposed Legislation                                                Description
 Community Land Act             The Community Land Act would clarify the distinction between public and
                                community land, describe the rules and procedures governing the expropriation of
                                community lands, describe applicable standards of women’s rights under customary
                                land tenure, and describe land administration systems for community lands.
 Town and Country               The Town and Country Planning Act would provide an appropriate framework for
 Planning Act                   preparation and implementation of national, regional and local area land use plans
                                and ensure the planning process is integrated, participatory and meets stakeholder
                                needs.
 Land Survey Act                The Land Survey Act would clarify rules, procedures and institutional roles for land
                                survey and mapping activities. The Act would also provide for the use of modern
                                technology, such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Geographical
                                Information Systems (GIS), and streamline survey authentication procedures.
 Land Valuation Act             The Land Valuation Act would set standards for land valuation.
 Land Registration Act          The Land Registration Act would describe a land registration process that recognizes
                                and protects all legitimate rights and interests in land in all categories.

                                                                                                         DRAFT
 Land Information Act       The Land Information Act would facilitate access to and management of land
                            information.
 Mortgage Act               The Mortgage Act would lay out a regulatory system for property mortgages.

Before passing the new legislation, the Land Policy calls for the existing laws to be reviewed and
harmonized with one another and with the Transitional Constitution. Any such review would also
have to take into consideration any relevant changes that might be introduced in the process of
developing South Sudan’s Permanent Constitution. There is currently no timeline in place for when
these legislative reforms might take place.

Additional efforts are also required in developing implementing regulations for both the existing
and proposed legislation. Whereas the legislation lays out the general framework of the law, the
implementing regulations provide detailed guidance for institutions on how to apply the law. The
delay in finalizing the regulations for the Land Act may be one reason for the confusion about how
to proceed with implementing the changes called for in the legislation.

The adoption of the Land Policy is a sign of progress after many years of delay, but one document
alone cannot exhaustively address the myriad of land issues in South Sudan. There is a need for
additional more targeted policies—such as a policy on women’s land rights, land acquisition and
land information management—to more clearly describe the status quo with regard to these issues
and the government’s plans to remedy any shortcomings.

Constitutional Development Process

The manner in which the issue of land is treated in the constitutional development process will be a
central factor in determining how South Sudan’s legal framework tackles land issues in the years to
come. At independence in 2011, South Sudan put in place a Transitional Constitution, replacing the
Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan, which had been in force since the end of the war in 2005.
At the end of a transitional period, the country is meant to adopt a permanent constitution. The
length of the transitional period is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred from several
provisions of the Transitional Constitution to last for four years, from July 9, 2011 to July 9, 2015.

On January 9, 2012, the President of South Sudan established the National Constitutional Review
Commission (NCRC), a body of 55 individuals with the mandate to review the 2011 Transitional
Constitution, carry out civic education on constitutional issues, and collect the views and
suggestions of South Sudanese on what they would like to see in their new constitution. After the
NCRC submits the draft constitutional text to the President, he will then convene a National
Constitutional Conference (NCC) to deliberate on the draft text and endorse it by a simple majority
vote. Once the NCC has passed the draft text, the President will table the text before the National
Legislature for adoption. Under the current schedule, the NCRC should complete its work by
December 31, 2014, and a new constitution should be adopted by 2015.

                                       Methodological Note
2.1 What is the LGAF?
The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is a diagnostic tool developed by the World
Bank and its partners to help evaluate the legal framework, policies and practices relating to land
governance in a given country. The assessment is based on a recognition of the increasingly
important role that land governance plays in helping countries address the challenges posed by
climate change, urbanization, disaster prevention and increased demand for land. The LGAF
assesses these issues in an integrated manner and provides a basis for monitoring progress in the
land sector over time.

The core of the LGAF focuses on seven thematic areas:

    1.   Legal and Institutional Framework;
    2.   Land Use Planning, Land Management and Taxation;
    3.   Management of Public Land;
    4.   Public Provision of Land Information;
    5.   Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management;
    6.   Large-scale Acquisition of Land Rights; and
    7.   Forestry.

These seven thematic areas are subdivided into 28 indicators and 108 dimensions. The indicators
and dimensions are assessed through panel discussions with in-country experts.

2.2 LGAF in South Sudan
The LGAF in South Sudan began in March 2013. The South Sudan Law Society (SSLS)
coordinated the study with support from World Bank staff in Juba and Washington, D.C. The
process began with a series of investigations into various land governance issues. Information
compiled over the course of these investigations was used to develop detailed briefings to inform a
series of nine panel discussions (see Table 5).

                    Table 5: List of Panel Discussions and Corresponding Themes

Each panel discussion brought together 3 to 7 experts on the particular issue to assess the relevant
dimensions, arrive at a consensus score for each dimension and brainstorm potential policy options.
Panelists included representatives from the Government of South Sudan, donor countries, private
sector, civil society, think tanks, academia, national and international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and United Nations agencies. A list of the experts that participated in the
LGAF panel discussions is included in Annex III.

In September 2013, a workshop was held with stakeholders in Juba to validate the LGAF findings
and discuss potential policy options. The report was then revised taking into account stakeholder
viewpoints and feedback from a panel of external reviewers prior to publication.

2.3 Understanding the Results
In order to organize expert input and ensure a comprehensive and consistent analysis across
indicators, the LGAF uses a scorecard to summarize South Sudan’s performance in each area of
land governance (see Annex II). Scores for the 108 LGAF dimensions were determined as
consensus decisions by panels of experts. These scores supplement the more detailed and
contextualized findings compiled during the expert investigations, panel discussions and the
stakeholder workshop.

The LGAF scores are arranged on a four-point scale from A to D. Each score is assigned a color. A
(green) indicates that South Sudan has met the requirements for good land governance, B (yellow)
indicates that South Sudan has mostly met the requirements for good land governance, C (orange)
indicates that South Sudan is struggling to meet the requirements for good land governance, and D
(red) indicates that there has been no progress or limited progress in meeting requirements for good
land governance.

In evaluating South Sudan’s current situation, the panel of experts selected from among the four
available options as presented in a ‘scoring box’. Table 6 provides a generic example of how the
scoring boxes frame each dimension. The experts then provided their analysis of the issue, relevant
sources to substantiate their analysis, the reliability of the data and a commentary on policy options.

                                  towards good land governance.
                              C – Dimension description generally struggles to meet the criteria for good land
                                  governance however some attempts are being made.
                              D – There are no attempts in this area that indicate good land governance operates.

2.4 Limitations
In interpreting the results, several limitations should be borne in mind. First, the LGAF includes
both quantitative and qualitative indicators. In some cases, particularly with respect to the
quantitative indicators, the information necessarily to generate a precise finding is not available,
either because the data is scattered across different institutions and not readily accessible, it is
treated as confidential information as a matter of government policy or practice, or it simply does
not exist. Where precise quantitative data was not available, researchers made an informed estimate
in consultation with the panel of experts. To the extent that LGAF is a longitudinal study that is
meant to assess governance institutions as they develop over time, attention should be paid to
developing more precise measurements in future iterations of the LGAF.

Second, the research for this study was done entirely from Juba. Juba is somewhat unique among
urban centers in South Sudan in that it houses several levels of government all in the same location:
the national government, the Central Equatoria State (CES) government, the Juba County
government, and the Juba City Council. Whenever possible, the researchers tried to broaden their
inquiries to include data from other urban areas in South Sudan, but there may nonetheless be some
bias towards urban land governance issues as they arise in Juba.

Finally, researchers had difficulty securing participation from women experts on land issues. Two
of the researchers were women and several women were interviewed for the study, but only two
women participated as experts in the panel discussions. A consultant was brought in to try to deepen
the analysis pertaining to gender and land rights, but it may be necessary in future studies to think
about how to secure better representation from female experts on land issues.

                                               LGAF Results
The LGAF results across the seven themes reflect the toll that decades of war have taken on South
Sudanese society and the difficulties that the Government has faced in establishing effective and
accountable institutions in the post-war period. Weaknesses in the rule of law, bureaucratic failures,
widespread corruption and a host of other challenges have frustrated efforts to develop land
governance systems that are responsive to user needs. The subsections that follow provide a
summary of the LGAF results across each of the 28 indicators and 108 dimensions.

3.1 Legal and Institutional Framework
The Legal and Institutional Framework theme assesses the extent to which governance institutions
recognize the range of existing land rights, allow enforcement and upgrading of those rights, and
are integrated into a realistic and accepted policy framework. It covers six indicators that are
assessed using 27 dimensions. The first four indicators (LGI-1 to LGI-4) examine the recognition,
enforcement and restriction of existing rights. The other two indicators (LGI-5 to LGI-6) focus on
the clarity of institutional mandates and issues relating to participation and equity in land policies.

Recognition of a Continuum of Rights (LGI-1)

Table 7 presents the LGAF results for the five dimensions relating to the recognition of rights.

                                                   are not affordable or clear, leading to widespread discretion or
                                                   failure to apply even for cases where those affected desire to so.

Rights Recognition in Rural Areas and Discrepancies Between Law and Practice

South Sudan is a new country with young and underdeveloped institutions. Although the
autonomous region of Southern Sudan had control over its legal framework for six years prior to
independence in 2011, major policies relating to land remain unfinished, including the Land Policy,
Forest Policy and Environmental Policy. There are also major gaps in the legislative framework.
The Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly (SSLA) passed the Land Act in 2009, but the legislation
is broad in scope and does not provide the level of detail necessary to govern the many complex
                                                       30

land issues facing the country. Implementing regulations could help to clarify applicable rules and
procedures, but almost five years after the promulgation of the Land Act, the implementing
regulations have yet to be adopted. The Land Act is also inconsistent with other legislation, such as
the 2009 Local Government Act, which lays out an entirely different institutional framework for
land governance.

Despite the gaps and ambiguities in the legal framework, South Sudanese law does recognize the
land rights of rural populations (see LGI-1, Dim. iii). According to the 2009 Land Act, “Customary
land rights including those held in common shall have equal force and effect in law with freehold or
leasehold rights acquired through statutory allocation, registration or transaction.” The Land Act
gives special protection to pastoralists, stating that, “no person shall without permission… carry out
any activity on the communal grazing land which may prevent or restrict the residents of the
traditional communities concerned from exercising their grazing rights.” Women’s inheritance
rights are also recognized. According to the Transitional Constitution, “Women shall have the right
to own property and share in the estates of their deceased husbands together with any surviving
legal heir of the deceased.”

However, a distinction must be drawn between rights that are recognized in law and the protection
of those rights in practice. Since the Land Act was signed into force in February 2009, it has
remained almost completely unimplemented. For several years after the Land Act was passed, no
one outside of a small group of policy-makers in Juba had access to the legislation. The
Government of South Sudan has since partnered with several international organizations to
disseminate the Land Act throughout the country, but these dissemination activities have not had
noticeable effects on institutional practice. People are not aware of their rights, courts do not apply
the Land Act, community lands are not being registered and changes that the Land Act calls for in
the roles and responsibilities of institutions are not being adhered to. To the extent that the term
‘legal recognition’ requires the recognition of people’s land rights in law as well as their protection
in practice, South Sudanese law at best only partially recognizes the land rights of rural populations
(see LGI-1, Dim. i).

The failure to implement the Land Act can be attributed to a number of factors, the foremost of
which is the manner in which the legislation was introduced. Initially, there was a great deal of
disagreement over whether a Land Act could be passed in the absence of a Land Policy, the idea
being that the policy had to first be developed to lay out the key issues that would be addressed in
the law. After several years of wrangling, it was decided to enact the Land Act as a provisional
piece of legislation, with the understanding that it would be amended after the Land Policy was
adopted. As a result, many policy-makers view the Land Act as non-binding and choose not to
apply it, despite the fact that it went through the formal legislative process and should carry the full
weight of law.

Rights Recognition in Urban Areas

Land rights in urban areas are managed exclusively through leaseholds with the state government.
As such, they fall under the jurisdiction of statutory law and customary law does not apply—there is
no community land in urban areas. While the legal framework recognizes the rights of people with
formally registered leases, there is far less protection for those residing in informal settlements, or
residential areas in which landholders have not registered their rights through any formal process.

Statistics are not currently available about the number of registered (or formal) landholdings in
urban areas compared to the number of unregistered (or informal) landholdings, but panel experts
estimate that more than 50 percent of the urban population resides on unregistered land (see LGI-1,
Dim. ii). Existing registration processes such as those discussed in relation to LGI-3 below are able

to formalize some urban landholdings, but the processes are not able to meet the demand and people
continue to be pushed into informality.

Survey, Demarcation and Registration of Community Lands in Rural Areas

By recognizing customary land rights as having equal force in law with freehold and leasehold
rights, the Land Act makes a first step towards the formalization of customary land tenure. The Act
recognizes customary land rights whether or not they have been formally registered, but it also lays
out a process for surveying, demarcating and registering community lands. If followed through
upon, the registration of customary land rights can help to improve tenure security for rural
communities as they struggle to cope with new pressures on community lands, such as those
associated with urban expansion, increasing land values, the exploitation of natural resources,
environmental degradation and the large-scale acquisition of land rights for public or private
purposes. However, as is the case with most of the changes called for in the Land Act, the survey,
demarcation and registration of community lands has not yet begun and there are no plans in place
for how to go about it (see LGI-2, Dim. i and Dim. ii).

Aside from the non-implementation of the Land Act discussed above, one central obstacle to the
registration process lies in the definition of the term ‘community’. ‘Community’ can carry a number
of different meanings in the South Sudanese context. It can refer to tribal distinctions, such as the
Dinka, Toposa, Azande or Jurchol communities; inter-sectional distinctions, such as the Dinka Bor
and Dinka Twic or the Lou Nuer and Jikany Nuer; inter-clan distinctions, such as the distinctions
among the various subgroups of Lango in Ikotos county; or geographical distinctions, such as
between the Pojulu living in Kenyi payam and the Pojulu living in Mukaya payam. The Land Act
appears to endorse a territorial definition of community:

             [Local Community] means a group of families or individuals, living in a circumscribed territorial area at the
             level of a locality, which aims at safeguarding their common interests through the protection of areas of
             habitation, agriculture, whether cultivated or fallow, forests, sites of cultural importance, pastures, and area of
             expansion.

                                                                32
                                                                                                            DRAFT

The main problem with using the term ‘community’ in the development of law and policy is that it
implies a well-defined and cohesive unit, whereas in reality, communities are often fractured and
ambiguously defined entities. Communities may host displaced populations or minority groups who
have lived on community land for generations. Divisions may exist between recent returnees and
people who remained in the community during the war, host communities and neighboring
communities who enjoy rights of access for grazing, fishing or gathering forest products, or
permanent residents and economic migrants. Even if a semi-cohesive community can be identified,
customary institutions have been undermined by the lengthy civil war. Community leaders are often
ill equipped to manage new and complicated land governance issues and the system may be
susceptible to self-interested decision-making, elite capture and misgovernance. This greatly
complicates efforts to develop law and policy for community lands.

Registration of Individually Held Land in Urban and Rural Areas

As in relation to LGI-1, Dim. ii, panel experts estimated that less than 50 percent of individually
held land in urban areas was registered (see LGI-2, Dim. iii). In the smaller towns, this figure is
even lower. For example, in Terekeka, a small town on the banks of the Nile about 85 kilometers
north of Juba, small-scale demarcation activities were carried out in 1997, 2008 and 2013, but the
majority of individual landholdings are not registered.

In rural areas, communities own almost all land in their collective capacity. This land is not
registered. However, there are often small marketplaces and slightly more developed residential
landholdings that may be registered in some form. This registration process is far less developed
than that found in bigger towns and cities and usually consists of little more than a ledger book
recording the landowners name and an associated plot number.

Women’s Rights in the Registration Process

South Sudanese law affords women equal rights to own land as men. The 2011 Transitional
Constitution states, “Women shall have the right to own property and share in the estates of their
deceased husbands together with any surviving legal heir of the deceased.” This provision is
mirrored in the 2009 Land Act. However, these protections are routinely violated in practice.
According to the 2013 Land Policy:

       Despite the existence of legal provisions recognizing the equal rights of women to land, widespread
       knowledge, recognition and protection of those rights, remains limited throughout South Sudan. Women’s land
       rights remain largely conditional, derived through their marital or childbearing status and dispossession of
       widows, daughters, and divorced women is common. There is tension between competing notions that
       customary rules and practices should adapt to changing socioeconomic circumstances and those who resist
       change, fearing its impact on tradition and cultural identity, leading to a significant gap between the law and
       practice, particularly in rural areas.

Panel participants maintained that land administration systems in urban areas allow for land to be
registered in the name of women, though the forms that are used do not appear to allow for joint
registration. In Juba, for example, several panel participants said that it was not unusual for land to
be registered in the name of a woman, particularly unmarried women or professional women who
have some educational background and financial means. Women’s ability to purchase land in Juba
was also reflected in a study by Tiernan Mennen (2012):

       In Juba, it is easier for women to own land. According to discussions with community members, leaders and
       government officials Bari chiefs have been relatively progressive with regards to women’s rights.
       Nevertheless, most land is obtained through market transactions, including through the chiefs for community
       land. If you have money, you can buy land, regardless of gender.

There are several reasons for why women may be having more success getting land registered in
their names in more cosmopolitan areas such as Juba. As discussed in more detail in relation to
LGI-3 below, there is a semi-formal registration process in Juba that operates parallel to the more
formal government registration process. Individuals from within the community may therefore have
more control over how the registration process operates and more confidence that the rights of their
female relatives will be protected. Furthermore, in circumstances in which communities divide land
that was collectively owned into individual parcels that are distributed upon request to members of
the community, the costs of allocating land through the semi-formal process may be less than
through other more formal registration processes. Males in the family may therefore be more
willing to allocate land to their female family members.

Outside of these examples, however, government officials in the Central Equatoria State (CES)
Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and representatives of INGOs active in the land sector report it is
rare to find women who have land registered in their name in most urban areas. According to
estimates from a legal adviser with the RSS Civil Service Commission, in big cities such as Juba,
Wau and Malakal, at most 10 to 20 percent of land is registered in the name of women (see LGI-2,
Dim. iv). In the smaller cities and towns, the numbers are undoubtedly far lower. Panel participants
also noted that officials in the registry are sometimes reluctant to register land in a woman’s name
for fear of reprisal from her male relatives. Disgruntled husbands, brothers or in-laws have been
known to threaten officials who register land in women’s name without the knowledge of their
families.

Most of the difficulties that women face in registering their land rights can be traced to customary
norms that prioritize property ownership for men and their male heirs. For married women, the
family land will almost always be registered in the name of their husbands. Parents also privilege
access to land for their sons over their daughters. According to local authorities in Northern Bari
Payam, for example, a parent who has sons and daughters will first sell land that would otherwise
go to the daughters before selling that which would go to the sons. South Sudan has not yet
developed a family law that would provide a statutory alternative to inheritance rules under
customary law, and in the absence of a written will expressing the decedent’s wishes, widows and
their children are at increased risk of being dispossessed of their land by their in-laws.

Despite the evidence that women’s property rights continue to be violated in contravention of
existing statutory and constitutional law, there is some evidence of evolving attitudes on the matter.
Women played key roles in the liberation struggle both on and off the battlefield, and prominent
women have risen to key leadership positions in government and civil society. Women leaders often
argue that the best way to recognize their contribution is by putting the issue of women’s rights in
the center of the agenda. There are also a large number of female-headed households as a result of
the war and society is being forced to reassess the manner in which it treats unmarried women. The
return of people from the diaspora is bringing an influx of new ideas, and people are slowly
beginning to appreciate the importance of educating and providing for their daughters. Divorce is
still largely discouraged, but women are increasingly successful at advocating for their right to
extricate themselves from bad relationships and to do so without losing their children and property.
These changes are particularly apparent among the youth.

 A panel participant narrated an incident in Terekeka County, in which a woman’s husband fell terminally ill. He
 wrote a will for his wife to sell a plot of land that they had registered in Juba to get money that would help her to
 cater for their kids. When the husband died, however, the woman decided not to sell the land. Her in-laws insisted
 that she must, but the woman refused, saying that she owned the land by virtue of the will and that it was her
 decision. After a protracted dispute, the woman acquiesced and agreed to sell the plot. When she was traveling back
 to Terekeka, however, her in-laws intercepted her and took the money.


Compensation Due to Land Use Changes in Urban Areas

The main form of land use change outside of the formal expropriation process occurs in the context
of urban rezoning efforts (see LGI-7 below). People who lose their land rights as a result of this
process are mainly those who reside in unregistered plots on public land, whether that land was
designated as public land during the war or whether it is unregistered land that was rezoned as
public land in the post-war period. These people’s land rights are not recognized in practice and the
Government may reclaim the land without paying compensation and without providing alternative
resettlement. For people who have been residing on public land for more than 30 years, the
expropriation of their land without compensation is contrary to the terms of the Land Act, which
states that anyone who has resided in an urban area for 30 years or more since the start of the war in
May 1983 shall be granted legal rights to that area. However, due to the high levels of displacement
caused by the war, the large numbers of people who have settled in a disorganized fashion in urban
areas and the urgent need to improve urban planning processes, this provision of the Land Act is not
being implemented and people residing on public land in urban areas are afforded little protection
against the loss of rights due to land use changes (LGI-2, Dim. vi).

Government and Community Formalization Processes

There are two main processes by which land is formalized in urban areas: a more formal
government process and a less formal community process. The government process starts with one
of two scenarios: either the state government identifies an existing informal settlement where they
would like to pursue survey, demarcation and registration activities, or else it negotiates with
communities living in peri-urban areas to gain access to a parcel of land for the government to
develop and distribute to interested applicants. Statistics on the area of land that has been registered
through the government processes are not currently available, but in Juba, the registered
landholdings are mostly found in the central part of town. Panel participants estimate that more than
50 percent of the landholdings in Juba have not been registered (see LGI-2, Dim. iii).

In registering individual landholdings in existing informal settlements, state authorities typically
establish a committee to travel to the area to consult with local residents. Sometimes the county
administration or the city council, rather than the state government, will take the lead in organizing
the registration activities. The committee begins by conducting a social assessment to find out who
resides in the area. After the assessment, the Survey Department in the Ministry of Physical
Infrastructure conducts a spatial survey to determine the number of plots and the plot sizes. For
people that are living on areas designated for a public purpose, such as roads, schools or health
clinics, the government asks them to voluntarily relocate elsewhere. If they do not move, the
government can forcibly evict them. As evidence of ownership, the Ministry of Physical
Infrastructure gives the landholder a written lease and other associated documents. The lease is then
registered in the land registry in the High Court. These documents provide prima facie evidence of
ownership, and non-documentary forms of evidence are rarely used to obtain recognition of claims
to property.

In addition to registering rights in existing urban settlements, government registration processes can
also be conducted in peri-urban areas, thereby converting land from customary land tenure to
individual urban leaseholds. To acquire community lands in these circumstances, the government
must first negotiate with the community concerned. If the community agrees to make the land
available, the government surveys the land and develops plans for roads and housing. They then
advertise the residential plots and invite people to apply. Demand usually far outstrips supply.
People whose applications are accepted are sent to the Survey Department and asked to pay a fee
that ranges from $32 USD to $188 USD, depending on the class of the plot. This amount covers:
the survey fee; a token that is issued by the community in the applicant’s name designating which
plot he or she is to receive; a service fee; a transport fee; and a stamp duty. The surveyors will also
often require other informal fees when they arrive in the field. Table 10 provides an overview of
the process for first-time formalization of residential land in Juba under the government process.

The community process follows a somewhat different approach. Community registration can be
conducted in urban areas where community leaders seek to formalize individual landholdings in
existing settlements or in peri-urban areas where land that is under customary land tenure is
converted into individual landholdings. The process for community registration in these
circumstances is similar to the government process, except that it is done without government
oversight, or with only the support of the lower levels of local government (i.e. the payam level).
Community leaders will often establish a committee to make decisions regarding pricing and who
will be eligible to apply for plots. The revenue accrues to community leaders or payam officials and
with little or no accountability for how the funds are to be used.

There are a number of differences between the government and community registration processes.
The community process is usually more expensive than the government process. Decisions about
who will be given land are more likely to exclude certain groups, such as people who come from
what are perceived to be rival ethnic groups. Tenure security tends to be weaker in community
process. Often the community will only provide residents with a document authorizing temporary
use of the land, whereas the government issues leases for terms of 25 years or more. The
community process also tends to be less transparent and more prone to corruption and self-
interested transactions.

Despite these shortcomings, the existence of the parallel community registration process shows that
there is a high demand for land registration in South Sudan. If properly managed, this demand could
lead to rapid tenure formalization and improved tenure security for populations in urban areas. The
challenge would be to do so without undermining the tenure security and livelihoods of peri-urban
communities and people residing in informal settlements within urban centers. In recent years, the
CES government has given tacit approval to community registration processes. According to panel
participants, the state government has learned from its past mistakes and is now trying to maintain
more of a presence whenever land is formalized. But inequities and a lack of oversight over the
process continue to present serious challenges and there is a need for more systematic monitoring of
registration processes that occur outside of government control.

Whether seeking to formalize landholdings through the government or community process, most
applicants are confronted with a number of obstacles. The registration procedures are not clear, nor
are they being properly communicated to applicants. People can be made to wait for years to get
their documents as the land is surveyed and demarcated. Complaints of discrimination based on
gender or ethnicity are commonplace. Information about fees is not made publicly available,
amounts can vary widely depending on who is doing the asking, and receipts are often not provided.
According to one interviewee, when he went to confirm that his name was in the registry he was
made to pay $75 USD for the information without a receipt. Practices such as these put the
formalization process outside the reach of most people. Certain practices on the demand side also
complicate the formalization process. When people hear that a certain area will be demarcated, they
often move to the area and erect informal settlements in the hopes that they will be recognized as
legitimate owners when the formalization process starts.

 In July 2012, an incident took place on the outskirts of Juba that demonstrated how violent and contentious the land
 formalization process could become. The situation started when a senior politician reportedly approached a
 community in place called Mia U Saba (107 in Arabic) in Northern Bari Payam and asked for a parcel of land to
 establish a farm. The politician reached an agreement with the community that he would be given the land in
 exchange for a number of benefits, including priority access to employment opportunities and academic
 scholarships for community members.

 After the agreement was made, settlements started surfacing around the farm. Various individuals and groups took
 advantage of the politician’s agreement to obtain land for themselves. They brought in surveyors and began
 demarcating plots and distributing tokens. Soon more people started seeing this area as a land market and they were
 distributing tokens freely.

 The chiefs and other community leaders reacted against the distribution scheme. Fighting broke out between a small
 group of people and quickly took on ethnic overtones. A number of people were killed and the Legislative
 Assembly called for investigations into the incident (Sudan Trib. 2012d).


Affordability of Registration Processes

Land prices through the formalization process are far lower than prices in the open market. In
instances where the government has acquired a parcel of land and is distributing it to people on a
first-come, first-serve basis, first class plots can sell for as little as $750 USD. Once the lease is
obtained from the government, it must be annually renewed, but it is freely transferable. Costs in
the open market, on the other hand, can reach as high as $20,000 to $22,500 USD or more for
completely undeveloped plots of land.

After an individual’s application for land through the government distribution scheme has been
accepted, he or she must pay a number of administrative fees to process the transaction. At the
Survey Department, applicants pay a fee that ranges from $43 USD (for third class plots) to $188
USD (for first class plots), which covers: the survey fee; a token that is issued by the community in
the applicant’s name designating which plot he or she is to receive; a service fee; a transport fee,
and a stamp duty. The amounts required in fees are not typically made available to applicants in the
form of an official schedule of fees, so applicants are forced to rely on whatever information is
provided by the authorities in the Survey Department.

Obtaining land through the community process can also be problematic. In several instances, forms
were distributed to people residing in the areas designated for formalization so that they could
register their claims. People who filed the forms were given tokens as evidence of their claim to a
particular plot of land. Fee amounts in the community process vary widely, but one interviewee said
that had to pay $663 USD for the token, followed by a $250 USD registration fee, a $250 USD
demarcation fee, a service fee and a payment to the payam authorities. The total cost was
approximately $1,250 USD. Revenue from these transactions accrued to community leaders, though
it may also be shared with local government authorities. Additional fines may also apply for people
who fail to pay for the tokens. If residents choose not to participate in the process, community
leaders can sell the tokens to other applicants. This sometimes leads to problems when the people
residing on the land are asked to vacate to make the area available to the newcomers.

The costs associated with registering land under either the government or community process
comprise a large percentage of the costs associated with accessing land in urban areas. Assuming a
property value of $750 USD for first-time registration of a first class plot, and administrative fees
(formal and informal payments) of $250 USD, then the costs of registration far exceed five percent
of the purchase price of the land (see LGI-3, Dim. iii). Additional informal fees may also be
required, including:

       Facilitation fees to expedite the process;

                                                         38

             Paying transport costs or providing a ‘foot fee’ for officials to visit the plot in question;
             Payment for forms and other documents;
             Payments to facilitate the survey activities, which are often negotiated on the ground with
              members of the survey department; and
             Costs for ‘tea’ and ‘lunch’ that officials require prior to carrying out their activities.

In order to have documents processed and the land surveyed and registered in a timely manner, the
informal costs can reach $250 USD and more (see LGI-3, Dim. iv). The high levels of poverty in
South Sudan, coupled with the convoluted and poorly publicized procedures, the costs of the
process place formalization outside the reach of many if not most people in the country. There can
be a lot of harassment in the process and women tend to be more victimized than men. The cost of
the process also has a disproportionate impact on displaced populations. There is little planning
being done for how to accommodate IDPs and returnees into the system. According to interviewees,
most IDPs and returnees in Juba have settled in an area called Gudele. The formal and informal
costs of registration in Juba can reach as high as $4,000 to $5,000 USD, which is outside the reach
of most South Sudanese.

                              Text Box 3: Irregularities in the Formalization Process
 One panel participant recounted an incident associated with a formalization process in a neighborhood of Juba called
 Hai Zendia. The state authorities required that he pay $25 USD every month to retain the right to his land. They said
 that when they were ready to demarcate the plots, he would be given a lease document as proof of ownership. The
 man paid every month from 2008 to 2013 and did not receive any receipts for the payment. He then left town for a
 weeklong trip outside the country and when he returned he found that his house had been demolished to make way
 for a road.

Land Use Restrictions

Land governance in South Sudan is comprised of parallel and overlapping systems of statutory and
customary land tenure. For the most part, statutory land use restrictions have limited reach in rural
areas, where traditional authorities are responsible for prescribing land use restrictions. In urban
areas, the state, municipal and county-level institutions are responsible for regulating land use. Due
to the underdeveloped legal framework, land use restrictions are typically only enforced when they
overlap with existing norms and practices. As the gaps in the legislative framework are filled with
new laws and the existing statutes are brought into accordance with one another, greater attention
must be devoted to ensuring that land use restrictions in the law are applied consistently in practice.
Table 12 provides an overview of land use restrictions in urban and rural areas:

   Type of Restriction                                           Description
Land transactions         Aside from the fact that foreigners cannot buy land in freehold and are usually
                          excluded from the process for formalizing landholdings, there are no formal
                          restrictions on land transactions in urban areas. In rural areas, land is understood to
                          belong to communities in perpetuity, which in theory should restrict third parties from
                          permanently alienating people from their land. In practice, however, land acquisitions
                          for public and private purposes often amounts to a permanent transfer of rights.
Land ownership            The 2009 Land Act lists freehold as one of the tenure types available in South Sudan,
                          but in practice, there is no land that is held in freehold anywhere in the country; nor are
                          there any serious discussions underway to make land available in freehold. Although
                          not a formal restriction per se, in practice, the Government is restricting the forms of
                          land ownership available in South Sudan.
Owner type                Leaseholds in urban areas are technically available to both South Sudanese and foreign
                          applicants, but due to the high demand for land and the scarce supply, most leases for
                          new residential areas are allocated to South Sudanese. Foreigners typically gain access
                          to land through subleases with the primary leaseholders.
                          Many customary systems do not permit women to own land, or restrict women’s ability
                          to own land independently of their husbands or male relatives. The risks of
                          landlessness are particularly acute for divorced women. Customary land tenure may
                          also restrict people from outside of the community from acquiring community land.
                          Internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees are commonly permitted to settle
                          temporarily on community lands if they have a good reason for leaving their
                          homelands, but there is usually an explicit condition that once the cause of their
                          displacement subsides, they will return to their home areas.
                          South Sudanese law restricts foreigners from owning land in freehold, although they
                          may obtain leases for up to 99 years.
Use                       In Juba, land use plans have been developed for Old Juba, which is a small area at the
                          city center. However, the city has expanded far beyond this area and the land use
                          planning has not kept up. Land use designations are not enforced in any concerted or
                          meaningful manner, though certain areas are known to be designated for markets,
                          schools, residences and other purposes.
                          In rural areas, restrictions on land use are applied according to principles of customary
                          land tenure. For example, chiefs, landlords or other traditional authorities may
                          designate which land can be used for agricultural purposes, which land is allocated as a
                          buffer zone through which people and their livestock may pass, and which land has
                          ritual or spiritual significance. These restrictions under customary law are largely
                          adhered to in most circumstances.
Size of holding           Land in urban areas is categorized according to the colonial system in which there are
                          three classes of plots. First class plots are typically about 900 square meters, second
                          class are about 625 square meters, and third class plots are about 400 square meters.
                          The size restrictions are not followed strictly, and plot sizes may vary from
                          neighborhood to neighborhood and in different locations in the country. In Western
                          Equatoria State, for example, third class plots are often 900 square meters. Surveyors
                          have also been accused of introducing changes to the plans when they are surveying
                          plots on the ground to make additional plots available to distribute for their personal
                          use. This causes discrepancies to surface between what is contained in the official map
                          and what exists on the ground.
                          The Land Act includes several provisions limiting the size of landholdings that can be
                          acquired for various purposes. According to Section 15(5): “Any allocation of a piece
                          of land beyond 250 feddans (105 ha) for commercial, agricultural, forestry, ranch,
                          poultry or farming purposes shall be approved by the Concerned Ministry in the State
                          after transmission by the County Land Authority or the Payam Land Council.”
                          Traditional authorities may transfer landholdings smaller than 105 hectares with the
                          consensus of the community. Land transfers are also subject to a ceiling “that shall be
                          prescribed by regulations.” However, the government has not yet enacted regulations
                          for the Land Act and in practice, there are few if any limits on the size of landholdings.

                                As a result, exceedingly large land investments have been documented of hundreds of

 Price                          There are few controls on property prices in South Sudan. In Juba, individuals can
                                charge up to $20,000 per month or more with 6 months rent paid up front for
                                residential housing. Typically, these arrangements are made through subleases with the
                                primary leaseholder, which allows the sub-lessee usage rights to the land and housing.
                                Leasing land itself without any structures can be done more cheaply through the
                                government system, but as discussed above, there are also community-driven processes
                                that are not subject to government price control.

                                                          interested institutions as a matter of policy or practice.


Horizontal and Vertical Administrative Overlap

In theory, institutions at the national level are meant to be primarily responsible for policy-making
and the state governments are to be the main implementers. In practice, however, there is little
coordination between the various levels of government (i.e. vertical overlap) and among institutions
within each level of government (i.e. horizontal overlap).

The 2005 Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan and its successor, the 2011 Transitional
Constitution both recognized land administration to be a concurrent power shared between the
national and state governments. As these powers are interpreted, however, state governments retain
the bulk of decision-making authority for land issues. As a result the national government often
finds it difficult to access state and community land even for public purposes, such as the
construction of roads and office space for national institutions. Accessing land for private
investment is similarly contentious. A number of instances have been documented in which the
national government pursues a national development project (e.g. commercial farm, timber
plantation, etc.) on what is ostensibly land owned by the national government only to have state
governments and communities assert their contradictory claims to the land (e.g. forestry projects in
Western Equatoria and Central Equatoria). The ensuing disputes have undermined efforts to
promote rural development and stimulate local economies.

The poor coordination among the levels of government is evident in a number of areas. Typically,
state ministry personnel report to their minister only and not to the national ministry. State ministers
report to their respective state governor who reports to the president. These reporting lines make it
difficult for the national government and state government to coordinate activities. Other
contradictory practices contribute to the problem. According to the RSS Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development, for example, state-level authorities supervise the
activities state forestry personnel but salaries are paid directly by the national Ministry. This creates
confusion among civil servants as to who are their appropriate supervisors. The lack of human and
financial resources, corruption and misgovernance also contribute to the problem.

                              Text Box 4: Horizontal Overlap in Mangala
 One example of poor coordination among executive institutions can be seen in a proposed investment in a sugar
 farm and processing facility in CES. The RSS Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reportedly allocated a parcel of
 public land along the Nile River to a Ugandan firm without consulting the communities residing in the area or other
 Ministries. As it happens, the area was an important transit route for wildlife crossing the river from Bandingilo
 National Park. This caused a dispute between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Wildlife. The county
 administrations of Juba and Terekeka were simultaneously involved in a dispute over where the border would lie
 between the two counties, with both claiming ownership over the area. The wrangling among government
 institutions has considerably delayed the beginning of the project.


County Land Authorities (CLAs) and Payam Land Councils (PLCs)

The 2009 Land Act calls for two new land governance institutions to be created at the local
government level: the County Land Authority (CLA) and the Payam Land Council (PLC). Among
the main functions of these institutions are to coordinate activities and mediate relationships
between the three levels government and the communities residing within their areas. Other
functions include the following:

      Hold and allocate lands vested in the local government;
      Make recommendations to state Ministries on planning for gazetted lands;
      Facilitate the registration and transfer of interests in land;
      Support and assist cadastral operations and survey activities;
      Advise the local community on issues related to land tenure, usage, and exercise over land
       rights;
      Protect customary land rights and communal grazing land, forest, wetlands and water
       resources; and
      Oversee consultation processes between community and State Government.

Almost five years after the Land Act was passed, the CLAs and PLCs have not yet been established.
Several pilot efforts are underway to establish CLAs in Bor and Yambio, and other CLAs have been
established in Central Equatoria, but the institutions are not yet fully operational and most states do
not have plans to create the new institutions.

Aside from the technical difficulty of creating these institutions where none existed before, political
challenges are beginning to surface as well. For example, according to a panel participant, when a
CLA was established in Terekeka County, a group of people in the area felt as though the CLA
narrowly represented only one group of interests in the county and state government. This group
responded by establishing their own CLA. The competition between the two institutions caused a
considerable degree of confusion in the area and the latter CLA has since disbanded. In other
locations, CLAs have complained that institutions created under the Local Government Act have
preempted their decisions. Indeed, the discrepancies between the Land Act and the Local
Government Act have been cited as a source of concern in the 2013 Land Policy, which calls for a
                                                         42

review of legislation in the land sector to bring the various laws into conformity with one another
and with the Transitional Constitution.

Concerns have also been voiced about the composition of the CLAs. According to the Land Act, the
CLAs are to be comprised of six members: The County Commissioner serves as chairperson, and a
number of other representatives appointed by the state and local government, traditional authorities,
civil society, and women’s groups. In practice, however, the state and local government plays a
dominant role in determining who is represented in the CLAs.

The problems that South Sudan has faced in establishing CLAs and PLCs are indicative of a lack of
attention to land governance issues at the national level. In the absence of clear directives from the
national government, state and local governments have sought to address land issues in a piecemeal
fashion without sufficient coordination among institutions. The divorcing of institutions from
national development plans renders institutions more susceptible to political squabbling at the local
level and hinders efforts to establish new institutions in a more concerted fashion across the
country.

Transparency Concerns in Developing Policy Drafts

In developing land-related policies, there is often considerable emphasis placed on obtaining public
input into the policy documents. In preparing the Land Policy, for example, workshops were held in
each of the ten states and a team of South Sudanese specialists in land issues was invited to
comment on the draft. When the 2007 Forest Policy was presented to the Southern Sudan
Legislative Assembly, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was asked to conduct additional
consultations with state governments. The United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) and FAO then assisted the Ministry to conduct workshops with state and county
authorities. The Environmental Policy involved consultations with state authorities and a
stakeholder’s conference. The Ministry also conducted study tours to different countries in Africa to
see how they developed their environmental policies.
                                                      43

While these policies have demonstrated a degree of transparency in the development phase, once
the policy text is prepared, there is no guarantee that members of the public will be able to access it.
Often government institutions and their international partners will restrict access to policy
documents as they try to lobby for their endorsement by the Council of Ministers or the Legislative
Assembly. Officials routinely refuse to share draft texts until the relevant authorities have officially
endorsed the policy. As a result, it can be difficult for interest groups to lobby for policy changes
before the policy is formally adopted and people who have participated in the consultative process
cannot easily determine whether their views were incorporated into the policy drafts.

Representation of Marginalized Groups in Policy Documents

Land policies in South Sudan include provisions addressing a number of marginalized groups,
including women, IDPs and returnees (see Table 15). There is scant reference, however, to other
groups who are often targeted in land policies in other contexts, such as indigenous peoples and
landless populations. Indeed, the term ‘indigenous peoples’ is rarely encountered in discussions
about land in South Sudan and there is no consensus on how the term applies in the South Sudanese
context.

For those marginalized groups that are mentioned, implementation of government policy remains a
serious problem. Aside from the fact that most land-related policies have not yet been formally
adopted and as such, it is too early to evaluate their implementation, some fundamental
shortcomings are already evident in the policy drafts. The policies are not costed, they do not
include timelines for implementation, and there is little agreement on the indicators that will be used
to monitor changes over time.

                   Table 15: Representation of Marginalized Groups in Policy
     Group                              Extent to Which Group is Represented in Law or Policy
 Women               Women’s land rights feature prominently in public consultations and workshops on land rights
                     and to a significant extent women’s rights have been streamlined into existing policy.
                     However, the issue warrants greater attention and a more detailed analysis of the problem than
                     what is included in existing policies. The Land Policy, for example, makes a number of
                     general assertions about the difficulties that women face in accessing land without providing
                     empirical evidence or more nuanced discussions about the specific difficulties that women
                     face in accessing land through market transactions, government distribution schemes,
                     inheritance, gifts, etc.
 IDPs, Returnees     The rights of displaced persons and returnees are a central issue in South Sudan. Throughout
 and Refugees        the decades long humanitarian intervention in South Sudan a number of actors have addressed
                     this issue in great detail. Humanitarian aid continues to receive a disproportionate amount of
                     attention as compared to more development-oriented programming. As a result, the rights of
                     these populations often feature prominently in government policy.
 Indigenous          Indigenous peoples are not explicitly mentioned in any of the existing policies. Nor is South
 Peoples             Sudan a signatory to the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. There is a
                     reference to ‘indigenous knowledge’ in the Environmental Policy, but the term is not used to
                     denote the heightened land rights that indigenous peoples are afforded under international law.
                     There is little understanding among South Sudanese about the technical aspects of indigenous
                     people’s land rights or about how the term ‘indigenous peoples’ would apply in the South
                     Sudanese context.
 Migrants            Urban centers in South Sudan are experiencing a large influx of economic migrants from
                     elsewhere in South Sudan and from neighboring countries. The rights of these populations are
                     rarely considered in government policies. To a certain extent, the interests of migrants may be
                     overshadowed by the large numbers of IDPs, returnees and refugees in South Sudan.
 Landless            The issue of landlessness is rarely considered in government policy. There is a general sense
                     that with the low population density in South Sudan, there is enough land for everyone.
                     However, certain populations are at increased risk of landlessness, such as divorced women,
                     widows and orphans. Large government campaigns of evicting people from public spaces
                     have contributed to the problem in recent years.

The Land Use Planning, Land Management and Taxation theme assesses the enforceability of these
processes and the extent to which they rely on a broad consensus. It covers five indicators that are
assessed using 17 dimensions. The first three indicators (LGI-7 to LGI-9) focus on the justification
of regulations for land use planning and management on the basis of public interest. The last two
indicators (LGI-10 and LGI-11) examine the transparency and cost-effectiveness of land-related tax
systems.

Land Use Planning in Urban and Rural Areas

Land use planning processes in rural areas are still in their very early stages of development. The
RSS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development is conducting several
pilot projects in partnership with a number of international organizations that involve land use
planning and mapping components, but the Ministry has not yet progressed to the point of
implementing national land use plans. Table 17 lists several current and past projects relevant to
land use planning.

                                            enable the government to develop and implement official land use
                                            plans.

State and local governments conduct some land use planning activities in urban areas, but their
effectiveness is hampered by top-down, non-participatory approaches and a lack of transparency.
For example, several different town plans have been created for Juba since 2005. JICA is also
working with the Upper Nile State Ministry of Physical Infrastructure to develop a town plan for
Malakal (Atekit 2013). These town plans are not available for public review and were not
developed with significant input from the public. The town plans have been the subject of
occasional reports in local media, but no one outside of a few key personnel in the state-level
Ministries of Physical Infrastructure are given access to the plans. Changeovers in administration in
the Ministries can make existing town plans obsolete, as new Ministers will sometimes develop
their own land use plans rather than working within the bounds of their predecessor’s plans.
Although state and local governments are in charge of most town planning activities, there is also a
degree of competition between the national government and state governments over control of the
urban planning process.

An example of top-down approaches to land use planning that are lacking in public participation
can be seen in the Government’s decision to relocate the capital city from Juba to a place called
Ramciel, an undeveloped area located at the intersection of the Greater Equatoria, Greater Bahr-el-
Ghazal and Greater Upper Nile regions. The idea of relocating the capital had been discussed even
before the signing of the CPA in 2005 as a way of bringing the three regions of the country together
through a shared capital city. It gained traction during the interim period following the end of the
war when land disputes ballooned in Juba and began to frustrate plans to attract investment and
develop the city. In August 2011, the President signed an executive order declaring the
Government’s intent to relocate the capital city from Juba to Ramciel (Sudan Trib. 2012b). The
decision was made without parliamentary approval or consultations with the communities living in
the area.

There has been a lot of speculation on all sides about whether the planned relocation is feasible,
given the many constraints with which the Government is operating. Nonetheless, the
Government’s actions in recent years suggest that they are committed to the decision. In 2011, the
Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning hired a company called the South Korean Land and
Housing Corporation to carry out an aerial survey of the proposed area (Sudan Trib. 2012a; Sudan
Trib. 2012c). By October 2012, the company was meant to complete the ground survey, including
mapping, feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessment, city structure framework
and demarcation of zones. If these activities have been concluded, their findings have not been
shared with the public.

As a consequence of the underdeveloped land use planning systems, government decisions
regarding changes of land use take a long time to be implemented. Panel participants estimated that
most changes in land use take more than three years to implement (see LGI-7, Dim. iv).
Mechanisms that allow the public to capture benefits from changing land use, such as betterment
taxes, levies for infrastructure or property tax, are nonexistent (see LGI-7, Dim. iii).

Land Use Planning and Urban Growth

As is evident from the preceding discussion, urban land use planning systems in South Sudan are in
very early stages of development. Land use planning activities have only been conducted in a small
number of urban areas and most new settlements are being constructed without any formal land use
planning process (see LGI-8, Dim. i and ii). An example of the state of land use planning that has
been done in South Sudan can be seen in a proposed plan from the national government to develop
capital cities in each of the ten states in the shape of animals and fruits. The plan was quietly
abandoned while still in its early stages, after being criticized in the press (VOA News 2010).

When coupled with the rapid population growth and expansion that urban centers in South Sudan
have experienced since the end of the civil war in 2005, the lack of formal planning processes
results in large informal settlements with little infrastructure, whether in the form of roads, water or
electricity. The poorly planned urban growth is particularly evident in Juba. Returnees, internally
displaced persons (IDPs), economic migrants, security sector personnel, expats working in the
international aid industry, and people coming to work for the new government have flocked to the
city in recent years. Precise population statistics are not available, but it has been estimated that

when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2005, Juba was home to about
250,000 people, including 163,000 residents and 87,000 IDPs (Martin and Mosel 2011). A 2009
land use survey by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimated Juba’s
population at 406,000, with a 12.5 percent growth rate (Id.). Other estimates place the population at
500,000 to 600,000 for 2010. Table 19 provides figures on population growth in Juba from 1956 to
2010.

The rapid population growth in the postwar period has overwhelmed land administration systems in
Juba and elsewhere in South Sudan (see LGI-8, Dim. iii). Housing supplies in urban areas were not
sufficient to meet demand, and many residents had no option but to construct their homes on
unregistered landholdings. Urban expansion has put additional pressure on peri-urban lands, but the
process of converting those areas from customary land tenure to individualized landholdings has
been slow and plagued by disputes. As discussed above in Section 3.1, the increased demand has
created parallel formalization processes, in which local residents have taken it upon themselves to
organize the survey, demarcation and registration of urban plots outside of the formal government
process.

Building Permits

Much of the residential housing in urban areas of South Sudan is built without government
oversight and without first obtaining a building permit. Individuals who occupy a plot of land will
often develop their owns building plans independently and proceed directly to construction. Tukuls
(mud hut dwellings), which do not require building permits, also comprise a sizeable portion of the
housing in urban areas.

Nonetheless, there is a process for obtaining building permits in some areas (see Table 21). In Juba,
the CES Ministry of Physical Infrastructure manages the process, though in some cases the payam
authorities or the Juba City Council may also play a role. The process is not well advertised and

                                                            48

most people are not aware that they should first obtain a permit before constructing a residential
dwelling. There is no set cost for the permit. Rather, the cost varies according to the type of
building and the area where the project is proposed. After the permit is issued, there is little or no
inspection of the construction process to ensure that it adheres to the applicable regulations. As a
result, there is little incentive for residents to obtain a building permit prior to constructing housing,
as not having a building permit carries limited.

Time does not seem to be a major concern (see LGI-9, Dim. ii). Most permits are processed within
a week or so. This probably reflects a lack of demand as much as anything else. Juba still has a
relatively small population compared to other large cities in East Africa and the demand for
residential housing, while large when compared to supply, is still small enough that it does not
impose a huge administrative burden on institutions. Also, the fact that most people construct
houses without first obtaining a permit also translates into less work for the Ministry.

                         Table 21: Procedures for Obtaining a Building Permit
                                        Steps                                           Responsible Institution
 1. Develop building plans in consultation with accredited engineer and submit       State-level Ministry of
 plans to Town Planning Unit for review.                                             Physical Infrastructure
 2. After approval, the application is sent to a separate unit in the Town           State-level Ministry of Physical
 Planning Department to check that the name on the application matches with          Infrastructure
 the name associated with the plot in the land registry.
 3. From there, the applicant is sent to the state-level Revenue Authority to pay    State-level Revenue Authority
 a processing fee.
 4. The applicant brings the receipt back to the Town Planning Department for        State-level Ministry of Physical
 approval. Once approved, the applicant receives a certificate that serves as a      Infrastructure
 permit.


Although enforcement of building codes is limited, instances have been reported in which people
who build structures without a permit faced harsh sanctions from various government institutions.
In one example, a company built an office space in Juba without first obtaining a building permit. A
representative of the state government showed up on the building site one day accompanied by a
contingent of police officers and military personnel. The site supervisor was told to pay a $5,000
USD fine or else he and all the workers would be taken to jail. In another example, there was a large
construction project in central Juba opposite the police station that the state government threatened
to demolish because it was constructed without first obtaining building permits. While these
incidents relate primarily to buildings constructed for commercial purposes and not residential
dwellings, they nonetheless point to a need to candidly assess what approach to take towards
building without permits in a context where the process is so poorly understood and the
government’s capacity to monitor and inspect construction activities is so limited.

Land Valuation for Tax Purposes

There is no system for land or property tax based on market values in South Sudan. The most
significant taxes at the state and local level are business-related taxes, taxes on interstate and
international trade, and household taxes. Household taxes are probably revenue source most closely
related to a property tax. However, household tax rates are calculated according to the size, class
and location of the plot in question and do not take into consideration the property value as would a
land or property tax. Rates typically range from $6 USD to $18 USD per square meter, with larger
plots and those located closer to urban centers typically taxed more heavily. Such taxes are
generally considered to be regressive and limited in their ability to mobilize revenues at the local
level.

As noted in the 2013 Land Policy, the absence of a functioning property tax system undermines
good governance in the land sector:

            A clear fiscal framework for land management has the potential to raise much needed revenue for use in land
            acquisition and infrastructure development. Land taxation also discourages land speculation and provides
            incentives for efficient and appropriate land utilization.

The 2013 Land Policy calls for the adoption of a Land Valuation Act to help determine how
property might be valued for tax purposes and the RSS Ministry of Finance is reportedly
considering the development of a Local Government Property Tax Act, but neither legislation has
yet been developed. The only institutions that currently conduct land valuation can be found in the
Judiciary. Land values in this context are used to determine court fees, which are calculated as a
percentage of property value (see Section 3.5 below). They are not used for tax purposes.

Legal Basis for Tax Collection

The legal framework for tax collection is found mainly in the Transitional Constitution (2011), the
Taxation Act (2009) and the Local Government Act (2009). The Taxation Act sets out a basic
administrative machinery in the RSS Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to implement the
new tax system. The Act includes a number of provisions relating to business and income taxes, but
it does not mention property taxes.

The constitutional and statutory basis for property taxes can be found in the Transitional
Constitution and the Local Government Act. The Transitional Constitution recognizes the levying
of taxes as a concurrent power that is exercised by the central, state and local governments. Section
179 allows states to legislate for revenue generation from a number of sources, including “land and
property taxes and royalties,” and Section 166 recognizes the power of local governments “to levy,
charge, collect and appropriate fees and taxes in accordance with the law.” The Local Government
Act also provides a list of local tax sources, which includes a property tax and a land tax. Despite
these constitutionally- and statutorily-recognized powers, as noted above, the government has not
yet started collecting property taxes.

Problems in Tax Collection

There is a general lack of clarity about which institutions at which levels of government are
responsible for collecting taxes from different sources. Individuals and businesses are often made to
pay taxes to a number of different governmental actors who often do not recognize each other’s
authority. A study by David Solomon and Michael Bell (2011) for the USAID-funded Building
Responsibility for the Delivery of Government Services (BRIDGE) Program, for example,
encountered frequent references to “volunteer tax collectors,” who did not have any clear authority
to collect taxes. In other circumstances, when salaries of local officials went unpaid, they would
sometimes “withhold” revenue collections as informal “staff loans”.

Problems associated with multiple taxation are most pronounced in Juba, since the three levels of
government are all situated in the city. An example can be seen in the manner in which hotels are
taxed in Juba. In order to generate revenue from the profitable hotel industry, the central
government imposes a business profit tax on the hotels and the personal income tax of 10 percent
on all hotel employees. States also levy their own hotel tax. Public officials at both the state and
central government have admitted that overlapping taxes gives rise to a confusing “labyrinth of
taxes” in which there are “too many hands in people’s pockets.” The BRIDGE assessment also
found that the logistical and administrative capacity of tax collectors was severely lacking.
Communication with collectors in the field was very poor, financial reports of revenue collected
were generally not available, and revenue personnel were poorly trained in the specifics of their
jobs.

The manner in which exemptions are applied introduces additional confusion into the system.
According to Solomon and Bell (2011), there are a large number of de facto exemptions, none of
which are formalized in written law. In some instances, states have waived the entire household tax
in bad years. In others, household taxes are demanded without regard to the hardships they impose
on local populations. In April 2013, for example, Sudan Tribune reported that more than 150 people
were imprisoned in Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal State for failing to pay household taxes (Sudan Trib.
2013b). According to a local resident interviewed at the time, “Some people are being arrested not
because they did not want to pay but because they do not have anything to pay. They are poor to the
true meaning of being poor. They have nothing to give. Their survival is through kinship. Others
depend on assistance from the relatives.”

In addition to the legal and administrative difficulties, certain social attitudes also complicate efforts
to generate revenue from taxes. During the civil war, individuals and communities would often be

                                                   51

subject to taxes by various armed groups, which had little accountability for the manner in which
the revenue would be used. These experiences undermined people’s confidence in the system and
make them less likely to view the payment of taxes as an obligation that citizens have towards their
country. South Sudanese also continue to receive considerable amounts of free service delivery in
the form of humanitarian aid, which may obscure people’s understandings of the link between taxes
and public service delivery.

                  Text Box 5: Reduced Incentives to Collect Taxes at the State Level
 State governments in South Sudan receive revenues from two primary sources: (1) transfers from the central
 government (RSS); and (2) own-source revenues, which include both tax and non-tax revenue. National revenue is
 almost entirely derived from oil production. When the Government of South Sudan halted oil production in January
 2012, transfers to the state governments reduced dramatically. But the loss in revenue was offset by an increase in
 revenue from taxes and customs duties. According to the RSS Deputy Finance Minister, as of April 2013, the
 government was collecting approximately $19 million USD a month in taxes and customs duties, compared with
 $3.5 million USD before the country halted oil production (The Age 2013).

 An assessment by the BRIDGE program showed how dependent states are on oil revenue and transfers from the
 central government. The assessment was carried out in five states: Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, Northern Bahr-el-
 Ghazal, Warrap and Unity. Transfers from the Government of South Sudan accounted for more than 93 percent of
 total state revenues in the first four states. In Unity State, transfers account for just 39.5 percent of total revenues,
 due to the substantial revenue that Unity state receives from oil production. State dependency on oil revenues
 discourages the development of a robust system of own-source revenues, including property taxes.

3.3 Management of Public Land
The Management of Public Land theme assesses the transparency and accountability of public land
management, including the processes by which government institutions acquire and release land. It
contains four indicators that are assessed using 16 dimensions. The first indicator (LGI-12)
examines the extent to which government landownership is justified by the delivery of public
goods. The next two indicators (LGI-13 and LGI-14) focus on compulsory acquisition procedures to
see whether they are justified, exercised only for clear public purposes and managed appropriately.
The last indicator (LGI-15) assesses the transfer of rights over government-owned land.

Defining Public Land and Community Land

There is some uncertainty regarding the definitions of community land and public land in South
Sudanese law. The Land Act defines community land to include all land “held, managed or used”
by a given community. Public land, on the other hand, includes land for which “no private
ownership including customary ownership may be established by any legal process.” To the extent
that there is no terra nullius in South Sudan and the Land Act formally recognizes all land
administered under customary land tenure, then communities should own nearly all the rural land in
the country. It this reading of the law is correct, then public landholdings in rural areas should be
limited to a few forest reserves, game reserves, national parks and agro-industrial schemes, and it is
not clear to what the catch-all provision in the above definition of public land refers.

Whatever the intent of the drafters of the Land Act, it is clear that many policy-makers do not
interpret the law in this manner. Several panel participants, for example, were of the understanding
that community lands only extended for a certain distance outside of villages (e.g. to a 20 kilometer
radius around a given village). This viewpoint is in accordance with (northern) Sudanese law, which
recognizes community rights within a set perimeter but not more extensive customary rights to
forests, grazing areas and buffer zones. Public officials also commonly interpret the provision of the
Land Act that states, “All land in Southern Sudan is owned by the people of Southern Sudan and its
usage shall be regulated by the Government,” to mean that land belongs to the Government and that
the Government has ultimate decision-making authority over community lands, thus conflating the
distinction between public and community land. The ambiguity in the law further obscures the
official government position on land ownership in rural areas.

Institutional Considerations

As noted in relation to LGI-5, there are major ambiguities in the manner in which responsibility for
public land is assigned among government institutions and between the government and
communities (LGI-12, Dim. iii). Post-war legal reforms have sought to strengthen the extent to
which communities control and benefit from their land and natural resources. The government
policy that ‘land belongs to the community’ has raised expectations among people residing in rural
areas that they will be involved in development efforts, even those situated on public land. Their
expectations are supported by the fact that the war prevented the Sudanese Government from
effectively establishing control over many public landholdings in rural areas. In many cases,
communities have resided for generations on what is ostensibly public land. From the viewpoint of
these communities, the land is theirs, even if the government technically expropriated it through a
statutory decree or gazettement process during the civil war.

Nonetheless, the degree to which responsibility is unambiguously assigned appears to vary
somewhat by sector. For example, according to the RSS Ministry of Roads and Bridges,
management responsibility for roads is clearly assigned between the national, state and local
governments. International and interstate roads are the responsibility of the national government,
roads within the state are the responsibility of the state government, and roads within towns are the
responsibility of the local government. Ministry representatives maintain that there is a publicly
                                                 53

available master plan for the nation, which is given to state and local governments such that they
can structure their plans accordingly, though they were not able to provide researchers with a copy.

Government-owned forest concessions provide a contrasting example. Since its establishment in
2005, the Government of Southern Sudan has sought to generate revenue from its teak plantations
through public-private partnerships with various foreign investors and development funds. The two
most prominent examples involve forest reserves in Western and Central Equatoria and investments
made by British and Finnish Development funds (Deng 2011a). Shortly after the agreements were
signed in 2007, disputes arose between the various levels of government and between the
government and communities residing in and around the plantations, reflecting a more general
ambiguity with the legal framework regarding management responsibility over public lands.

Land Inventory and Maps

There is no comprehensive inventory of public lands in South Sudan (LGI-12, Dim. v). Records of
public landholdings are spread across many different institutions and are often inaccurate or out-of-
date; in many cases, the records simply do not exist. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,
Cooperatives and Rural Development has mapped a number of teak plantations in Central, Western
and Eastern Equatoria States. Concessions covering approximately 30,250 hectares of teak forests
in these two states have been allocated to foreign companies since 2007. Aside from these teak
reserves, however, most maps for the public forests in South Sudan are either out-of-date or
nonexistent. Several interviewees for this study believed the maps to be contained in a government
gazette; none, however, were able to produce a copy of the gazette.

Government officials maintain that maps exist for many of national parks and game reserves.
However, they are often inaccurate and boundaries have not been demarcated on the ground.
According to the RSS Ministry of Wildlife, Conservation and Tourism, the maps were mostly
developed during the colonial era and reserve areas created since then are less well mapped.
Boundaries are typically indicated with reference to natural landmarks, such as roads, rivers and
mountains, but most have not been formally surveyed and demarcated according to the boundaries
that exist on the maps. A few posts demarcating boundaries were placed during the colonial or post-
colonial period, but they were few and far between. In some cases, they have been destroyed or
washed away by the elements (Johnson 2010). The social upheaval and large-scale displacement
during Sudan’s successive civil wars have further complicated the issue, as many populations
sought refuge in reserve areas during the war and have been residing there for decades. Many of the
maps that do exist are also stored in poor conditions and highly susceptible to damage from the
elements.

Circumstances of Expropriation

Expropriations occur in both rural and urban settings in South Sudan. In urban areas, most
expropriations occur when state and local governments acquire community land in peri-urban areas
to convert into individual residential leaseholds. Within town limits, some unregistered
landholdings may also be expropriated if people have constructed on land designated for a public
use, such as roads, hospitals or schools. In rural areas, land may be expropriated to establish
settlements for returnee or displaced populations or to make land available for development projects
or investments. Land that is acquired for private interests, such as the expansion of urban residential
areas or for large-scale land-based investments in rural areas, account for the majority of
expropriated land (see LGI-13, Dim. i). It typically takes an extended period of time for land to be
transferred to its intended use (see LGI-13, Dim. ii).

Rezoning and Expropriation in Urban Areas

Shortly after the end of the war in 2005, state and local governments in southern Sudan began an
extensive urban rezoning process. As a consequence of the large-scale displacement during the war
and the influx of people after the signing of the CPA, towns and cities across South Sudan had been
growing in a haphazard and disorganized manner. Most landholdings in urban areas were comprised
of informal settlements whose poor planning undermined efforts to develop formal land governance
systems and presented a number of risks to health and security. Police and firefighters could not
easily penetrate the labyrinth of streets in many areas and sanitation services were virtually non-
existent. The rezoning process was meant to address these issues and pave the way for more
organized urban development initiatives.

At the start of the process, the Governor of CES issued an executive order in January 2009,
authorizing demolitions in a list of twenty-nine areas in Juba. The demolitions targeted informal
settlements on roads and other public spaces and were supervised by a demolition committee that
included the CES Governor, Juba County Commissioner, and a number of security advisors.
According to the Southern Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (SSRRC), 27,896 people
were displaced by the demolitions between January and March 2009. At that point, the authorities
stopped keeping track of the numbers, but the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) estimated
that an additional 30,000 to 40,000 people were affected from March to June 2009 (Deng 2010).
UNMIS voiced concern about the process in a report from 2009 (Wheeler):

       UNMIS is concerned that implementation of the Government of Central Equatoria’s plan to improve living
       conditions in Juba has not been done in a manner which is consistent with southern Sudanese law and
       international human rights standards.

The manner in which the demolitions were conducted generated a considerable amount of
resentment among local populations. Evictions were carried out with little or no notice and involved
heavy security contingents, sometimes as large as 500 men, comprised of soldiers from the SPLA,
Joint Integrated Units (JIU), military police, Southern Sudan Police Service (SSPS), wildlife
rangers, fire brigades, prison guards, and National Security Service (NSS). According to panel
participants, the government’s approach to urban rezoning has improved in recent years, but there
are still lingering concerns about a lack of adequate notice and compensation.

Since 2009, urban rezoning activities have spread to other state capitals and several county
headquarters. In February 2012, for example, the county administration in Rumbek (capital of
Lakes State) demolished a number of shops and houses to make space for roads. According to
Radio Miraya (2012), the Rumbek County Commissioner said there would be no compensation for
the owners because the area they occupied was not meant for construction of houses or shops.
Demolition activity has also spread to rural areas. Five hundred homes were reportedly demolished
                                                    55
                                                                                                            DRAFT
in Kuerlonga Village in Unity State in April 2013. Demolitions have also been carried out in Akobo
and Chukudum (towns in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria States, respectively) in order to build roads
and implement new town plans. Aside from a few isolated media reports, recent rezoning activities
have remained mostly undocumented and neither government actors nor international agencies are
actively monitoring the numbers of people affected.

                          Text Box 6: Social Unrest Associated with Demolitions
 In some cases, displaced groups have reacted violently to demolition activities. Researchers from the Overseas
 Development Institute (ODI) (Martin and Mosel 2011) documented an incident in an area called Hai Miskin
 (meaning ‘poor neighborhood’ in Arabic) in Juba. Residents of the area said that they were informed overnight that
 the land they were staying on had been sold and that they would have to vacate their homes. When they refused they
 were reportedly assaulted by the police and threatened with further violence if they did not quit the area
 immediately. In a more recent incident, after a demolition process was carried out on the outskirts of Juba in May
 2013, a mob formed and attacked two officials from the Archdiocese of Juba (Comboni Missionaries 2013).

            expropriation                                    lodged during the last 3 years.

Fairness and Promptness of Compensation

Precise data about compensation for expropriations is not available, but panel participants
maintained that compensation was provided, at least certain circumstances. According to
representatives of the Juba City Council, for example, compensation is almost always provided to
individuals evicted from registered plots in Juba. Compensation typically takes the form of
alternative land in another area. However, officials admit that there are issues about the suitability
of the land given in compensation, in that there is no guarantee that the alternative land is equally
valuable or has access to the same services as the land that was expropriated (see LGI-14, Dim. i).
People who have constructed informal settlements on public lands are not compensated, although if
they have constructed on land designated for residential use they may be given an opportunity to
formalize their landholding through the registration processes discussed in relation to LGI-3.

For the expropriation of community land in rural areas, communities are often compensated by
providing them with a number of plots in the newly demarcated areas or with direct compensation
                                                        56
                                                                                            DRAFT
in the form of cash or building materials. According to the Ministry of Roads and Bridges,
communities often provide land for road construction without requiring the government to pay
compensation, particularly when there are no structures on the land. In other cases, the community
may ask for schools or health clinics to be built in return for the land. The Ministry also acquires
land from communities in order to extract the necessary materials for road construction, such as
sand and gravel. In these cases, road contractors pay royalties for the construction materials to the
communities, the cost of which is passed on to the government.

Groups with secondary rights are rarely compensated in expropriations in either urban or rural areas
(LGI-14, Dim. ii). For example, cases have been reported in which people were renting property
when their house was demolished. Even after the demolition, the landlords reportedly continued to
charge them rent (Deng 2010). In rural areas, the situation is similar. The Land Act requires
pastoralists and other groups with secondary rights of access to be consulted in any decision that
may affect their rights. In practice, however, groups with secondary rights are often excluded from
negotiations and when land is expropriated and transferred to private interests, their secondary
rights are often not adequately taken into account (Deng, Johansson and Narula 2010).

When compensation is provided, it is usually given within a year. Representatives of the Ministry of
Roads and Bridges, for example, said that compensation for people whose land was expropriated to
build a new bridge over the Nile got their land within one year. Representatives of the Juba City
Council also noted that compensation is typically quite prompt. However, the shortage of available
land around Juba causes numerous difficulties in finding alternative land to provide as
compensation, and as a result compensation is often delayed indefinitely (see LGI-14, Dim. iii).
Data is not currently available for the promptness of compensation for expropriations that occur
outside of Juba.

Appealing Expropriations

Independent avenues to lodge a complaint against an expropriation are only accessible to a small
segment of the population (LGI-14, Dim. iv). Individuals and groups with financial means may
contest expropriations through judicial actions. In Feburary 2013, for example, a group of traders in
Nimule, along the South Sudan-Uganda border, took the Government of South Sudan to court in
order to stop a demolition ordered by the Deputy Minister of the Interior (Sudan Trib. 2013d). The
land was being expropriated to establish offices for the customs department, but the traders
complained that they were not given adequate notice and the compensation had not been provided
for. Another example can be seen in a planned expropriation in a neighborhood in Juba called Hai
Kassava, where people’s land was being expropriated in order to transfer it to a private investor.
According to panel participants, residents of the area filed a complaint in court and convinced a
judge to grant an injunction stopping the eviction. The investor, however, appealed the decision and
the appeals court overturned the lower court ruling, allowing the project proponents to proceed with
the demolition.

For most populations, contesting expropriations in court is inaccessible either in terms of cost or
geographic proximity. Statutory courts have only been established in a fraction of the 79 counties of
South Sudan and are not geographically accessible to populations in many rural areas. Other
possible avenues of complaint include the submission of complaints through administrative
processes, such as complaining directly to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure. Government
officials acknowledge, however, that the chances of such complaints succeeding are fairly low.
Communities also sometimes try to leverage their networks to the government by submitting letters
to senior politicians seeking in an effort to stop expropriations. As discussed in Section 3.6,
communities opposing agreements made without their consent have had some notable success at
stopping land deals in recent years.

Public Land Transactions

Auctions or public tenders for land transactions are rare or nonexistent in South Sudan (LGI-15,
Dim. i). The vast majority of companies seeking to do business on public land negotiate agreements
in a bilateral manner directly with the government institutions. Aside from a few isolated examples,
information on the extent to which payments for public leases are collected is not available (LGI-
15, Dim. ii and iii). In one example, discussed further in relation to LSLA-6 below, a company
investing in a timber plantation promised to pay $100,000 USD to a social fund for affected
communities. The company only paid $79,000 of this amount before selling the venture to a
subsequent investor (Deng 2011a). At this writing, the community had still not received the
remaining amount.

3.4 Public Provision of Land Information
The Public Provision of Land Information theme assesses South Sudan’s land information systems.
It covers four indicators that are assessed using 13 dimensions. The first two indicators (LGI-16 and
LGI-17) focus on the relevance, completeness and reliability of information in the land registry. The
other two indicators (LGI-18 and LGI-19) address the cost-effectiveness, sustainability and
transparency of land administration services.

Land Registries

Land registries vary from location to location in South Sudan. The most developed registries are
found in the three regional centers of Juba, Wau and Malakal. In these three locations, state-level
Ministries of Physical Infrastructure and High Courts share joint responsibility over the registration
process: the Ministries conduct survey activities and issue land leases and the Courts register
leaseholders. Information in the registry is recorded in handwritten documents and there are no
efforts underway to computerize the system. Data regarding the number of documents in the
registries is not currently available. According to panel participants, other towns have begun
developing registration processes in recent years, but there is little information available on how
these other registration processes function.

The 2009 Land Act introduced several changes to the administration of the registry. It called for the
registry is meant to be housed in the executive branch and administered by the RSS Ministry of
Housing and Physical Planning in coordination with the state-level Ministries of Housing and the
County Land Authorities at the local government level. Despite the change in law, however, the
land registry still remains at the High Court and there are no immediate plans to relocate it to the
RSS Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning.

There is no single reason for the failure to implement the change called for in the Land Act. To a
certain extent, the reluctance to move the registry may reflect the weak rule of law in South Sudan
and the skepticism many people hold towards the Land Act. It may also point towards a paralysis
that governance institutions are experiencing in the face of skyrocketing demand for land and
widespread disputes. Senior officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure have maintained
that they do not want the registry to be housed with them because of all the disputes that are arising
with respect to land. It is also possible that institutional power dynamics are playing a role. Control
of the land registry carries with it control over the land distribution process, and individuals who are
benefiting from the status quo may not be eager to change the institutional framework.

Completeness of the Land Registry

There are several fundamental information gaps in the land registries. The first concerns the lack of
a registry at the national level, which would maintain information about registered landholdings in
the country as a whole. Without a national registry, it is difficult for the Government to monitor the
performance of the system and enforce national regulatory standards.

A second shortcoming relates to the type of information recorded in the registry. According to the
Land Act, the registry should include “all current encumbrances, charges, restrictions, conditions

                                                  59
                                                                                                        DRAFT
and other interests whether benefiting or burdening the land to which the certificate of title rel ates.”
This information is not being recorded in the existing registries. As a result, there is no way to
easily identify whether a particular parcel of land is subject to mortgages, loans, liens, subleases,
lawsuits or other encumbrances (LGI-16, Dim. ii). Nor are restrictive covenants, easements or
public land use restrictions recorded (LGI-16, Dim. iii).

A third shortcoming relates to the types of maps in the registries. According to panel participants,
the registries do not include comprehensive maps of registered landholdings (LGI-16, Dim. i).
Sketches showing the dimensions of individual plots are sometimes attached to the land leases, but
most registered land in Juba has not yet been surveyed and demarcated and many registered plots do
not even have sketches attached. Community formalization processes outside of the formal
government process (see LGI-3 above) are often done without creating maps. When maps are
developed, they are typically maintained at the community level with only a small number of people
granted access. State authorities have discussed the possibility of developing the individual sketches
into a proper cadastral map with geo-reference points and information on plots and owners, but
concrete plans for doing so have not yet been agreed upon.

Searchability and Accessibility of Documents in the Registry

The registry is searchable by plot number or landholder (LGI-16, Dim. iv), but access to this
information is tightly guarded. If an individual has documents showing that he or she has rights to a
particular plot of land, the staff at the land registry will allow the person to access information about
their plot only. Information is not accessible to the public or to other government institutions.

Time is also a concern. The process of obtaining information can take a prohibitively long time
(LGI-16, Dim. vi). Registry staff face high demands for information from leaseholders and they are
poorly trained. According to public officials and INGO representatives, the process of obtaining
information only proceeds quickly when bribes are paid. Without bribes, the process can drag on for
months. As noted above, the problems include a high demand for information, poorly trained staff,
missing documents, and documents that are distributed among many different offices. As a result,
people usually hire a lawyer or another intermediary to expedite the process (LGI-16, Dim v). This
can significantly raise the cost of accessing land information and restrict access for people who do
not have the means to hire a lawyer.

Reliability of Records in the Registry (LGI-17)

Condition of the Registry and Service Standards

According to panel participants, registry staff suffer from a chronic inability to produce land
records, suggesting a high degree of clerical errors in the registry and discrepancies between the

                                                      60

information recorded in the registry and realities on the ground (LGI-17, Dim. ii). Documents in the
registry are also poorly maintained and subject to deterioration from dust and exposure to the
elements.

There are no service standards governing the performance of land registry staff and complaints
about a lack of professionalism are common (LGI-17, Dim. i). In 2009, a clerk in the land registry
department was caught illegally issuing plots in collaboration with individuals in the Ministry of
Physical Infrastructure and the Land Survey Department (Deng 2010). The individual was
reportedly transferred to another department but not prosecuted. In another example from Wau in
2010, an administrator in the Western Bahr-el-Ghazal Ministry of Physical Infrastructure reportedly
burned a sizeable portion of the registration documents out of frustration with all the land disputes
that were coming to his office. These examples are indicative of a more general failure to monitor
customer service in the registry.

Part of the problem can be traced to a lack of human resources. Registry staff have not been trained
on how to maintain information and manage interactions with the public. More fundamentally, there
is no culture or practice of recording this type of land information. During the colonial era and after
Sudan’s independence in 2005, the main landholdings that were registered were those belonging to
British and northern Sudanese administrators. Previous national governments in Sudan did not
devote much attention to land administration in southern Sudan and most South Sudanese residing
in informal settlements in and around urban areas paid little attention to recording their rights.
Economically relevant encumbrances did not exist in any formal way so there was no need to record
them.

Registering Property Transfers

The cost of registering a property transfer is much higher than first-time registration through the
official government process. As noted in Table 10, fees for first-time registration are typically in
the range of $100 USD, excluding any informal payments that might be required. The typical fee to
process a land transfer in Juba, by contrast, is 10 percent of the property value (LGI-18, Dim. i).
With undeveloped first class plots in Juba selling for approximately $20,000 USD or more, the
costs of registering the transfer can reach $2,000 USD. Similarly high fees were reported in
Western Equatoria State.

Once a person has purchased leasehold rights to a particular plot of land, they must renew their
lease annually and pay a fee. If they fail to renew, they are made to pay 50 percent of all the years
that have been missed. The rules governing renewal of leases have raised problems with property
transfers as many property transfers involve leases that have not been renewed for many years.
When new lessees seek to have the transfer registered, they are sometimes asked to pay the 50
percent fine for all the years of missed renewal. Data regarding the percentage of leases that people
fail to renew is not currently available.

Sustainability of the Land Registry

According to officials in the CES Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, revenue generated through fee
collection in the land registry in Juba follows a similar pattern to revenue collection in other sectors.
Forty percent of the revenue is retained within the registry and 60 percent is sent to the CES
Ministry of Finance. The registry seems to rely on disbursements from the state and central
government to function (LGI-18, Dim. iii), but it also remits some revenue to the higher branches of
government, suggesting that some amount of budgetary surplus is generated from fees (LGI-18,
Dim. ii). For the registration of leases and the conduct of survey activities, budgets fall under the
CES Ministry of Physical Infrastructure. The budgets of the land registry in the High Court fall
under the Judiciary. Neither institution was able to make budgetary information available to
researchers.

Schedule of Fees and Mechanisms to Detect Illegal Behavior

It is not clear whether a schedule of fees for different land administration services exist or not.
Several government and INGO representatives interviewed for this study maintained that a schedule
of fees exists, but that it is not readily available to the public in any written form (LGI-19, Dim. i).
At the land registry in Juba, an official interviewed for this study was able to narrate the fees for
different classes of land, though he was not sure about the fees charged by other institutions.

As noted in relation to LGI-17, Dim. i, there are a large number of fraudulent transactions in the
land administration system and government staff or intermediaries are sometimes complicit in the
wrongdoing. Mechanisms to detect and deal with illegal staff behavior are largely non-existent
(LGI-19, Dim. ii).

The Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management theme assesses the accessibility and coherence of
existing mechanisms for resolving land-related disputes. It covers two indicators that are assessed
using seven dimensions. The first indicator (LGI-20) focuses on the affordability, clarity,
transparency and objectivity of dispute resolution processes. The second indicator (LGI-21)
examines the efficiency of these mechanisms based on the number of land-related conflicts pending
in the system.

Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

South Sudan has a pluralist legal system that incorporates parallel systems of statutory and
customary courts. The 2008 Judiciary Act structures the statutory courts in a single hierarchy,
starting with the Supreme Court at the national level, followed by three regional courts of appeals,
and high courts in the capitals of each of the ten states. At the local government level, the Judiciary
Act envisages county courts and payam courts in all of the counties and payams. However, only a
fraction of county courts have been established and there is not yet a single payam-level statutory
court in South Sudan.

Statutory courts are only geographically accessible in and around urban areas. In rural areas, where
87 percent of the population resides, customary courts are the main institutions of dispute
resolution. As Tiernan Mennen (2012) notes:

            Chiefs are overwhelmingly responsible for the administration of justice throughout the 10 states [of South
            Sudan], and the customary court system handles the vast majority of disputes, according to customary law.

Land disputes involving registered landholdings in urban areas are typically adjudicated in the
formal system at the level of the high court. In locations that have experienced large numbers of
disputes, high court judges have channeled land disputes to the county courts. Disputes involving
unregistered landholdings are usually dealt with in customary courts or through mediations with
community leaders.

                                                           63
                                                                                                                  DRAFT
In addition to the relatively more standardized system of statutory and customary courts, local
authorities in certain areas sometimes use ad hoc complaint mechanisms to address different types
of land disputes. For example, Mennen (Id.) cites an example from Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal and
Warrap States where chiefs formed a community committee to resolve disputes where returnees
were claiming family land that was occupied by someone else. The committees were composed of
elders from the community, appointed by the chiefs, that knew the history of the area and could
verify claims of family inheritance to land. Disputants were encouraged to bring witnesses to the
committee and customary court that could testify on their behalf as rightful, longtime owners of the
land. The decisions from the committees would then inform the chiefs’ decision in the customary
court. In some urban areas, local authorities known as sheikh al hilla also play a role in dispute
resolution.

           Text Box 7: Formality and Informality in Statutory and Customary Courts
 Formality and informality are fluid concepts in South Sudan. While customary courts are less formal than their
 statutory counterparts, they nonetheless have a legal foundation in the 2011 Transitional Constitution and the 2008
 Civil Procedure Act. Customary court decisions are based primarily on the unwritten customs and traditions of
 people within their jurisdiction, but they can also apply criminal statute to certain matters. Similarly, statutory courts
 can apply customary law, particularly to those disputes involving divorce, elopement and marriage. As such, South
 Sudan’s justice system does not easily lend itself to the clear conceptual distinction between formal and informal
 institutions.


Assignment of Responsibility for Dispute Resolution

The jurisdictions of statutory and customary courts are described in the 2008 Judiciary Act and the
2009 Local Government Act, in practice, responsibility for dispute resolution is distributed across
many different forums, court rulings are shared in an ad hoc manner, if at all, and the entire process
is poorly coordinated (see LGI-20, Dim. iii). The problems are particularly pronounced as disputing
parties move between the statutory and customary systems.

To a certain extent, the uncertainties in the allocation of responsibility over land disputes in the
judicial system can be traced to legislative ambiguities in the administrative structure of customary
and statutory courts. Whereas statutory courts lie firmly within the national Judiciary, customary
courts fall under the Ministry of Local Government at the state level, an executive institution. This
mixture of centralized statutory courts and decentralized customary courts serves to widen the gulf
between the two systems. Chiefs also play both executive and judicial roles, which raises separation
of powers issues. Furthermore, Ministries of Local Government are often under resourced and do
not have the expertise to monitor and regulate the legal aspects of customary courts.

For family disputes, such as those relating to inheritance or the distribution of property upon
divorce, custom is often applied to the suit whether it is brought in customary or statutory courts
(see LGI-20, Dim. ii). According to Section 6 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure Act:

      Where a suit or other proceeding in a Civil Court raises a question regarding succession, inheritance, legacies,
      gifts, marriage, divorce, or family relations, the rule for decision of such question shall be:

          (a) Any custom applicable to the parties concerned; provided that, it is not contrary to justice, equity or
              good conscience and has not been by this, or any other enactment, altered or abolished or has not been
              declared void by the decision of a competent Court; or,

          (b) The Sharia Law in cases where the parties are Muslims except so far as it has been modified by such
               custom as is above referred to.

The application of customary law to these types of disputes makes it difficult for women to enforce

                                                                                                              DRAFT
their constitutional or statutory rights, even in statutory courts. The poor coordination among the
systems also causes additional complications, in that women who receive favorable decisions in
customary or statutory courts may find that their husbands or male relatives resurrect the dispute in
another court that does not recognize the initial court’s ruling (SIHA 2012).

Constraints on the Enforcement of Judicial Decisions

Both customary and statutory courts face serious constraints in enforcing their decisions. In urban
areas, this enforcement gap is most apparent in the unlawful appropriation of land by individuals
who wield political or military authority. According to Sara Pantuliano (2009):

       [Land grabbing by military personnel or powerful members of the community] concerns both returnees and
       residents as a number of long-term residents are losing their land to soldiers occupying it by force. In a number
       of cases, long-term residents have lost their land to well-off returnees, who have used the military to force
       owners to give up their property. Land ownership documents mean little when threatened by a gun.

People who receive favorable decisions in statutory courts are often unable to enforce them, as court
decisions are typically carried out by a small number of court police who are not able to enforce
court orders on well-armed military personnel.

Courts in rural areas also face certain intractable disputes. For example, a number of county
administrations have begun implementing plans to redevelop and redesign towns in the county
headquarters. Citizens routinely protest the expropriation of their land without prior consultation or
compensation to affected individuals and communities, and these development initiatives have
greatly affected tenure security for populations in rural areas who have been subject to seizure of
their property for the purposes of building roads and marketplaces.

Court Fees

The amount charged in court fees in the formal system is a major barrier for many people involved
in land-related disputes. Court fees vary according to the size of the claim at hand and there is no
uniform schedule of fees available at most statutory courts. Typical court fees can range from five
to ten percent of the value of the land and can reach as high as $1,250 to $2,500 USD. Other
informal fees may be required to expedite the process. Litigants must also pay for the services of an
advocate, typically in the range of $750 to $1,000 USD, though courts can force the other party to
pay those costs in damage awards. Customary courts are more affordable, but they typically do not
have jurisdiction over disputes involving registered lands.

Appeals Process

South Sudanese procedural law provides the parties to a dispute with fourteen days to appeal a
ruling. However, there are numerous ambiguities and inefficiencies in the appeals process (see LGI-
20, Dim. iv). This is particularly true of the customary courts where traditional authorities do not
always abide by decisions reached by other customary and statutory courts. This practice leaves
room for parties to resurrect decisions in alternative forums if they are not content with a court
decision. As mentioned above, this often has a disproportionate impact on women who may decide
to pursue a case through one court only to find that a disgruntled spouse or family member has
summoned her to another hearing in a different court. Although, South Sudanese law proscribes
statutes of limitations and time periods for appeals, these laws are not consistently enforced.

Ultimately, these problems translate into a long drawn out and poorly coordinated appeals. For
example, it is not uncommon for parties to a dispute to wait several years for their cases to be heard
in appeals courts. In other instances, an appeals court judge will reach a decision based on the lower

                                                         65
                                                                                                           DRAFT
court transcripts, without even notifying the parties involved or allowing them to submit arguments.
Court fees for land disputes, whether for cases being heard in the first instance or those being heard
on appeal, vary according to the value of the land. For example, according to a representative of an
INGO familiar with the court system in Yambio, the judges charge the complainant party 10 percent
of the amount that the party is asking for in his or her complaint as court fees. These fees often
result in prohibitive costs for parties seeking to resolve their disputes in the formal system.

Corruption within the Judiciary can also cause delays in the appeals process, particularly for people
who are unable to pay bribes. According to an advocate working in Juba, the only way to hasten the
appeals process is to pay informal fees, which often exceed the costs of court fees and legal
representation combined.

                                 Text Box 8: Challenges in the Judiciary
 Much of the courts’ failure to resolve land-related disputes in a timely manner can be attributed to certain
 weaknesses in the Judiciary itself. The Judiciary is severely understaffed, not having hired any new judges over a
 seven-year period from 2006 to 2013. Corruption is also a systematic problem. In March 2013, Justice John
 Clement Kuc announced that he was resigning from the Judiciary due to nepotism and a lack of transparency, citing
 both a hostile working environment and interference from the executive branch, which hindered him from carrying
 out his work effectively (Sudan Trib. 2013).


Access in the Customary System

Customary courts are considered to be more accessible than statutory courts in several respects
(LGI-20, Dim. i). Whereas statutory courts are mainly accessible only in urban areas, customary
courts are found in urban and rural areas throughout the country. Customary courts are also more
affordable than statutory courts. Fees in customary courts are not closely monitored and amounts
can vary widely, but they are nearly always several orders of magnitude cheaper than statutory
courts. In locations where chiefs are paid a salary by the government, customary court fees tend to
be a bit lower. In locations where chiefs do not receive salaries from the government, court fees are
often higher, because they serve as a primary source of revenue for chiefs. In some circumstances,
customary court fees may be perceived as prohibitive, particularly for marginalized or
disadvantaged populations such as women-headed households, IDPs or returnees, but for the most
part, market forces and opportunities for forum shopping keep fees in customary courts within the
realm of affordability for most South Sudanese (Leonardi et al. 2010).

Customary courts are also more culturally accessible to the majority of South Sudanese. Since
customary courts base their decisions primarily on local norms, their reasoning tends to be more
predictable for people who are less familiar with statutory court proceedings. Customary court
hearings can also be conducted in the vernacular, whereas statutory court hearings are often
conducted in Arabic or English, which are unfamiliar languages for many people residing in rural
areas. That being said, access to conflict resolution mechanisms at both the statutory and customary
levels is often hampered by a lack of awareness amongst citizens about the formal and informal
procedures for managing land disputes.

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

In resolving land disputes, the 2009 Land Act gives priority to alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
and traditional dispute resolution mechanisms. It also lays out basic standards governing mediations
and arbitrations and how these dispute resolution mechanisms relate to the other local institutions of
land governance. One of the benefits of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in relation to land
disputes is that the parties have a bit more flexibility in the type of evidence that they can provide.
Whereas formal courts are focused almost exclusively on documentary forms of evidence, in

                                                        66

mediations or arbitrations people can draw on all different sorts of evidence to prove their claims.
There are also benefits in terms of reduced cost, more timely resolution and the maintenance of
social relationships that might otherwise be damaged through adversarial court proceedings.

Panel participants recounted a number of ad hoc dispute resolution processes that make use of ADR
techniques, albeit without explicit reference to the Land Act. In Munuki, Rajaf and Kator payams of
Juba, for example, committees of three to five members sit every Friday to mediate land disputes. In
Maridi, there is a county land committee chaired by the County Commissioner that sits to resolve
land disputes on a regular basis. Another example can be seen in a dispute between the Acholi and
Madi in Magwi. A group of elders convened a forum that sat in Torit for a week to address the issue
and came out with a series of their own resolutions. Initiatives such as these perform an important
function in areas where the statutory or customary court system is unable to effectively manage land
disputes.

                                         Text Box 9: Evidentiary Standards
 Many land documents were lost or destroyed during the war, and those who took refuge in other countries have
 returned home to find secondary or tertiary occupants settled on their land. Without documentation to substantiate
 their claims, hearings can drag on for years. In one example recounted by a panel participant, an individual who was
 displaced from his home in 1987 returned in 2004 to find that someone else had inhabited his land. Immediately
 thereafter, the individual brought a complaint in court; the complaint it is still pending to this day.

 Another panel participant recounted a case in which a man did not have documents to his land, but he had been
 residing in that place for a long time. During the war, the man had been given a token to process the documents for
 his land. He gave the token to his brother who was an alcoholic and unstable. The brother gave the token to a friend
 who proceeded to register the land in his name, saying that the brother had sold the land to him. When the case went
 to the high court, the judge did not accept any non-documentary evidence. The man’s grandparents and parents were
 buried in the land, he had constructed a house, and the neighbors were available to testify on his behalf. But the
 court only based its decision on the documents, which were in the other man’s possession.

Caseloads and Disposal Rates

Information regarding court caseloads and disposal rates is not readily available in South Sudan.
Part of the difficulty of obtaining this information can be attributed to a general lack of transparency
in the Judiciary. Since the Government of South Sudan was established in 2005, the Judiciary has
not published a single judicial opinion. To the extent that the Judiciary monitors statistics on types

of cases that are heard and how long it takes to dispose of different types of cases, that information
is not made available to the public.

With respect to land disputes, some government and civil society actors have provided estimates
that help to shed light on the frequency with which land disputes arise in certain areas. For example,
according to an assessment carried out by the South Sudan Land Commission (SSLC), between
2008 and 2010, 80 to 85 percent of the cases arising in the statutory courts in Yei involved land
disputes. A representative of the Information, Counseling and Legal Assistance (ICLA) Program of
the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) estimate that approximately 60 to 70 percent of the cases
arising in statutory courts in Juba involve land disputes. Greater Bahr-el-Ghazal, Wau and Aweil
have also experienced a dramatic increase in land disputes associated with populations of returnees
and refugees. The problem is pronounced in Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, where there is only one
statutory judge to cover the whole state. In other locations, there may be very few land cases. For
example, according to panel participants, Kajokeji has very few land disputes other than matters
having to do with the demarcation of administrative boundaries.

The most prevalent disputes are those involving IDPs and returnees that reside in informal
settlements in Juba. Issues relating to demolitions and forced evictions, in addition to disputes over
competing claims and documentation are also commonplace. Matters relating to inheritance arise
with less frequency. These issues are typically addressed within the family or sometimes in
customary courts, but do not typically make it into the formal system. This can have adverse effects
on women and children who may be disadvantaged within family mediation or customary courts
which tend to be male-dominated arenas.

Statutory court hearings for land disputes can drag on for up to six months, a year, or longer (LGI-
21, Dim. ii). Many disputes date back to the civil war period. When people were displaced from
their homes as a result of the conflict, secondary occupants would often move on to the land.
Oftentimes, state and local government officials were transferred title to new owners without
providing notice to the original inhabitants. Disputes in which both parties have valid documents
tend to be very difficult to resolve. The courts have found it particularly difficult to resolve disputes
involving military personnel that have unlawfully settled on other people’s land. At one point, the
Judiciary had solicited the support of the Military Justice system in enforcing its decisions on
military personnel, but according to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Military Justice no
longer assists in enforcing decisions from civilian courts.

3.6 Large-scale Acquisition of Land Rights
The Large-scale Acquisition of Land Rights theme assesses a range of land governance issues
relating to land acquisitions. The theme covers land-based investments in agriculture, forestry,
biofuels, carbon credits and ecotourism, but it does not directly address investments in the oil and
mining industries. The theme has 16 indicators. The first four indicators (LSLA 1 to LSLA 4) focus
on issues pertaining to rights recognition, land conflicts and land use planning. The next seven
(LSLA 5 to LSLA 11) indicators address various issues relating to land investments, including
incentives, benefit sharing arrangements, the transparency of negotiations and contracting. The next
two indicators (LSLA 12 and LSLA 13) focus on environmental and social safeguards. The final
three indicators (LSLA 14 and LSLA 16) assess institutional capacity and coordination.

Post-CPA Land Investments

South Sudan experienced an influx of large-scale land-based investment following the signing of
CPA in 2005. Many of these investments in commercial farms, plantation forestry, biofuel projects,
carbon credit schemes and ecotourism projects went largely unnoticed by the government and civil
society. Companies seeking first-mover advantages secured leasehold rights in some of the most
fertile and water-rich regions of the country. For the most part, however, they held off investing
large amounts of money into developing the property, preferring to wait until the political
uncertainty of the interim period and South Sudan’s 2011 referendum on self-determination had
passed. As a result, although large areas of land were sought or secured by private actors —more
than eight percent of South Sudan’s total land area, according to a 2011 study—there was relatively
little evidence of investment activity on the ground (Deng 2011b).

Disputes over large-scale land acquisitions are relatively common in both urban and rural areas (see
LSLA 2). There is no clear process for managing these disputes. In some cases, communities have
opened cases in statutory courts, either locally in the state where the acquisition took place or in
Juba. In other cases, such as those described above, senior politicians will sometimes intervene try
to mediate disputes before they become too heated. Disputes can simmer for years without
resolution and carry a high potential for violence. In Kapoeta, for example, a group of Didinga
reportedly shot above the heads of a group of investors that were coming to the area to explore
opportunities for gold production (Nakimongole 2012). As the political and economic situation in
South Sudan stabilizes, infrastructure begins to develop, and the country becomes a more attractive
destination for capital, investments will become far more visible. If the increased investment is not
tied to tangible benefits for local populations, there is a risk that it could lead to further disputes.

 In 2008, an American company acquired rights to 600,000 hectares of land in Mukaya Payam about 70 kilometers
 from Juba, through a deal with a small number of community leaders and the CES government. The project was
 focused mainly on agriculture, timber and biofuel production. People residing in the area did not learn of the deal
 until 2011. After learning of the lease agreement, the community sent a committee comprised of parliamentarians,
 payam officials, chiefs, and government officials to Juba to meet with the CES governor and the President.
 According to the committee spokesperson (Wudu 2011): “This land lease was done in the absence of the
 community. It has taken three years since its deal started in 2008 for the Community to learn. Influential natives of
 Mukaya Payam who claimed to be the community representatives of the people of Mukaya carried out the deal. ”

Benefit Sharing Mechanisms

The Transitional Constitution and Land Act include several broad provisions that recognize the
right of communities to benefit from investments on their land. According to the Transitional
Constitution:

        Communities and persons enjoying rights in land shall be consulted and their views duly taken into account in
        decisions to develop subterranean natural resources in the area in which they have rights; they shall share in

                                                         70
                                                                                                          DRAFT
       the benefits of that development.

The Land Act states that investment activities must reflect an “important interest” for the affected
community and should contribute to the community’s economic and social development.

In practice, however, the mechanisms for securing public benefits are not consistently applied and
the nonperformance of investment obligations is a common problem (see LSLA 6). In many cases,
benefits for the people residing in the area come in the form of infrastructure, services or
employment opportunities. Often, company obligations are put in vague and non-binding contract
provisions, such as the following provision from an agreement between the RSS Ministry of
Wildlife and an Emirati company:

       The Company undertakes, as far as is practically possible and financially feasible, to ensure that local
       community interests are considered in full. A Joint Liaison Committee will be established with the local
       communities and existing community based organizations (CBOs) which will meet on a quarterly basis. Local
       communities will be the primary beneficiaries of employment opportunities and they will receive other
       economic benefits. The Company intends to establish a structure and/or support the existing not-for-profit
       organizations together with third parties which will focus on the establishment of small businesses and the
       creation of wealth in the surrounding communities…

Another example of more direct benefit sharing can be found in several teak concessions that the
Government of South Sudan provided to a number of foreign-owned companies. The following
provision is similar to one found in a number of government agreements with timber companies:

    The concessionaire will pay an amount of USD 100,000 into a social fund account. The money will be spent on
    community development projects as will be determined with stake holding communities at the second stakeholders
    meeting not later than 6 months after the signing of this agreement. …A further social fund contribution will be
    paid by the Concessionaire into a community fund at a rate of USD 5 per cubic meter (m3) of sawn board
    exported.

According to a member of a local development committee, the company only paid $79,000 USD
out of the $100,000 USD that it owed to the community before selling the venture to another firm
(Deng 2011a).

Lease Amounts

Lease amounts vary considerably across projects and across business sectors. In some cases, land
may be provided to investors at little or no cost, the assumption being that people will benefit from
employment opportunities if the investment materializes. For example, a foreign company obtained
a 99-year lease for 179,000 hectares in order to establish a timber plantation and conservation
project in Central Equatoria for just $12,500 USD per year ($0.07 USD per ha per year). In another
example from Unity State, a company agreed to pay $125,000 USD per year to the state
government for a 25-year lease of 105,000 hectares land for commercial agriculture (Deng 2011a).
Information about land leases for industrial purposes in urban and peri-urban areas is not readily
available, but it can be reasonably assumed that the prices are higher than those encountered in rural
areas.

 In June 2013, the Government of South Sudan announced that it would be starting the construction of a Special
 Economic Zone (SEZ) on a 625 square kilometer parcel of land in a place called Lokiri, approximately 30
 kilometers from Juba (Sudan Trib. 2013a). The SEZ is meant to serve as an industrial area for business and
 investment activities. Speaking at the ground breaking ceremony, the Minister of Commerce, Industry and
 Investment remarked:

       “Provision of these kind of infrastructure and availability of others such as tax incentive, non-tariff barriers,
       power, roads and access to finance will pave the way for more investments to consider South Sudan as one
       of best investment destinations in the region if not the world.”

 While most of the community supported the project and hoped it would help to bring goods and services to the area,
 at least one group complained that proper consultations were not done and that the community was not compensated
 for the land.


Investment Negotiations

The Land Act is a very broad piece of legislation that purports to establish rules and procedures
across a wide range of issues. In relation to land investments, the Land Act states that upon
completion of an investment project, the leased land must revert back to the community.
Expropriation is not explicitly required in law, but often the process is one in which the
government, often at the state level, negotiates agreements in closed-door discussions with
companies, only notifying affected populations after the agreement has been concluded (see LSLA
7). The examples provided in relation to LSLA 2 are indicative of many investments in South
Sudan (Deng 2011b).

A central difficulty in negotiations between companies and communities is defining the
‘community’ and those who are able to make legally binding promises on its behalf. In several
circumstances, companies and government institutions have reached agreements with a few
community leaders residing in urban centers far away from the land in question, and then claimed
that they have consulted the community. Negotiations are rarely done before agreements are signed
and most do not devote special attention to securing the participation of women, minority groups,
displaced persons, pastoralists, or other marginalized groups (Deng 2011c).

Information Disclosure

Transparency is a central concern for large-scale land investments in South Sudan. According to the
Transitional Constitution:

       Every citizen has the right of access to official information and records, including electronic records in the
       possession of any level of government or any organ or agency thereof, except where the release of such
       information is likely to prejudice public security or the right to privacy of any other person.

In practice, however, access to documents associated with investment agreements is largely subject
to the discretion of the people involved. Government actors and companies often refuse to share
even basic information about investments (LSLA 9). A new Right of Access to Information Bill
tabled before the National Legislative Assembly in 2012 could help to give meaning to the right to
information that is expressed in the Transitional Constitution. However, given the weaknesses in the
rule of law in South Sudan, any such legislation would likely require a great deal of support to
effect any meaningful changes in government practice.

To a certain degree, the lack of oversight and monitoring of government institutions involved in
land investments is a consequence of the decentralization of land governance in South Sudan. Most
land investments are negotiated and signed at the state level. Sometimes the national government
itself is not aware of leases—some of which involve exceedingly large areas of land—that are
                                                          72
                                                                                                DRAFT
entered into at the state level. State governors have entered into agreements with foreign companies
for agricultural ventures without making public the terms and conditions of the agreement. Without
any pressure from the national executive to make this information public, state governors are able to
restrict information about investments that could affect land use patterns for tens of thousands of
people (Deng 2011b).

In this non-transparent environment, there are serious concerns of corruption in relation to large-
scale land investments. The Government of South Sudan has struggled with widespread corruption
and impunity since its creation in 2005. A few high profile scandals have surfaced in the eight years
since the signing of the peace agreement, but the issue has not been rigorously documented and it is
difficult to obtain credible information on the scale or type of corruption, especially as it relates to
land investments.

Government Vetting of Investment Proposals

In addition to the lack of transparency discussed above, government institutions themselves do not
always obtain the necessary information to assess the viability and benefits from projects (LSLA 8).
To a certain extent, the inability to acquire and process the information is a product of human
resource constraints in government institutions. In this respect, there is a degree of variability across
business sectors. For example, the Government of South Sudan has more technical expertise in
forestry than in carbon credits or biofuels. South Sudan’s teak plantations date back to the colonial
era and there are a sizeable number of foresters in the country, some of whom have degrees from
universities in Khartoum or elsewhere in East Africa.

Carbon credit and biofuel markets, however, are unfamiliar terrain to most South Sudanese and the
public sector personnel lack the expertise to adequately assess investments in these sectors. The
imbalances of information between the public and private sector complicate efforts to secure good
faith negotiations. For example, a foreign company hoping to implement a carbon credit project in
Central Equatoria negotiated an agreement in which the company pledged to provide 10 percent of
revenue from its venture into projects in the local community. This benefit sharing arrangement was
in line with company policy but it was not the subject of negotiations with the CES Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry or the affected communities. Nor did company representatives disclose to
any of the other signatories the amount of revenue that they expected to receive from carbon credits.

There is also a degree of geographical variation in the type of information that the Government
requires from investors. As of 2010 in Western Equatoria State, for example, government teak
concessions were subject to debate in the state legislative assembly prior to approval (Id.). This
additional level of oversight required the government to produce additional information on the types
of benefits that the Government expected to receive from the investment. Parliamentary oversight
was required by a state legal adviser; there was no clear regulatory standard requiring it by law.

Delay in Transferring Land to its Destined Use

Expropriations for private investments in rural areas can take an exceedingly long time to be
transferred to their destined use. To a certain extent, the delay can be traced to a reluctance on the
part of investors to devote capital towards developing their newly acquired landholdings. Given the
high levels of political, economic and social risk associated with investments in South Sudan,
investors often avoid devoting much capital towards immoveable assets in the country. As a result,
even though the government may have signed lease agreements purporting to transfer large parcels
of community land to private interests, very little evidence of investment activity is apparent on the

example of a company that completed the tender process three years ago but had still not begun
construction activities.

Time Taken to Obtain Approval

Due to the ambiguity of the legal framework, the procedure for acquiring land is excessively long.
Company representatives commonly complain that after they have reached an agreement with one
government institution, another institution nullifies the deal. Companies can wait for years before
obtaining approval for the investment. Even after receiving approval, government institutions may
still back out of agreements.

The Government’s failure to fulfill investment obligations can be partly attributed to resource
constraints. However, it is also a product of the government’s underdeveloped international legal
personality. The Government of South Sudan has not signed any international investment treaties,
which would provide companies with a legal recourse to international arbitration if they feel that
they have had their property unlawfully expropriated. Since governments typically enjoy sovereign
immunity in foreign jurisdictions it can be difficult or impossible for companies to sue the
Government of South Sudan and achieve enforceable remedies outside of the country.

Social and Environmental Protections

South Sudanese law requires that companies investing in South Sudan meet a number of social and
environmental standards. According to the Land Act:

        Any allocation of land for investment purposes shall be subject to a social, economic and environmental
        impact assessment to ensure that the social, economic and environmental implications of the activities on the
        land are taken into account before any decision is made thereon.

In practice, companies rarely conduct environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs); nor
are they required to do so by government institutions (LSLA 12 and 13). Of 28 investments
discussed in a 2011 report on land-based investment in South Sudan, none of the companies
conducted an ESIA prior to finalizing its agreement with the government. Some companies
conducted ESIAs after the investment agreement was finalized and others outlined social and
environmental concerns in feasibility studies, but none conducted prior ESIAs as required by the
Land Act (Deng 2011b).

Requirements for prior consultation with affected communities are also routinely ignored. Both the
Land Act and the Local Government Act (2009) require prior consultation with affected
                                                         74

communities. The Land Act also requires that government officials and company representatives
consult pastoralist groups with secondary rights of access before making any decision that would
affect their grazing rights. Of the 17 foreign investments examined in a 2011 study on land-based
investment, only two companies conducted prior consultations with affected populations (Deng
2011b).

Government Oversight

The responsibility for identifying beneficial projects is distributed across various institutions at each
level of government, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Investment, the Ministry of Wildlife, Conservation and Tourism, and the Ministry of
the Environment. Some areas, such as the Greater Equatoria region in the south of the country, tend
to be better connected to international markets and therefore attract greater investor interest. In
other areas, particularly those prone to insecurity, investments are few and far between and state
officials are often less willing to turn away investments, even if the benefits are sharply skewed in
favor of the investor. Regardless of the amount of investor interest, the procedures for assessing
investment plans tend to be ad hoc and subject to a high degree of political interference (see LSLA
14) (Deng 2011a).

Investment monitoring is severely lacking, but government institutions do make an effort to monitor
investor compliance in some cases. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of these activities is
hampered by weak agreements, human and resource constraints, and the logistical difficulties of
monitoring investments in distant rural areas. The Government of South Sudan is also desperate to
attract sorely needed foreign capital to the country, and officials are often reluctant to take decisive
action in instances of non-compliance.

Process for Lodging Complaints

Aside from lawsuits in statutory courts, there are no clear processes for lodging complaints
regarding investor compliance with safeguards (LSLA 16). People that have complaints against

companies typically leverage their relationships with government officials to seek redress for harm
that is done to them. The process is ambiguous and varies depending on identity of the complainant
and the type of conduct in question.

                          Text Box 12: Non-Inclusive Investment Negotiations
 In 2008, an Emirati company signed a 30-year agreement with the RSS Ministry of Wildlife to manage and develop
 a 1.68 million hectare national park in an area called Boma, in the southeastern portion of Jonglei State (Deng
 2011a). Boma—located in Pibor county—is home to a number of minority groups, including the Murle, Jie and
 Suri, and has experienced high levels of insecurity in the postwar period. In their discussions with community
 leaders, company representatives reportedly promised to deliver a number of benefits to the people residing in the
 area, including “modern” villages, educational and health services, boreholes, roads and three strategically placed
 airstrips. None of these obligations were formalized in a legally binding manner. Profits from the venture were to be
 split between the government (30 percent) and the company (70 percent).

 In 2011, three years after entering into the agreement with the government, the company had not yet provided any
 of the agreed upon benefits to the communities. T he company’s failure to deliver on its promises prompted several
 political leaders from the Murle community—the community that stands to be most directly affected by the
 investment in Boma—to issue a letter to the Ministry of Wildlife and the Office of the President. The August 2009
 letter states that community participation in decision-making with regard to the project “was completely excluded
 and ignored.” According to the letter:

          Al Ain National Wildlife Company has violated article 6(12) which stipulates clearly that local community
          is the primary beneficiaries of employment opportunities. The company has appointed [a] manager who is
          not son of the Murle community based in Juba. This appointment is completely rejected and the Murle
          community will not tolerate it. The community has capable and qualified people who can fill this post. The
          Ain Company must take it seriously, putting this into effect; removing the so called manager that has been
          imposed on us through political motives, and should appoint the Murle community’s son fill this post so as
          to create a healthy working atmosphere with the local community.

 The letter proposes a number of changes to the investment agreement to align it with community interests. For
 example, the letter proposes that the revenue sharing provision of the agreement be adjusted to include a 10 percent
 share for the local community. The letter also asks for the project period to be reduced from 30 to 20 years, and for
 more specific details concerning the company’s obligation s to provide health, education, and water services to the
 local community. As of December 2011, the government had not responded to the community’s letter.



3.7 Forestry
The Forestry theme assesses various issues relating to forest governance. It covers six indicators
that are assessed using 12 dimensions. The first indicator (FGI-1) examines South Sudan’s
commitment to sustainability and climate change mitigation. The second indicator (FGI-2) looks at
the public goods aspects of forests and the degree to which governance institutions promote their
sustainable use. The third indicator (FGI-3) focuses on South Sudan’s support to private sector
initiatives to invest sustainably in forest activities. The fourth indicator (FGI-4) addresses the
livelihood aspects of forest-dependent communities. The fifth indicator (FGI-5) assesses land use,
tenure and land conversion in forests. The sixth indicator (FGI-6) examines illegal logging and
other forest crimes.

Initiatives to Promote Responsible Forest Use

As of May 2013, South Sudan has only signed a handful of international covenants, including the
Geneva Convention and the Mine Ban Treaty. As a new state, it has taken some time for the
Government to determine the appropriate procedures for undertaking these international
obligations. However, South Sudan is further along the path towards ratification for international
covenants relating to forest conservation and climate change than it is for other international
treaties, such as those relating to human rights (see FGI-1, Dim. i). On January 12, 2012, for
example, South Sudan acceded to the Vienna Convention on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Level (UNEP 2012). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reportedly sent out letters of accession to
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Ramsar Convention, the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD), and South Sudan is now recognized as an observer state to the UNFCCC (2013). South
Sudan is also a member of the UN-REDD Programme, a collaboration between RSS Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development, FAO, UNDP and UNEP.

Representatives of the Ministry of Justice give two main reasons for why the government has been
slow to sign on to international agreements. First, officials are uncertain of the cost implications of
these international obligations. This is a particular concern due to the on-going period of austerity
prompted by the shutdown of oil production in January 2012. The second reason concerns a lack of
clarity regarding the appropriate procedures for signing, ratifying and domesticating international
covenants. South Sudanese law does not clearly state whether South Sudan is a monist state or a
dualist state; in other words, whether international treaties become justiciable in South Sudan upon
signature and ratification or whether they must first be domesticated through legislation passed by
the National Legislative Assembly.

The 2013 Forest Policy states that the government will make a “sustained commitment to regional
and international forest-related agreements and conventions.” The Policy also states that the
government will explore bilateral and regional arrangements for knowledge and skill sharing with
neighboring countries. The Policy identifies the RSS and State governments as having primary
responsibility for implementing international agreements, and a proposed South Sudan Forest
Commission (SSFC) would play a role in coordinating with relevant authorities in the development
and implementation of policies, regulations, and practices. It will take some time, however, for the
government to build capacity in these areas and for the benefits to become apparent. Without
qualified personnel at its disposal, the government is forced to rely on expensive assistance from
foreign experts.

 Kagelu, Central Equatoria. Planting activity intensified in the 1940s, across the Equatorias and Bahr el Ghazal. In
 2004, thirteen teak plantations were found and mapped by satellite, and in 2007, a further five plantations, covering
 a total of 7,680 hectares (76.8 km2), were found with different satellite technology. Most of the mature trees
 standing today are between 35 and 50 years old.

Deforestation and Loss of Biodiversity

Prior to the outbreak of civil war in 1983, South Sudan had an abundance of both natural forests and
plantations. It was estimated that South Sudan had plantations covering 1,879 square kilometers
prior to the war. Natural forests and woodlands are thought to cover approximately 191,667 square
kilometers, or 29 percent of South Sudan’s total land area. During the war, however, the resource
base was severely degraded as a result of wild fires, overgrazing and overcutting. The impact was
particularly felt in government-owned teak plantations. According to Abdalla Gafaar (2011):

            The plantations in Central Equatoria are currently in a degraded state with most of the best quality teak logs
            removed by concessionaires. Most of the plantations in Bahr el Ghazal are in a similar condition. The best
            option for those degraded plantations is to clearfell and regenerate. The plantations in Western Equatoria are
            generally fully stocked but due to lack of thinning they are slow growing and relatively small in size, but they
            are of good quality due to the slow growth rate.

An estimated 45 percent of forest cover in South Sudan and a large proportion of its biodiversity
was lost during the 22-year conflict. According to the International Centre for Research in Agro-

                                                             78

Forestry (ICRAF), between 1973 and 2006, South Sudan lost an average of two percent of its
forests to deforestation every year. If this trend were to continue, it could lead to a near total loss of
forest cover within 50 years. The 2013 Forest Policy highlights deforestation as a central concern
(see FGI-2, Dim. ii):

      [T]here are no sustained afforestation and reforestation programmes to offset accelerating deforestation. The
      budgets allocated for forestry activities at the RSS and State Government levels fall far short of actual
      requirements. …Unless the country reforms its forestry sector, the future is bleak for its wood and non -wood
      forest products.

High rates of deforestation have continued in the postwar period. People cut trees for charcoal
production or to use as construction material. Forest fires are used to prepare land for shifting
cultivation or to rejuvenate grazing areas and can burn uncontrollably. Rapid urban growth and the
influx of returnees are putting additional pressure on forest resources. Demand for wood for the
purposes of industrialization is expected to grow, and the production base is already below demand
levels. The 2013 Forest Policy acknowledges that government regulation has not kept pace with the
changes that the country has experienced in recent years:

       Several policies and regulations involving biodiversity conservation have not been promulgated, so authorities
       with jurisdiction to manage and protect biodiversity lack the legal framework to prosecute illegal activities.
       Moreover, the existing legislation no longer reflects the current reality in South Sudan. The policies and
       legislation that do exist adopt a command-and-control approach with little reliance on civil society as partners
       in conservation.

Despite the Ministry’s concerns, budget allocations for forestry are small compared to those for
agriculture, and the budget for the RSS Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is also smaller than
that of other ministries. Government austerity policies in the wake of the January 2012 shutdown of
oil production have introduced further constraints. In April 2013, the RSS Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning issued a Planning and Budget Call Circular for 2013-14 to provide guidance for
government institutions in developing their annual budgets. The Circular sets the budget ceiling for
the RSS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development at roughly $34
million USD, compared to $71 million USD for the Ministry of Wildlife Conservation and Tourism
and $903 million USD for the Ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs.

In addition to financial constraints, the government must also cope with human resource constraints.
Generally speaking, there is more forestry expertise in South Sudan than in many other sectors. This
is, in part, because South Sudan has a relatively large supply of valuable trees, such as teak,
mahogany, and ebony, which have been sources of revenue for various groups in South Sudan for
many generations.

Public Goods Aspects of Forests

The public goods aspects of forests—including the benefits they provide in terms of biodiversity,
soil and water conservation, and social and cultural values—are recognized in the Forest Policy as
well as under customary law. Protection of these public goods, however, is lacking. The Forest
Policy has not yet been formally adopted and will not begin to have a tangible impact on the forest
sector until the Forest Act is passed. Customary legal systems have been undermined by decades of
conflict and struggle to cope with the challenges facing the country in the postwar context,
including rapid urban development, large returnee and refugee populations, and an influx of foreign
and domestic investors. The existing legal protections are insufficient to protect the public goods
aspects of forests (FGI-2, Dim. ii).

              and productive rural employment

SME Opportunities in South Sudan’s Forests

The RSS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development encourages small-
and medium-enterprises (SMEs) as a way to promote income generation and rural development.
Forest-based industries, including saw mills, furniture, and construction materials, provide
significant sources of off-farm employment for rural South Sudanese. The Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry also encourages private companies investing in timber production to support local
SMEs. The importance of forests in this regard were recognized by President Salva Kiir Mayardiit
in his 2006 opening address to the first National Assembly, in which he said, “Improved agriculture
and forestry services shall become a driving force for our national socio-economic development.
We shall work to improve the rural South Sudan without compromising the sustainability of its
natural resources for future generations.”

The 2013 Forest Policy requires the RSS and State Governments to “promote and support
community forestry and agroforestry to help communities achieve rapid and sustainable socio-
economic development.” According to the Policy:

            Under the previous government-controlled management system, communities gained few direct benefits from
            forests besides employment. This policy introduces a radical shift in promoting active community participation
            in forest management using formal collaborative forest management (CFM) schemes throughout [South]
            Sudan.

SMEs are also emphasized in pilot community forestry projects that are being implemented in
several locations in South Sudan. It is expected that communities in the project areas will generate
commodities from forest resources, such as charcoal, carpentry, and non-timber forest products.

Despite these positive policy statements and strong rhetorical commitment from the government,
translating the rhetoric into tangible benefits for rural communities is still lacking. Table 42 lists
additional opportunities for SMEs:

                       migrants are currently known to buy honey locally in South Sudan and bring it to neighboring
                       countries to process it and package it for commercial sale. If these value-added activities were
                       done in South Sudan, it could help to better capture benefits for South Sudanese communities. No

                    certification or chain-of-custody programs are currently being used in this sector.
 Charcoal           Fuelwood and charcoal comprise approximately 80 percent of the South Sudan’s energy supply
                    and provide an attractive economic opportunity to rural populations throughout the country. There
                    is also a growing demand of fuelwood for brickmaking. No certification or chain-of-custody
                    programs have been documented in this sector.
 Gum Africa         In 2008, according to the Forest Policy, South Sudan was the fourth largest producer of gum
 (a.k.a. Gum        Africa in the world after Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria. Eight of the ten states in South Sudan can
 Arabic)            produce gum Africa. However, most residents of rural areas in South Sudan are unaware of its
                    economic potential and unable to access international markets where the product is commonly
                    traded. In the absence of organized action by South Sudanese producers, Sudanese are purchasing
                    gum Africa in South Sudan and selling it across the border as an export product of Sudan.
 Shea butter        Although shea butter is in high demand worldwide, only about 0.2 percent of South Sudan’s total
                    sheanut production is currently being exported. Most shea production is consumed in domestic
                    markets. There are no certification or chain-of-custody programs for shea butter, but the Ministry
                    of Agriculture and Forestry provides some limited support to small producers in Western
                    Equatoria, Western Bahr-el-Ghazal and Lakes States.


Forest Certification and Chain-of-Custody Programs

Regarding forest certification and chain-of-custody programs, the RSS Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural Development is supportive of private sector efforts to sign on to
such programs, but the process has not yet formalized (see FGI-1, Dim. ii). Aside from a few
isolated examples, commercial producers of wood and non-wood forest products do not participate
in certification or chain-of-custody programs. Were the government to promote the use of these
programs more widely, it could help to lower costs associated with the programs and make them
more accessible to private sector actors. Certification could also attract additional capital, as many
investors are wary of investing in timber production in post-conflict settings and certification
programs would provide them with some assurances that the companies they invest in are meeting
some minimum standards for conflict sensitivity.

Ownership of Forests

According to officials at the RSS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and Rural
Development, prior to the CPA, the ownership and management of forest resources in South Sudan
was clearly defined. The central government in Khartoum owned all of the National Forest
Reserves (NFRs) and the provincial governments owned all of the Provincial Forest Reserves

                                                          81
                                                                                                                DRAFT
(PFRs). The establishment of the autonomous Government of Southern Sudan in 2005, however,
introduced a degree of uncertainty into the legislative framework. Initially, the regional Government
said it would enforce all the preexisting national laws in postwar South Sudan. This caused a
backlash, because most South Sudanese considered the national laws, particularly those relating to
state ownership over unregistered lands, to be oppressive and unjust.

To clarify the Government’s position on the matter, the Ministry of Legal Affairs and Constitutional
Development issued an opinion letter in August 2006 stating that national land laws such as the
Unregistered Land Act would no longer be applicable in the South. However, the 2007 Framework
Forest Policy maintained that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry would continue to apply the
Forests Act of 1989. For the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, recognition of the Forestry Act
was seen as means of asserting government ownership and control over the preexisting reserves.
According to the 2007 Policy:

        The net effect of this lack of control and responsibility [during the war] is that NFR [the same as CFRs] and
        other public forests have been under the siege of claims from various stakeholders —local communities, State
        Government and others. Since the establishment of the GoSS, the MAF took drastic measures to put on hold
        any claims of ownership and to stop illegal activities in all forests. Through this policy, GoSS is restoring a
        common understanding on responsibility and ownership of NFR and other forests on public or communal lands
        such as PFR that should revert to the States. This policy is based on the spirit that GoSS will henceforth take
        responsibility for all existing NFR in Southern Sudan and for others to be gazetted in the future.

While the recognition of the Forests Act of 1989 helped the Government of Southern Sudan to
buttress its claims to NFRs, it also raised certain ambiguities in relation to non-gazzetted forests.
The 1989 Forest Act considers all “waste, forest and unoccupied land” to be at the disposal of the
government. This conflicts with the terms of the 2009 Land Act, which states that community lands
shall include “land lawfully held, managed or used by specific community as community forests,
cultivation, grazing areas, shrines and any other purposes recognized by Law.” The ambiguity in
law and policy relating to non-reserved forests is identified as a cause of concern in the 2013 Forest
Policy:

        The ongoing development of a new land policy and law creates uncertainty around forest and land ownership;
        hence this will cause serious limitation to any investment in forestry development. Land reforms are
        particularly critical to forest sector development strategies and plans. In some cases, like the planned large-
        scale forest land concessions, land reform becomes a prerequisite. The effect of the ambiguity regarding the
        current policy and legal framework governing land is that NFRs and other public forests have been under siege
        of claims by various stakeholders.

Despite these on-going efforts to clarify the matter, ownership over forests has become contentious
in the post-CPA period. Due in part to provisions in the CPA, Interim Constitution, and Transitional
Constitution that afford legal recognition to customary land rights, state governments and rural
communities are demanding that they be consulted and share in the benefits of the natural resources
in their areas, even if those resources are the property of the national government. In claiming their
share of benefits, communities often engage in uncontrolled cutting of natural and plantation forests
for sale of charcoal, poles and timber.

                       Text Box 14: Costs of Timber Production in South Sudan
 As this policy statement acknowledges, timber production is a costly endeavor in South Sudan. The 2013 Forest
 Policy estimates that timber-related taxes, fees, and transport costs constitute 71 percent of the total costs of
 production and processing of timber, and teak in particular. Poor transport infrastructure, the difficulty of accessing
 international markets, degraded and obsolete machinery, a shortage of skilled labor, and the prevalence of
 landmines in many forests introduce additional costs.


Benefit Sharing Associated with Forest Plantations

Although a handful of companies have been exporting teak for several years, teak production in
South Sudan has not yet fully taken root. According to statistics quoted in the Forest Policy,
conservative estimates put the amount of teak that has been exported annually in South Sudan in
recent years at less than 2,500 cubic meters. Teak typically sells for $300 to $400 USD on
international markets and it has been estimated that if the teak plantations reach full production,
they could generate over US $100 million per year in revenue.

The RSS MAF views public-private partnerships to be a key driver of growth in the forest sector.
The 2013 Forest Policy states that, “Investment will be promoted through fair, transparent,
equitable, and legally secure long-term planting and harvesting concessions in public and
community lands.” The primary business sectors for this investment are plantation forestry and
ecotourism. According to the Policy:

        RSS will work with State Governments to operate a system of land concessions for plantation development,
        based on long-term land lease agreements to be negotiated at national, state and county levels. This system will
        be fully transparent and it will ensure that the Governments receive the proper royalties for timber extracted
        while also making sure that the returns to investors are fair and equitable, given the level of investment, the
        anticipated returns and the risks borne.

Among the more contentious issues in plantation forestry relate to revenue sharing. The Transitional
Constitution requires, “National wealth [to be] equitably shared among all levels of government for
the welfare of the people,” and “all states, localities and communities are entitled to equitable
development without discrimination.” Annex II to the 2013 Forest Policy states how royalties from
forest products will be shared among the different levels of government. It states:

  (a)    Revenues from National Forest Reserves (NFRs)

         (i)     RSS will collect all revenues from NFRs
         (ii)    70% of the revenue will go to the RSS Treasury.
         (iii)   20% will go to the respective State Government Treasury.
         (iv)    10% will go to the National Forest Fund

  (b)    Revenues from State Forest Reserves (SFRs)

         (i)     State Governments will collect all revenues from SFRs
         (ii)    60% of revenue will go to the State Government Treasury.
         (iii)   30% will go to the RSS Treasury.
         (iv)    10% will go to the National Forest Fund.

  (c)    Revenues from County Forest Reserves (CFRs)

         (i)     County councils will colleact all revenues from CFRs.
         (ii)    70% of the revenue will go to the County Treasury.
         (iii)   20% will go to the State Government Treasury.
         (iv)    10% to the National Forest Fund.

  (d)    Revenues from community forests

         (i)     Boma and Payam administration will collect revenues from community forests as may apply.
         (ii)    60% of revenue will support community development projects.
         (iii)   30% will support Payam and Boma development projects.
         (iv)    10% will go to the National Forest Fund.

  (e)    Revenue from other natural forest and woodlands

         (i)     The State Governments, County Councils, and Payams are to collect royalties from forest products
                 such as building poles, fuel wood, bamboos, grass, dahashi food, and non-wood forest products.

                Royalty rates will be uniform in all the states and will be determined by RSS as provided for in the
                Forest Act and implementing regulations.
         (ii)   40% of revenue collective will be retained by the State Government. 40% of revenue collected will go
                to the County Council/Payam. 20% of revenue collected will to to the National Forest Fund to support
                national efforts in afforestation, environmental rehabilitation, technical support, and training.
  …

  (h)    Supervision fees for private plantations and woodlots

         (i)    At the time of harvesting private plantations and woodlots in all public holdings (gazetted forest
                lands), 2.5% of the value will be remitted to State Government treasury and another 2.5% will be
                remitted to RSS treasury. This will cover technical supervision and oversight charges.
         (ii)   At the time of harvesting private plantations and woodlots in all public lands, 1% of total value will be
                remitted to the National Forest Fund.

Private sector investments also include revenue sharing arrangements. For example, several teak
plantations in Western Equatoria provide a lump sum payment, typically in the range of US
$100,000 to $200,000, for affected communities. Communities are also provided with US $5 for
every cubic meter of teak that is exported. Employment opportunities provide another source of
potential benefits for communities and companies alike. According to Aly Verjee, as of January
2013, the Equatoria Teak Company, one of several companies investing in teak production in
Western Equatoria, employed about 150 workers in the Nzara area, and anticipated that figure
would rise to 200 by the second quarter of 2013. In 2009, he says Equatoria Teak employed 246
staff.

In addition to formal benefit sharing arrangements, there are also additional informal fees that are
often demanded by communities living on and around government forest reserves. In Eastern
Equatoria, for example, communities often ask for a percentage of the timber being harvested,
sometimes up to 10 percent or higher, in cash or in kind. Although these are technically government
forest reserves, communities often feel that the forests belong to the communities and they enjoy
rights to the reserves as well. They often make these demands of anyone seeking to harvest timber,
government representatives included. The revenue is typically paid to a local chief, youth group, or
local government official. However, there is little transparent accounting in the project and it is
likely that some of the revenue accrues to self-interested individuals.

Regarding benefit sharing within communities, the 2013 Forest Policy observes that women often
enjoy less benefits than men due to restrictions on their access to and use of forest resources.
Women have limited property rights compared to those of men and also enjoy fewer employment
opportunities in the collection, production and sale of timber, wood, charcoal, and other forest
products. The Policy cites this as a contributor to rising poverty rates among women.

                   Text Box 15: South Sudanese Teak on International Markets
 A planned export ban on unfinished teak logs from Myanmar from April 2014 will likely push up world prices and
 possibly intensify demand for South Sudanese teak. In January 2013, Equatoria Teak Company (ETC), a private
 company that has been investing in teak production in South Sudan since 2007, estimated that the processed timber
 would sell for $750-$1500/m3 on international markets. A 2007 study by the United Nations Environmental
 Programme (UNEP) estimates that teak exports could produce $50 million USD per year.

Boundary Demarcation

The boundaries of forest reserves in South Sudan are poorly demarcated. During the war and into
the postwar period, people encroached onto forest reserves seeking refuge from conflict or for
easier access to forest resources. In some places, unplanned urban growth has transformed forests in
and around urban centers into residential settlements.

There are currently plans in place to survey and demarcate all the natural forests, timber plantations,
and forest reserves in South Sudan. The RSS Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry started the
process shortly after the signing of the CPA. An INGO called the Norwegian Forestry Group (NFG)
assisted the Ministry in its efforts to assess the resource value of South Sudan’s teak reserves and to
demarcate the boundaries of the teak plantations. According to the Forest Policy:

            RSS [the national government] will take ownership of all previous Central Forest Reserves (CFRs) and will
            ensure their effective management and protection as National Forest Reserves (NFRs). In addition, the RSS
            ministry responsible for forests will delineate and gazette other forests as NFRs toward achievement of the
            country’s development goal of 20% of land area being covered by forests.

The policy calls for the creation of a South Sudan Forest Commission (SSFC) to be responsible for
compiling and updating information on all forest reserves to inform forest management planning
and revenue sharing. The RSS Minister responsible for forests would be the only actor with
authority to make any changes in boundaries of NFRs and protection forests. All changes would
require the approval of the National Legislative Assembly. Changes to State Forest Reserves
(SFRs), County Forest Reserves (CFRs), and Community Forests would have to be approved by the
RSS Minister as well.

                                                             knowledgeable about the effects of forest
                                                             offences.

Forest Crimes and Corruption

There is rampant unlawful entry into forests in South Sudan. Efforts to investigate and prosecute
people who are involved with illegal logging activities are difficult. Perpetrators are often armed
and sometimes forest guards themselves are implicated in the crimes. Although the Penal Code
includes a number of provisions that could be applied to forest crimes, judges rarely punish timber
smugglers and poachers to the full extent of the law. The forestry department also lacks the
financial and human resources to monitor the forests in any meaningful way.

In addition, there is a lack of clarity over who has responsibility for policing the forests, both in
terms of horizontal and vertical federalism. Forest departments are established in most counties
where there are significant timber resources. However, they report mainly to the county and state
levels; rarely do they report to the national level. As a result, it is difficult to determine the status of
all of the forests from a single location. There is also poor communication among the many
concerned institutions, including the RSS Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, RSS Ministry of
Wildlife, and RSS Ministry of Water and Irrigation.

Sometimes disputes over illegal logging are solved at the local level without the formal involvement
of the justice system. People who illegally cut trees may be held in detention for several days before
being released without legal proceedings. There is no record of anyone ever being sentenced to a
criminal sanction for forest-related crimes.

There are also very serious problems of poaching in forests. An executive order banning poaching
activities was issued shortly after the signing of the CPA, but it is not being consistently enforced.
For the most part, people engage in poaching activities for bush meat, which is sold in regional
centers throughout South Sudan. However, there have also been documented cases of killing
animals for other animal products, such as elephant ivory and rhino horn.

On the issue of corruption, little hard data is currently available, but the issue is acknowledged as a
concern by most government institutions involved with forestry. In some cases, forest guards are
known to have colluded with people who come to illegally cut timber. In one case, according to a
report by the Oakland Institute, the manager of a concession in Central Equatoria called police to
apprehend a number of security sector personnel who were illegally harvesting teak from the
company’s concession. Rather than arresting the perpetrators, however, the police instead arrested
the manager. He was held in detention for several days before being released, at which point he left
the country.

Concluding Remarks and Policy Options
Land governance institutions in South Sudan are struggling to cope with the many challenges of the
post-conflict period. Increasing land values, skyrocketing demand, economic development,
urbanization, population growth, and the development of administrative units have contributed to
the growing complexity of land issues. For South Sudan to transition from a country that is heavily
dependent on humanitarian aid and foreign assistance to one that is development-oriented and self-
sufficient, the Government of South Sudan must invest time and effort into developing institutions
of land governance that are suited to modern realities.

Since it was established in 2005, the South Sudan Land Commission (SSLC) has provided
leadership on land issues, but as an independent commission without representation in the Council
of Ministers, the SSLC does not have the mandate to execute the reforms called for in the Land Act.
To address this gap, the 2013 Land Policy proposed the creation of a new position of Deputy
Minister of Lands in the RSS Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. The Deputy Minister
would be responsible for promoting the reforms called for in the Land Act and fostering greater
coherence among land governance institutions at all levels. One of the early tasks of the new
Deputy Minister of Lands will be to develop a roadmap for tackling challenges in the land sector,
including a list of priorities and a timeframe for different activities. It is hoped that this study may
provide some useful insights in this regard.

The following policy options are meant to inform the Government of South Sudan’s efforts to build
rule of law and good governance in the land sector:

On Legislative and Regulatory Reforms

The legislative reforms called for in the 2013 Draft Land Policy present an entry-point for a variety
of initiatives in the land sector. Legislative reforms provide achievable, medium-term goals that can
help focus efforts on particular issues of interest. Among the major pieces of legislation called for in
the Land Policy are a Community Land Act, Land Registration Act and Town and Country
Planning Act. In order to prepare South Sudan for the larger-scale interventions that are required to
implement legislation, proposed reforms should incorporate detailed timelines, estimated costs and
institutional responsibilities to ensure timely implementation. Indicators should also be identified
and regularly reported on to monitor progress towards policy goals. Additional policy options on
legislative and regulatory reforms could include the following:

      Harmonizing Legislation and Implementing the Land Policy: To proceed with the
       reforms called for in the Land Policy, the government should begin by identifying the gaps
       in current legislation and the areas where the existing laws are inconsistent with one another
       and with the Transitional Constitution. The institutional framework for land governance at
       the local government level must be harmonized between the Land Act and the Local
       Government Act. The Government must also clarify the definition of community land and
       public land in the Transitional Constitution and the Land Act.

      Registration of Community Lands: Whereas in the past, unwritten customary land
       systems may have been able to manage most of the land issues that arise in rural areas, new
       land uses in the post-war period, including land acquisitions for the purposes urban
       expansion, private investment or use by the military, are putting added pressures on
       community lands. The registration of community land rights could help to protect
       landholding communities from having their lands alienated without their consent. The RSS
       Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning could design the process in consultation
       with the SSLC, the state-level Ministries of Physical Infrastructure and Local Governments.
                                                  87
                                                                                           DRAFT
    The process could then be formalized in a Community Land Act and a Land Registration
    Act. The Government should also incorporate a dispute resolution mechanism into the
    process to manage disputes that may arise between neighboring communities and within
    communities themselves.

   Legal Recognition of Land Rights in Informal Settlements: In its legislative reforms, the
    Government should clarify the rights of individuals and groups residing in informal
    settlements. If the Land Act’s provision recognizing the land rights of people who have
    resided on unregistered land for 30 years or more is to be maintained, it should be applied
    consistently. For those who have not resided in an area for that length of time, the law
    should clearly stipulate who’s rights will be recognized.

   Roadmap for Implementing Policy Changes: The RSS Ministry of Lands, in consultation
    with the SSLC, should develop a roadmap for implementation of the 2013 Land Policy. This
    roadmap should take into account the existing human and financial resources of the
    institutions and the length of time that would be required for different interventions.

   Addressing Disputes Among Government Institutions: Resolving the internal disputes
    that arise between the three levels of government will be an integral component of
    institutional development in the land sector. The new Deputy Minister of Lands can provide
    leadership in overcoming the differences and charting a way forward for government
    institutions. The initial posture of the Deputy Minister should be one of reconciling the
    competing views within government such that she or he is not perceived to be imposing
    national interests on the state and local governments.

   SSLC Legislation: Eight years after it was established by a presidential decree, the SSLC is
    still without legislation detailing its mandate. This legislation should be passed immediately
    and plans should be developed to extend the Land Commission to the state level. The
    legislation should clearly articulate the reporting lines between the state-level Land
    Commissions and the national Land Commission.

   Specialized Policy-Making: The development of law and policy should be geared towards
    increased specialization so as to fully address the unique issues that arise in each area.
    Priority issues and issues that are not addressed in sufficient detail in the existing policy,
    such as women’s land rights, could be the focus of specific policy and legislative initiatives.
    This would go a long way towards addressing the prevailing gaps in law and policy and
    providing institutions with concrete steps that can be taken to address specific issues of
    concern. For example, if the Government has determined that women are facing difficulties
    in obtaining rights to land through the formal registration process, it could provide data to
    substantiate this finding in a stand-alone policy on women’s property rights. To address the
    problem, the policy could require land registries to promote the joint registration of
    landholdings for married couples in the names of both spouses. Other issues of concern to
    women’s property rights could also be detailed in such a policy document.

   Streamlined Policy-Making: Parliamentary approval of the Land Policy and the Forestry
    Policy has helped to ensure broad support for these very important policies. Now that these
    policies have been endorsed, the government should consider empowering the relevant
    government institutions to enact policies unilaterally without requiring parliamentary
    approval. This would help to streamline policy-making and alleviate some of the burden on
    the National Legislative Assembly.

   Simultaneous Development of Policy, Law and Regulation: The new legislation should

                                              88
                                                                                           DRAFT
    be developed simultaneously with policies that detail the challenges confronting the
    government and the government’s plans to address those challenges. Regulations could be
    developed along with the legislation and the policies such that once the law is passed,
    implementation proceeds immediately. This will avoid limit the potential for disagreements
    to arise about whether policy should precede law or whether law can be passed in the
    absence of policy.

   Strategic Implementation of Law and Policy: Where possible, intermediate steps should
    be considered, such as the pilot testing combined with rigorous monitoring and impact
    evaluation of institutional development initiatives in strategic locations, such as is now
    being done with state and local government institutions in Yambio and Bor (see LGI-7).
    Another example of a transitional arrangement could be to assign a land registry in a
    strategically located CLA responsibility for land registration in neighboring counties.

   Reporting on the Implementation of Law and Policy: The RSS Ministry of Lands,
    Housing and Physical Planning and the SSLC should develop a system for periodically
    reporting on the implementation of land-related laws and policies. The system should
    include indicators to help determine progress towards policy goals. For example, the
    implementation of policies relating to women’s property rights in urban areas could track
    how much land is registered in the name of women and monitor any changes that occur over
    time.

   Restatements of Customary Law: In order to clarify the rules and practices of customary
    land tenure regimes, the government could develop restatements of the customary laws of
    different communities. The goal of the restatements would be to provide some clarity about
    the rules that apply to different areas of community land and to facilitate the formalization
    of customary land tenure. Restatements should be clearly distinguished from codification.
    Experience in other African countries has shown that codification of customary law
    ‘freezes’ it in time and negates the advantages that living customary law has in terms of
    flexibility and ability to change. As practice outpaces the codified law, the latter loses
    legitimacy in the eyes of the people and they stop following the outdated rules.
    Restatements, on the other hand, do not need to pass through the legislative process and can
    be easily amended to reflect changing norms. Furthermore, since they are merely persuasive
    authority and not legally binding per se, they can assist institutions in determining prevailing
    norms without superseding the customary law as applied by people in their day-to-day lives.

   Legal Personality for Communities: Establishing a process for formally recognizing the
    legal personality of landholding communities would provide communities with a means of
    representing themselves (e.g. the ability to sue or be sued, enter into contracts, etc.) and
    designating their legally authorized representatives.

   Clarifying Freehold Tenure: The RSS Ministry of Lands and the SSLC must decide
    whether freehold is indeed a tenure type that is available in South Sudan and if so, how to
    operationalize it. In order to allow time for property rights to stabilize, the government could
    consider introducing a ‘delayed freehold’ concept, in which long-term leasehold rights are
    granted that would convert into freehold at some future date.

   Condominium Regime: Consider adding a condominium regime to the draft Housing
    Policy and any legislation that flows from it.

   Coherence with the Constitutional Development Process: Any legal reforms undertaken
    now could be made redundant by changes in the permanent constitution. Policy-makers

                                              89
                                                                                            DRAFT
       should therefore coordinate activities with the National Constitutional Review Commission
       (NCRC) to minimize the potential for inconsistencies between legislative reforms and the
       permanent constitution.

On Women’s Property Rights

Women’s property rights are on the top of the agenda for development actors in South Sudan, but
insufficient attention is paid to women’s rights in the development of policies and laws. As a first
step, the Ministry of Lands, in consultation with the Ministry of Gender, could develop a more
detailed policy framework pertaining to women’s property rights. The policy should explain the
challenges that women face in South Sudan in retaining property after divorce, the death of their
spouse, market transfers and through government distribution schemes. Such a policy could be
developed in tandem with legislation that provides detailed mechanisms to give meaning to the
rights enshrined in the Transitional Constitution and the Land Act. The legislation could provide a
statutory alternative to marriages under customary law and detail minimum standards for how
women’s property rights may be treated in customary law marriages. Other policy options include
the following:

      Mandatory Registration of Married Parties: In order to increase the percentage of women
       with registered rights to land, the government could consider mandatory registration of all
       married parties (including polygamous unions) in the formalization process. This would
       allow for property to automatically pass to men’s wives upon their death, bypassing the
       probate process.

      Awareness Raising: Legal empowerment efforts should be designed to educate people
       about the benefits of improving security of tenure for women and how women and girls may
       assert their rights under existing laws.

      Affirmative Action: In line with national quotas for women’s participation in governance,
       government institutions in the land sector should be encouraged to adopt affirmative action
       initiatives to address gender imbalances in their staffing.

      Civic Education: The SSLC, RSS Ministry of Lands, and state-level Ministries of Physical
       Infrastructure could develop guidelines to explain basic principles of land rights. These
       guidelines could be used to inform people about their rights and to raise awareness about
       new reforms.

      Highlighting Good Practice: Attention should be focused on identifying examples of good
       practice in how South Sudanese are approaching women’s property rights issues. By
       highlighting local innovations, policy-makers can identify practices that can be scaled-up
       and incorporated into programming activities in other locations. A similar approach could be
       used in other areas, such as issues relating to the large-scale acquisition of land rights,
       dispute resolution or tenure formalization.

On Improving Transparency

Transparency is an indispensible element of good governance. Without information about
government activities, people may misinterpret problems that arise from circumstances that are no
one’s fault as indicative of corruption or incompetence.

          Information Dissemination: All governmental and non-governmental projects that compile
           land information should devote sufficient resources to publicizing the information that is
           compiled and making it available to the public.

          Information Sharing within Government: The government must develop a better system
           for sharing information on land acquisitions among the levels of government and across
           sectors to ensure that areas are not designated for contradictory uses. As the lead institution
           mandated with addressing land issues in the 2013 Land Policy, the RSS Ministry of Housing
           and Physical Planning should take the lead in developing and monitoring this system. The
           process will also require close coordination between the state-level Ministries of Physical
           Infrastructure and the RSS Ministry of Housing.

          Land Records: Government institutions should be supported to develop systems of record
           keeping such that it is easier to identify what information exists and to organize data
           retrieval. Developing online presences for government institutions could be a good starting
           place and would help to dramatically improve access to information for practitioners.

          Institutional Responsibility for Information Sharing: The National Bureau of Statistics
           or the Ministry of Information could play a role in ensuring access to public information by
           developing information sharing systems and gathering important documents from
           government institutions and storing them in a public library or other central location.

          Right to Access Information: The government should strengthen legal provisions
           recognizing the right of citizens to access information about public landholdings as a matter
           of public interest. Mechanisms for people to access information could be detailed in the
           forthcoming Right to Access Information Act or accompanying regulations. To facilitate the
           process, land information could be maintained at a central location and available for public
           review. The government should take advantage of modern information management
           technologies to facilitate information sharing within government and with members of the
           public.

          Parliamentary Review of Land Acquisitions: Mandatory parliamentary review for public
           land allocations above a certain size can also help to improve transparency for land
           transfers. Requirements for parliamentary approval can be stipulated in the Land Acquisition
           Act proposed in the 2013 Land Policy.

On Developing the Land Registry

Land registries in South Sudan require urgent attention to limit potentials for self-interested
dealings and corruption. A plan should be designed to modernize information management systems
in the land registries, correct inaccurate and fraudulent information, promote greater transparency,
and establish a national land register. As a first step, the RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and
Physical Planning should work to build the necessary political will to implement reforms through
direct engagement with state-level Ministries of Physical Infrastructure and State Secretariats. The
reform of land registries can begin with pilot projects in preselected locations in which existing
information in the registries is checked against bona fide landholders on the ground. The pilot
projects can then inform efforts to upscale the exercise to cover registered lands in urban areas
throughout the country. Other initiatives that can help to strengthen the registry include:

           Assessment of Existing Land Information Systems: Assess the systems and procedures
            currently being used in managing the land registry. Developed detailed plans, including
            timelines and cost estimates, for incorporating modern information technology. Plans

                                                     91
                                                                                           DRAFT
    should be accompanied by a needs assessment of registry staff to determine what would be
    required to operate a computerized land registry. The assessment should also examine why
    the administrative changes in the assignment of responsibility for the land registry (i.e.
    moving the registry from the Judiciary to the Ministry of Housing) called for in the Land
    Act have not been implemented and lay out a roadmap and timeline for how to implement
    the changes.

   Establishing a National Land Registry and Decentralized Registries: Establish a
    national land registry in the RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning. While
    most registration activities would still take place at the state and local level, the national
    registry would link with registries at the lower levels of government and provide a
    comprehensive listing of landowners in South Sudan in a single location. The
    establishment of a national level land registry must be approached carefully to avoid
    recognizing any inaccurate or illegitimate land claims that may currently be present in the
    state land registries. The RSS Ministry of Lands could begin with pilot registration
    processes that target specific urban areas. Staff could cross-check data in the state registries
    with information drawn from field visits and interviews with landholders. The process
    could incorporate a dispute resolution component to provide a first instance adjudication of
    any disputes that arise in the course of registration. The bona fide landholders and any
    relevant encumbrances or restrictions could then be entered into a computerized registry
    based in the RSS Ministry of Lands. Once the system has been fine-tuned, the Ministry
    could explore options for expanding the registration process to other urban areas.

   Improving Public Relations: Establish a public relations office in the RSS Ministry of
    Lands, Housing and Physical Planning and the state-level Ministries of Physical
    Infrastructure. The functions of this public relations office could be spelled out in the
    proposed Land Registration Act at the national level to foster some uniformity in how
    states approach the public provision of land information at the state level. The Land
    Registry should also develop and publish service standards detailing how staff are meant to
    relate to the public.

   Information Sharing Within Government: Develop information sharing policies to
    govern how information is shared among government institutions for various purposes. To
    the extent that the land registry is meant to exist at all levels of government, the policies
    should describe how the information will be shared among the various institutions
    involved.

   Developing a Publicly Accessible Schedule of Fees: Increased transparency in the
    process of land registration can help to improve service delivery in land registration. Staff
    administering the process should have a schedule of fees that is publicly accessible which
    lays out all fees that are required for registering a parcel of land.

   Awareness Raising and Civic Education: The institutions involved could also engage in
    simple awareness raising activities, such as the development of brochures that explain the
    process, posting information about the process outside the respective offices, or providing
    official information about the land registration process online, in order to educate people
    about the process. A more intensive civic education process could include personnel
    stationed at the various departments of the land registry whose sole task is to answer
    people’s questions about the process and point them towards the appropriate offices.

   Reducing Cost in the Registration Process: The Government should explore mechanisms
    for reducing the cost of the registration process and to make it available to a larger segment

                                              92
                                                                                              DRAFT
        of the population. It should also reexamine its policies on arrear payments for expired
        leases to ensure that people are not priced out of renewing their expired leases.

On Land Use Planning, Management and Taxation

Land use planning processes are severely underdeveloped in South Sudan. The development of the
Town and Country Planning Act called for the 2013 Land Policy can help to galvanize efforts in
this regard, but a first step would be to take stock of all the land use mapping activities that have
taken place. The government and its development partners should make all information associated
with these mapping activities readily available to the public. Other policy options include the
following:

      Assess and Compile Existing Maps: The projects involving land use mapping components
       that are underway in several parts of the country should be assessed in order to determine
       opportunities for up-scaling and strategically extending activities to other areas. For rural
       land matters, peri-urban land would make a good location to focus efforts given the sharp
       increase in demand for land to accommodate urban expansion.

      Town and Country Planning Act: Legislative reforms can help to support urban planning
       processes in South Sudan. The Town and County Planning Act should clarify the
       government’s approach to urban planning at the national, state and local levels. This
       legislation should protect the public’s right to participate in the process and detail processes
       for how public input will be sought and incorporated into urban planning. While developing
       this legislation, the relevant government institutions could also develop a land use planning
       policy to clarify the current state of land use planning, where the problems are occurring,
       and what the reform process will look like.

      Development of a Property Tax System: The RSS Ministry of Finance should coordinate
       its efforts to develop a Local Government Property Tax Act with the other legislative
       reforms called for in the Land Policy, such as the Land Valuation Act. Property tax systems
       should also be designed at the state and national levels. In establishing a property tax
       system, the Ministry should take into consideration the challenges that have been
       encountered with other types of taxes. The level of government with responsibility for tax
       collection should be clearly stipulated to avoid multiple taxation by different levels of
       government.

      Land Valuation: Legislation is required to clarify a mechanism for determining land
       values. This can help to better control the real estate market, determine appropriate
       compensation when expropriation occurs, and develop a functioning property tax system.
       The Land Policy calls for a Land Valuation Act, which could also include information about
       how property taxes would be determined.

      Disseminate Information about Building Permits: The first step in promoting adherence
       to building codes is to disseminate information about the building permit application
       process. Information about the process should be posted at the state-level Ministries of
       Physical Infrastructure. Information brochures and other civic education activities could also
       help to raise awareness about the process.

      Develop Systems for Building Inspections: The Government should allocate resources
       should towards building the capacity of staff in the state-level Ministries of Physical
       Infrastructure to inspect building sites. Inspectors may need to take some security


                                                 93
                                                                                             DRAFT
        precautions, but inspections should not be used as covers to extort money from people that
        have constructed without first obtaining permits.

       Streamline and Modernize the Building Permit System: If the authorities are successful
        at getting more people to construct their dwellings in accordance with building codes, they
        will find it more difficult to process permits in a timely manner. Efforts to streamline and
        modernize the process and computerize the system should start therefore immediately,
        before the demands increase.

       Enforcement of Urban Plot Sizes: The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning
        should draft regulations stipulating plot sizes in consultation with Ministries of Physical
        Infrastructure at the state level. The regulations should establish systems for monitoring the
        actions of surveyors and taking action against the intentional manipulation of plot sizes for
        personal gain.

On the Formalization Process in Urban Areas

In order to foster coherence in the formalization process, there is an urgent need for the government
to clarify its position on the role that landholding communities play in the process. Whether led by
the Government or by landholding communities, formalization procedures must meet minimum
standards of fairness, accountability and accessibility. Additional policy options include the
following:

       Bottom-up Formalization: All formalization efforts should be approached as bottom-up
        processes that require a careful examination of the local context. Every stage of the process
        should be documented using a public process and those documents should be available for
        public review. A similar approach should be used for first-time registration of land rights.

       Legislative Development: The processes through which land is formalized should be
        clarified through a Land Registration Act. In order to develop such legislation, additional
        research must be conducted to better understand how formalization processes function in
        Juba and other urban areas.

       Revisiting Fees: Institutions involved in formalizing landholdings and registering land
        transfers should assess the applicable fees to determine where they might be excessive. Fees
        should simply offset administrative costs and should not be seen as a major source of
        revenue for government institutions.

       Managing Disputes: Develop a grievance management system to address disputes that
        arise in the course of formalization efforts. The process should allow for dispute resolution
        through administrative processes. It should also safeguard people’s right to pursue remedies
        through the judicial system.

       Improved Land Use Planning: Prior to embarking on formalization efforts, the
        government should develop master plans and land use plans in consultation with affected
        populations. These plans should be available for public review. Procedures and institutional
        responsibilities for land use planning should be detailed in the proposed Town and Country
        Planning Act.

       Formalizing Community Lands in Areas Experiencing High Demand: The government
        should extend its formalization efforts to land held under customary land tenure in rural
        areas, with a priority placed on areas that are experiencing high demand, such as peri-urban
                                                 94
                                                                                               DRAFT
        areas and land designated for investment. By formalizing these landholdings, communities
        can help to protect themselves from the encroachment of urban lands. Policy-makers should
        also consider establishing processes for recognizing individual land rights in areas under
        customary land tenure. Any such process require careful designing and a full understanding
        of the underlying customary land tenure system to ensure that the recording of individual
        rights does not undermine the broader customary system.

       Legal Empowerment Activities: In areas where first-time registration is being done for a
        large group of people at once, non-governmental organizations could send paralegals or
        other individuals who are trained in the rules and practices surrounding land allocation and
        registration to inform people about their rights and monitor the process for misconduct.

       Public-Private Partnerships: Examine opportunities for partnerships with private sector
        actors to improve the efficiency of the process.

On Public Land Management

In order to better justify public landownership, the Government of South Sudan should develop
ways of distributing profits of public lands to people residing around public lands. Some efforts are
already underway with the benefit sharing arrangements for teak plantations. These efforts should
be reviewed and plans should be developed for formalizing benefit-sharing arrangements in other
sectors. The government should also review its land management procedures to identify where gaps
arise and where resources should be channeled to promote a more efficient and accountable system.
Additional policy options include the following:

       Public Goods Aspects of Public Lands: In order to create a more direct link between
        public ownership of agricultural schemes, forest reserves, game reserves and national parks,
        a portion of revenue generated from these public projects should be devoted towards
        providing resources and infrastructure development for affected communities. Revenue
        allocation should incorporate transparent and accountable systems of financial management
        and should take into consideration the specific priorities of local populations.

       Land Inventory: The Government should develop a land inventory that clearly lists
        government landholdings and the benefits derived thereof. Developing an official gazette, a
        written version of which could be made available to interested parties upon request could
        provide a basis upon which to develop a more comprehensive land inventory. The
        institutions that oversee different categories of public lands should conduct regular auditing
        of proceeds from those lands. The reports should be made available for public review.

       Catalogue of Maps: The existing maps should be catalogued and assessed to determine the
        extent to which public landholdings as they exist on the ground correspond with the maps.
        Existing maps should digitized and stored in a central institution.

       Modernizing Mapping: The Government should explore possibilities for incorporating
        modern satellite technology or open source mapping software into its mapping efforts.
        These formats could provide alternative options for people who are not able to access the
        official maps.

On Demolitions, Forced Evictions and Compensation




                                                  95
                                                                                            DRAFT
Additional oversight is needed to ensure that people’s rights are respected in the process of urban
rezoning. Development actors should monitor demolitions and forced evictions more closely and
regularly report on the numbers of people affected. Other policy options include the following:

      Monitoring Demolition Activity: Establish a mechanism including government officials,
       representatives of South Sudanese civil society, and international agencies to monitor
       demolition activity and document the numbers of people affected, the manner in which the
       evictions are carried out and the provision of compensation.

      Establishing National Standards: The government should ensure that all demolition
       activity complies with the requirements of the 2011 Transitional Constitution, the 2009
       Land Act, and minimum standards of international law. A first step towards this end would
       be to develop national guidelines for expropriation. These guidelines should be promoted at
       the state and local government level as well.

      Increased Transparency: The Government should also devote attention to strengthening
       transparency and participation in urban planning. This could help to reduce some of the
       confusion and uncertainty associated with expropriations and evictions.

      Regulatory Framework: The implementing regulations for the Land Act should detail the
       process by which people whose land has been expropriated are to be compensated, including
       the process for calculating the value of the expropriated land and the manner in which the
       compensation process is to be monitored.

      Complaint Management System: The government should establish a complaint
       management system to accompany all acts of expropriation. The process should be instituted
       well before any eviction orders are issued and it should be fully publicized among affected
       populations. Peoples’ right to pursue redress through the judicial system should be
       maintained as an option throughout the process.

      Legal Empowerment Programming: Legal empowerment programming could supplement
       the formal complaint mechanisms. Paralegals could be trained and deployed in areas where
       land is being expropriated to help to raise awareness about people’s rights in the process of
       expropriation. Such programming could also help to facilitate people’s access to the justice
       system if they feel as though their rights have been violated.

On Land-based Investment

The slow pace with which land-based investment is materializing in South Sudan offers certain
opportunities for the government to put in place a proper regulatory framework beforehand. Any
such efforts must prioritize the development needs of South Sudanese and take into consideration
the risks that poorly planned investments carry for populations in South Sudan. Policy options
include the following:

      Review of Investment Agreements: In 2011, the president announced that the government
       would undertake a review of land sales during the interim period to determine whether or
       not they complied with existing laws. No such review has taken place. The government
       should fulfill its prior commitment and undertake a review of existing land leases. The
       investigation should be conducted in an open and transparent manner and the findings
       should be published.

      Presumption in Favor of Disclosure: The government should adopt a presumption in favor

                                                96
                                                                                           DRAFT
    of disclosure, meaning that project proponents must make information associated with
    investments publicly available unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.
    Memorandums of understanding (MOUs), investment agreements, contracts, leases and
    environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) would be kept in easily accessible
    locations at the central, state, and local levels and be open to public review. This
    presumption could be included in the proposed Right of Access to Information Bill.

   Empower Landowning Communities: The Community Land Act proposed in the 2013
    Land Policy can help to clarify the ambiguity surrounding the ownership rights of
    communities. If customary land rights are given equal force with freehold and leasehold
    rights, then presumably communities or their legally authorized representatives must be
    primary signatories to any investment agreement on community land. The Community Land
    Act could clarify these rights, support the government’s oversight over the contracting
    process, and lay out clear procedures by which companies could enter into legally binding
    contacts with community landowners.

   Streamlined Procedures: The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment is making
    efforts to streamline procedures for land acquisition, in coordination with the International
    Finance Corporation. Streamlined procedures could help to reduce the unreasonably long
    and uncertain acquisition processes that currently exist. However, safeguards must be
    included in the process to make sure that it does not allow companies to sidestep
    environmental and social protections.

   Parliamentary Approval: To improve transparency and accountability with respect to
    investments, the approval of land-based investments above a certain size should be subject
    to parliamentary oversight.

   Grievance Management: Government policy should encourage companies to put in place
    grievance mechanisms to promote the prompt resolution of disputes at the local level. Any
    such mechanism should be designed in consultation with affected populations and its rules
    and procedures must be well publicized. In order to protect people’s rights to a free trial
    under the 2011 Transitional Constitution and international human rights law, grievance
    mechanisms should not preempt legal redress through the formal justice system.

   Pre-Investment Community Planning: Communities could also develop community
    protocols, or documents that describe community expectations for people who wish to
    implement programs on community land. In addition to information about the form of
    engagement that the community finds acceptable, a community protocol could also list
    different forms of land use restrictions that apply to different areas.

   Improved Contracting: The government should explore methods of improving contracting
    for land-based investments. Possible approaches could include developing model contracts
    to distribute among relevant institutions at the appropriate level of government or capacity-
    building activities for legal advisers in government institutions.

   Clarifying Grounds for Expropriation for Public Interest or Purpose: Government
    policy should clarify what types of investments qualify as a public interest or public purpose
    that would justify an expropriation. The 2012 Mining Act, for example, declares mining to
    be a public interest that would justify expropriation. However, there is less clarity about
    whether the government would consider an agricultural investment to be in the public
    interest.


                                              97
                                                                                              DRAFT
      Corruption: The Anti-Corruption Commission should devote attention to examining
       corruption in relation to land sales.

      Project Monitoring: The proposed Land Acquisition Act could include provisions relating
       to project monitoring, which could be used to improve oversight over investments.
       Contracts should also include specific predefined sanctions for the nonperformance of
       contractual obligations and mechanisms by which these sanctions would be enforced.

      Community Financial Management: Government institutions, companies or third parties,
       such as NGOs or academic institutions, could work with communities in areas where
       investments are planned to develop their capacity with regard to financial management.

      Benefit Sharing: More clear requirements of benefit sharing could be included in the Land
       Acquisition Act, which is called for in the 2013 Land Policy.

      Institutional Development: In developing its institutions of land administration, the
       Government should develop the capacity of the County Land Authorities and Payam Land
       Councils to monitor investment commitments and promote good faith prior consultations
       and negotiations between companies and affected populations.

      Managing Environmental and Social Impacts: To take advantage of local knowledge and
       promote constructive relationships between companies and communities, ESIAs should be
       done in a participatory manner with affected populations. The results should be
       communicated to affected communities and the wider public. Mechanisms should also be
       put in place to monitor impact and mitigation measures and adjust impact mitigation plans
       as needed.

      Moratoriums: Targeted and time-bound moratoriums can also help the Government to
       avoid entering into long-term commitments until the governance institutions have had an
       opportunity to mature.

      Legal Personality for Communities: One way to help facilitate negotiations with investors
       is to establish a legally recognizable entity that has legal personality to enter into contracts
       on behalf of the community. Such institutions already exist in some parts of the country.
       Any such institution must be established with the full participation of people residing in
       rural areas. Standards for developing community organizations or cooperatives should be
       clearly articulated in law and should have a strong foundation in consensus decision-making
       processes.

On Forestry

Plantation forestry provides South Sudan with an accessible source of revenue that can help to
diversify the economy and give other land-based investment sectors time to take root. However, a
focus on plantation forestry to the exclusion of other important issues such as community forest
management and REDD+ initiatives would hamper the future development of the forestry sector.
Policy options include the following:

      Recognition of Traditional Land Rights in Forests: Until a new Forest Act is passed, the
       Government should make clear that the 1989 Forest Act, which deems unregistered forests
       to be state property, does not apply to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Land Act.

      Treaty Ratification: The Government of South Sudan should move ahead with ratifying
       international treaties relating to forest conservation and combating climate change. The RSS
       Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry should also develop detailed plans for implementing its
       commitment to these conventions. The proposed Forestry Commission could take the lead in
       these efforts.

      Mapping: The Ministry should develop a timeline and associated costs for up-scaling its
       mapping efforts to all of the forests of South Sudan. Maps should be made publicly
       available in various formats, including a searchable online database. The Ministry should
       also consider how the survey, demarcation and registration of community forests might be
       incorporated into the community land registration process. Mapping activities should be
       conducted in conjunction with dispute resolution and conflict mitigation activities to address
       any disagreements that arise in the process.

      Forest Land Use Plans: The Ministry should prepare formal written land use plans for
       forests and publish them on their website. Once the SSFC is created, it can be given
       responsibility for compiling and managing information relating to forests.

      Benefit Sharing: Once the Forest Policy is passed, the benefit sharing mechanisms must be
       incorporated into law and enforced. The Ministry should review the existing contractual
       benefit sharing schemes to determine how they match with industry practice.

      Certification and Chain-of-Custody Systems: The RSS Ministry of Agriculture and
       Forestry should consider the benefits that a requirement to sign on to such programs could
       have. If desirable, it should develop a plan to work towards a system in which certification is
       mandatory.

       Conflict Management: Government efforts to map forests and register the associated rights
       should be done in conjunction with dispute resolution and conflict mitigation activities to
       address any disagreements that arise in the process.

      Support to SMEs: The RSS Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry should move ahead with
       plans to create the SSFC and mobilizing support for SMEs should be included in its
       mandate. The Ministry should identify areas in which opportunities for SMEs currently
       exist, conduct case studies to generate credible data and publicize success stories. For
       example, the Ministry could research gum acacia production in South Sudan and support
       efforts to streamline production and encourage the introduction of South Sudan gum acacia
       to the international market.

      Combating Forest Crimes: The new Forest Act could include provisions addressing forest
       crimes and laying out specific punishments for different types of crimes. Implementation
       plans for the new legislation should include mechanisms to promote its use in courts.

On Dispute Resolution

Land disputes are placing a huge burden on South Sudan’s justice system. In ord er to better manage
these disputes and reduce potentials for conflict, the Judiciary should explore options for creating
specialized courts to manage land disputes in urban areas. Any such initiative could begin with a
comprehensive assessment of the various forms of administrative and judicial mechanisms that are
currently being used to resolve disputes. Additional policy options include the following:



                                                 99
                                                                                                DRAFT
      Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR): ADR can help to resolve disputes in an efficient
       manner before they reach court. The government should formalize its position on ADR and
       traditional dispute resolution as a means of reducing the burden on the formal system.

      Non-documentary Evidence: The Judiciary should clarify its position on the use of non-
       documentary evidence during land disputes. Provision should be made for witness testimony
       and other evidence showing ownership, such as the presence of family graves or other
       evidence of long-standing occupancy.

      Institutional Linkages: The Judiciary should establish better linkages with other land
       governance institutions, such as the state-level Ministries of Physical Infrastructure and the
       Survey Department. Improved information sharing can help to strengthen judicial processes
       and would lead to more efficient dispute resolution.

      Increasing Geographical Coverage in the Formal System: Developing of court circuits
       where one court travels between counties can help to increase access while additional
       statutory courts are being built.

      Promoting Better Coherence Between the Statutory and Customary System: Referrals
       of cases from statutory courts to customary courts could include instructions on applicable
       law, especially for cases involving women and children’s property rights. The Supreme
       Court could also issue an advisory opinion that makes clear that customary laws that are
       inconsistent with the constitution cannot be applied in statutory or customary courts.

      Revisiting Court Fees and Lawyer Fees: The Judiciary should revisit the manner in which
       court fees and lawyer fees are assessed to see if they are presenting barriers to access.

      Case Reporting: The Judiciary should establish a case reporting system that publishes
       decisions in a systematic manner. This is an important public service and could help to
       strengthen the common law system and better contribute to rights recognition through the
       courts.

      Specialized Land Courts: The Judiciary should examine the use of specialized courts for
       land disputes. It could explore options for operationalizing those courts along the lines of
       what is detailed in the Land Act.

      Improving Enforcement of Judicial Decisions: The Judiciary should examine methods of
       improving the enforcement of judicial decisions, particularly against parties that wield
       military or political authority. Military justice has in the past assisted the civilian courts in
       enforcing decisions on military personnel that have grabbed plots. This relationship should
       be formalized in an official agreement between the institutions.

On Innovation, Impact Evaluation and Further Research

Since the end of the war in 2005, the Government of South Sudan and its development partners
have implemented a variety of programs relevant to land governance. There is a need to compile the
lessons learned from these past projects, determine where gaps arise and develop plans for up-
scaling interventions to the national level. Additional research is also needed to better understand
and document issues in the land sector. Specific research opportunities include the following:

      Comparative Research on Land in Constitutional and Legislative Frameworks: In

                                                  100
                                                                                          DRAFT
    developing the constitutional and legislative framework for land governance in South Sudan,
    law-makers should first examine how similar land issues are treated in other contexts.
    Research should be conducted on the manner in which different countries treat different
    types of land issues. Since community land rights have been identified as a particular source
    of contention in South Sudan, the research should devote attention to examining how
    community land rights are managed in other contexts. The comparative research could also
    put forward sample legal provisions that could be incorporated into the proposed legislative
    reforms and the constitutional review process. Regional dialogues with stakeholders
    throughout South Sudan could help to tailor the research to the South Sudanese context and
    generate support for proposed legal reforms.

   Research on the Role of Traditional Authorities in Land Governance: Additional
    research is required to understand the role of traditional authority and how community
    institutions vary among groups. Research should also examine the relationship between
    community institutions and local government.

   Research on Land Registration Processes: There is a need for additional research to better
    understand existing land registration processes. Research could be geared to capture the
    range of registration processes that current exist in the regional centers of Juba, Wau and
    Malakal, the state capitals and larger counties, and the less developed county and payam
    headquarters. This research could feed into efforts to develop a unified land registration
    system.

   Research on Expropriation: Additional research should be conducted on the circumstances
    in which land is being expropriated in South Sudan, particularly in relation to investments in
    the extractives industry. The RSS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning could
    use this research to inform the development of guidelines on expropriation. Once developed,
    these guidelines should be disseminated at the state and local levels and a process should be
    established to monitor and enforce their use.

   Research on Forest Crimes: Additional research about the circumstances in which forest
    crimes arise and their links with international black market trade in forest and animal
    products could help in the design of policies to combat forest crimes.

   South-South Learning: Government institutions should maximize opportunities for South-
    South learning by soliciting advice from other developing nations that have faced similar
    challenges. Many government institutions are already involved in such capacity-building
    initiatives. The Ministry of Petroleum and Mining, for example, has solicited advice from
    the Government of Botswana on developing its regulatory framework for mining. Other
    institutions, however, have been reluctant to engage with experts from other African
    countries. By taking stock of different approaches that have been taken to South-South
    learning across government institutions, the Government can identify those programs that
    have yielding positive results and promote them in a more systematic manner.

   Future LGAF Studies: In order to more fully develop and substantiate LGAF results for
    South Sudan, LGAF studies could be conducted regionally in Malakal (for Greater Upper
    Nile Region) and Wau (for Greater Bahr-el-Ghazal region). These studies could focus on the
    indicators that provided the most useful findings in the national LGAF. Studies could also
    be conducted on areas designated for specific development projects, such as areas
    designated for oil pipelines or international transit corridors. The LGAF could also be
    conducted in border areas to better understand and monitor the land issues that arise with
    respect to border demarcation and cross-border movement of transhumant populations.

1             Most forest land is mapped and rights are registered.

              Land acquisition generates few conflicts and these are addressed
2
              expeditiously and transparently.

3             Land use restrictions on rural land parcels can generally be identified.

              Public institutions involved in land acquisition operate in a clear and
4
              consistent manner.

5             Incentives for investors are clear, transparent and consistent.
              Benefit sharing mechanisms regarding investments in agriculture (food
6             crops, biofuels, forestry, livestock, game farm/conservation) are
              regularly used and transparently applied.
              There are direct and transparent negotiations between right holders and
7
              investors.
              Sufficient information is required from investors to assess the
8
              desirability of projects on public/communal land.
              For cases of land acquisition on public/community land, investors
9             provide the required information and this information is publicly
              available.
              Contractual provisions regarding acquisition of land from communities
10            or the public are required by law to explicitly mention the way in which
              benefits and risks will be shared.
              The procedure to obtain approval for a project where it is required is
11
              reasonably short.

           Environmental requirements for large-scale investments in agriculture
13
           are clearly defined and implemented.
           For transfers of public/community lands, public institutions have
14         procedures in place to identify and select economically, environmentally,
           and socially beneficial investments and implement these effectively.
           Compliance with safeguards related to investment in agriculture is
15
           checked.
           There are avenues to lodge complaints if agricultural investors do not
16
           comply with requirements.
