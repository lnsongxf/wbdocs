1.5.2 Study Locations
In Papua, the study was conducted in three
kabupaten, namely Kabupaten Yahukimo,
Kabupaten Merauke, and Kabupaten Dogiyai. As
shown in Figure 1.1, Kabupaten Yahukimo is located
in the highlands and characterized by mountains and
valleys; Kabupaten Dogiyai is a mountainous region
strategically located as it connects the Nabire coast
with the Paniai-Enarotali mountains via the Trans-
Papua highway that crosses the kabupaten; and
Kabupaten Merauke represents a coastal lowland        Figure 1.2
area.                                                 Map of Study Area in West Papua Province

In West Papua, the study was conducted in two
kabupaten, namely Kabupaten Kaimana and
Kabupaten Teluk Bintuni. As Figure 1.2 illustrates,
Kabupaten Kaimana is located on the southern coast
of West Papua and its population is distributed
along the coast and islands, marked by hills in
several areas; and Kabupaten Teluk Bintuni is
located on the bird’s head and neck of Papua island,
with diverse characteristics, including marshes,
coastal areas, cliffs, and jungle. In both kabupaten
there are several large-scale mining and oil and gas
investments.

In each kabupaten the research team selected
two sub-districts (kecamatan) as study locations.
The first sub-district represented those with good
accessibility, while the second represented those
with more difficult accessibility. In each sub-
district, the researchers then selected two villages.
The selection of sub-districts and villages was
determined by the researchers in consultation with
kabupaten-level facilitators by considering the
social and geographic conditions, as well as the
political and cultural diversity. Table 1.1 provides an
illustration of the conditions of the villages and sub-
districts selected as research locations.

This chapter presents the voices and experiences of communities in the province of Papua regarding the
PNPM/RESPEK program. As explained in Chapter 1, the RESPEK program joined PNPM Mandiri in 2008 and
                         the two programs have remained combined until today.

The topography of Kabupaten Yahukimo
complicates project implementation, particularly
because the kabupaten and sub-district facilitators
were based in Wamena, the capital town of
Kabupaten Jayawijaya, and the sub-district town of
Dekai. As a result, facilitators made modifications
to the program, for instance by coordinating the
timing of the activities so that community meetings
could take place in close succession. In addition,
facilitators arranged for funds to be disbursed
at the same time as community meetings.
However, one of the consequences of this was
that possibilities for community proposals and
participation were more limited.

  Due to the isolated and remote location, many areas in Kabupaten Yahukimo have problems with availability of basic infrastructure and access to education, clean water, health, and
electricity. According to National Team for Acceleration of Poverty Alleviation (Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan, or TNP2K), Kabupaten Yahukimo is considered a high
priority area for poverty reduction due to low levels of school participation (primary and secondary), high infant mortality, high malnutrition, and low access to clean water, sanitation, and
electricity.

   Due to difficulties in obtaining a recent/updated map of Kabupaten Yahukimo this report makes use of a map from 2006 that only shows 45 sub-districts in Kabupaten Yahukimo.

Figure 2.3 shows the research sub-districts and
the village locations. Information gathering for
this research was conducted in Urumb and Matara
villages in Semangga sub-district, and Kweel and
Bupul villages in Elikobel sub-district. The reasons
for selecting these locations included the relatively
easy accessibility from the capital town of Merauke.
Bapul and Kweel villages in Elikobel sub-district,
although relatively far from Merauke town (± 180-
200 km), can be reached in about five hours by car.
The other two villages, Matara and Urumb, are in
Semangga sub-district, which is close to Merauke
town, at about 30 km, with a travel time of around
one hour.

   The establishment of Kabupaten Merauke was based on Law No. 12/1969 on the Formation of Autonomous West Irian Province and Autonomous Districts in West Irian Province. In 2002,
based on Law No. 26/ 2002, Kabupaten Merauke was divided into four sub-districts, namely Merauke (the main district), Boven Digoel, Mappi and Asmat. Since 2002, Kabupaten Merauke
has consisted of 20 sub-districts, 160 villages and 8 urban wards (kelurahan).

   Former-migrants are second or third generations of migrants who have moved away from their original migration locations.

the consequences of this was that the program

                            IN PNPM/RESPEK IN PAPUA AND WEST PAPUA

Experiences of communities of the PNPM/RESPEK programs in the 20 villages in Papua and West Papua
provide valuable insights into how the programs were actually implemented, how they influenced the lives of
people within communities and, most importantly, how members of the community viewed and understood
the programs. The experiences also provided a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced PNPM/
RESPEK implementation and the results in terms of community knowledge, levels of participation, and the
programs’ impacts. This chapter elaborates on the overall picture of these three aspects and the factors
                                              affecting them.

                                                     This situation was largely the result of the
                                                     incentives of facilitators: their performance was
                                                     judged and evaluated based on their capacity to
                                                     fulfil the program’s administrative requirements,
                                                     namely, ensuring that the program stages, fund
                                                     disbursements and reporting requirements were
                                                     delivered in a timely manner, while at the same
                                                     time limiting the misuse of funds. This imposed
                                                     significant pressure on the facilitators to try to
                                                     complete all the administrative requirements by the
                                                     end of the project cycle. Because of this emphasize
                                                     on administrative compliance, facilitators’ training
                                                     was also mainly focused on understanding of the
                                                     program’s procedures and requirements, and
                                                     not on how to facilitate/encourage communities’
                                                     involvement in the program. Also, sub-district
                                                     facilitators were required to attend monthly
                                                     coordination meetings at the district level to report
                                                     on project progress. Due to geographic conditions
                                                     in Papua and West Papua, this requirement
                                                     sometimes meant that sub-district facilitators
