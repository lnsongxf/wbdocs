                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.      The objective of this report was to address the concerns with respect to potential
disincentive effects to labor participation of the only poverty-targeted social protection
program in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Monthly Benefit for Poor Families with Children
(MBPF). The benefit provided by the program is the only social assistance transfer in the
Kyrgyz Republic specifically targeted at extremely poor households with children. It is a
means-tested transfer that provides monthly cash benefits to lift per capita income of each
child in eligible households to the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI). The report examined
the MBPF from different angles. First, the report reviewed the design features of the MBPF,
focusing on the targeting method and the size of the benefit, with respect to household
incomes, consumption and formal and informal wages by economic sector. Secondly, it
compared the demographic profile, including labor force participation outcomes, of MBPF
beneficiaries to that of non-beneficiaries. The comparison of the labor force participation
status of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries focused on the group of people which could be
expected to be economically active and have children. The reference group was comprised of
the able-bodied working age population (aged 18-62 years old), excluding full time students,
living in households with children under 18 years old. Thirdly, it empirically analyzed the
potential disincentives for labor force participation of the MBPF, using a quasi-experimental
method to analyze the difference in labor market outcomes between MBPF beneficiaries and
individuals with similar characteristics, but which are not receiving a transfer.

Main findings

2.      With respect to the design features of the program, the report concluded that the
targeting method and the determination of the benefit level might create disincentives for
labor force participation for MBPF beneficiaries. The design of the MBPF, whereby the
size of the benefit and eligibility are determined in relation to the GMI may induce
beneficiaries from reporting additional income and may deter them from accepting
(additional) work if the expected wage only marginally exceeds the GMI. This is explained
by the fact that each additional Som earned would reduce the MBPF transfer by one Som.
Furthermore, eligibility to in-kind transfers linked to MBPF receipt lifts the marginal tax for
any income earned above the GMI to over 100 percent. However, given the small size of the
benefit, it is unlikely that the MBPF creates disincentives for labor force participation. On
average, the maximum amount of MBPF benefits a household is entitled to is considerably
lower than the wage this household could earn in the formal and informal labor market. The
comparison of different hypothetical households with respect to their earning potential and
the GMI indicates that income from work exceeds transfer income. In addition, employment
in the formal and informal sector is likely to pay off, with the exception of informal
employment in the agricultural sector (planting), where the earning potential is below a full
MBPF transfer.
3.  Household composition differs between MBPF beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries.
MBPF households tend to have a higher dependency ratio when compared to non-

                                              v
beneficiary households. Fifty-five percent of total MBPF beneficiaries live in households
with a dependency ratio above one, which indicates that the number of elderly and children
exceeds the number of able-bodied adults. For the poorest 40 percent of non-beneficiaries,
this share is 20 percent, while for the richest 60 percent of non-beneficiary households this
share is only 10 percent. Children represent the majority of MBPF beneficiaries. More than
half of the MBPF households have six or more household members, but this also applies to
the poor non-beneficiary households. The majority of MBPF beneficiaries are located in rural,
non-mountainous and Southern oblasts. Osh and Naryn are the oblasts with the highest benefit
incidence.
4.      Seasonal differences in labor force participation are more evident for MBPF
beneficiaries compared to other poor non-beneficiaries. Labor force participation rates are
higher for able-bodied adults, aged 18-62 years old and living in households with children and
range between 77.7 and 79.5 percent over the year. MBPF beneficiaries have higher
participation rates compared to poor non-beneficiaries. The higher level of activity in the
second and third quarters, and the fact that the majority of beneficiaries is living in rural areas,
suggests that beneficiaries are more likely to be involved in agriculture activities than non-
beneficiaries. Unemployment rates in 2012 started at a relatively high 9.4 percent in the first
quarter and declined to 5.3 percent at the end of the year. MBPF beneficiaries were
particularly hard hit with unemployment in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the rest of
the population. However, in the second half of 2012, unemployment rates for beneficiaries
were slightly lower than for the others.
5.      MBPF beneficiaries living in rural areas have higher labor force participation rates
compared to non-beneficiaries in rural areas and to beneficiaries in urban areas. Farm
labor is the predominant economic activity for MBPF beneficiaries; almost 50 percent of the
adults who can be expected to work and living in MBPF households are engaged in farm
labor. Given that wages in the informal agricultural sector are very low, it seems reasonable
to assume that income from work in these households is relatively low. MBPF beneficiaries
living in the North have lower labor force participation rates compared to non-beneficiaries
in the same region and beneficiaries living in Southern oblasts.
6.      Informal employment and informal transfers from relatives play an important role
in the household economy. MBPF beneficiaries are more likely to be engaged in informal
employment compared to non-beneficiaries. Informal employment appears to be less
common among non-beneficiaries with a higher level of consumption. Money from relatives
is an important component of the household income of MBPF beneficiaries. Activity rates are
lower among MBPF recipients with remittances compared to other groups.
7.      Household heads are more active in the labor market than other adult household
members and they are less affected by seasonal variations. Compared to poor non-
beneficiaries, household heads from MBPF recipient households tend to have slightly lower
participation rates, but their spouses have higher activity rates. Overall, participation rates of
spouses in poor households are clearly lower than for spouses living in a MBPF household.
Housekeeping and childcare are the main occupations for inactive MBPF beneficiaries.
8.      Overall, the empirical analysis in this report indicates that the MBPF does not
create disincentives for labor force participation for those living in rural areas or
Southern oblasts, but it might be an issue for beneficiaries living in the North. Since



                                                vi
MBPF beneficiaries predominantly live in rural areas and are engaged in farming activities,
seasonal effects have a bigger impact on labor force participation for beneficiaries when
compared to non-beneficiaries from the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution.
Although MBPF beneficiaries are not less likely to work, benefit receipt negatively affects
the amount of hours worked, indicating a potential issue of ‘under-employment’ rather than
unemployment in rural areas. Not only does the MBPF have a negative impact on the hours
worked, beneficiaries also earn a lower wage per hour compared to similar employed non-
beneficiaries. MBPF receipt also increases the likelihood that employment is in the
informal sector.
9.      Regional and seasonal effects on labor market outcomes should be further
investigated. The analysis in this report indicates that the labor market in the Kyrgyz Republic
follows a seasonal pattern with more work opportunities during the summer months. This has
implications for able-bodied individuals looking for work. Despite high levels of labor market
participation both among MBPF beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, making ends meet
remains difficult for many household given the low wages in the agricultural sector, where
most of the poor in rural areas are engaged.

1.1     The main objectives of social protection policies are to protect households in the
event of a temporary or permanent reduction in earnings capacity and reduce the risk of
poverty and vulnerability. The Kyrgyz social protection system includes both contributory
(pensions and unemployment insurance) and non-contributory (social assistance) transfers.
Pensions, protecting against income loss related to old age, disability and loss of breadwinner
are the most prevalent type of transfers. Non-contributory social transfers, including social
transfers to the poor and disabled, categorical benefits and energy compensations do not
depend on previous contributions. They are aimed at reducing poverty and supporting the
well-being of vulnerable households to make ends meet.

1.2     The Monthly Benefit for Poor Families with Children (MBPF) is the only social
assistance transfer in the Kyrgyz Republic specifically targeted at extremely poor
households with children. It is a means-tested transfer whereby eligibility depends on average
family income being below the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI). Means-tested social
transfers can be very efficient in allocating scarce government resources to the groups most
in need of support and limit leakage to the non-poor. The potential disadvantages are inclusion
and exclusion errors arising from the administrative assessment of family income, private and
social costs for the applicants, such as costs related to documentation requirements,
opportunity costs and stigmatization of beneficiaries. Moreover, due to the strict application
of income criteria, poverty-targeted cash transfers may negatively affect the labor market
participation of beneficiaries. The latter may occur as result of reduced job search intensity of
transfer recipients or the willingness to accept work if the expected wage is only marginally
higher than the social transfer (Guzi, 2013). Benefit receipt may negatively affect the labor
market participation of other household members, or influence the choice between formal and
informal sector jobs. If income tests focus on formal income, beneficiaries may be pushed
into the informal sector in order to maintain their benefit eligibility (Tesliuc et al., 2014).
Previous studies of the MBPF have focused on the targeting performance and benefit
adequacy. They conclude that the MBPF is predominantly reaching the poor, but that the
targeting system results in sizeable exclusion errors and that the benefit adequacy in terms of
poverty reduction is limited due to the low levels of transfers (World Bank, 2009; Gassmann,
2011, 2013).

1.3      This report aims to address the concerns with respect to potential work disincentive
effects of the MBPF. While there may be valid theoretical reasons to be concerned about the
design of the MBPF, the popular perceptions about benefit dependency need to be tested
empirically. More specifically, the objectives of this report are to critically assess the MBPF’s
eligibility conditions, and to empirically estimate the potential labor disincentive effects of
the MBPF. The focus of the analysis is on labor market participation and employment,
irrespective whether employment occurs in the formal or informal sector, given that 70 percent
of employment in the Kyrgyz Republic is informal (Schwegler-Rohmeis, 2013). Therefore, work
disincentive refers to the potential effect of the MBPF to discourage adults from participation
and employment. First, the report reviews the design features of the MBPF, such as the

                                               1
targeting method, and the size of the benefit with respect to household incomes, consumption
and formal and informal wages by economic sector. Secondly, it compares the demographic
profile (including employment status, work effort and earning) of MBPF beneficiaries to that
of non-beneficiaries, who live in households sharing similar characteristics. Thirdly, the report
empirically estimates the impact of the MBPF on labor market participation and employment.

1.4     The literature on social transfers in developing and transition economies highlights
the various potential effects on labor supply by the participating households. These labor
supply effects are important for the evaluation of any antipoverty transfer programs.
According to Barrientos & Villa (2013, p.3), “antipoverty programs are not welfarist. […] An
antipoverty income transfer leading to a proportional reduction in labor supply, and therefore
income, could well be welfare enhancing, but would be considered a failure in its own, non-
welfarist, terms”.

1.5     Economic theory highlights program features, which are designed to either induce
employment or discourage certain target groups from participating in the labor market.
According to economic theory, under competitive market conditions, income transfers reduce
labor supply at the margin by raising the wage needed to attract these workers into the labor
market. For example, social pensions reduce the labor supply of older people, and conditional
cash transfer programs affect child labor by making school attendance a requirement for
receipt of the transfer. However, these are unequivocally intended and desirable labor supply
outcomes of the programs (ILO, 2010).

1.6      Empirical evidence from developing countries suggests that the effect of targeted
social assistance programs results in re-allocation of resources within the households
resulting in an increase of adult labor participation. The adult labor supply responses of
households benefiting from antipoverty income transfer programs have been studied for
different countries. Studies on programs in Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Ethiopia and
Bangladesh suggest that there are reductions in the labor participation rate among children
and older people, where programs target these groups, but these reductions are compensated
for by increased adult labor. Among adults, labor supply effects were found to be positive for
Brazil and South Africa. According to the study, the households worked through a reallocation
of their resources, which was enabled by the regularity of the transfer (ILO, 2010).

1.7     The empirical literature on the relationship between social assistance programs
and work disincentives in transition economies suggests that the negative labor supply
effects remain limited. In transition economies, social assistance benefits were intensified
in the early 1990s, as poverty increased. European countries were ahead of Eurasian
countries in implementing social assistance: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the
Slovak Republic approved social assistance legislation that built on existing programs;
Estonia, Latvia, and FYR Macedonia introduced means-tested social assistance programs.
“In 1995 the Kyrgyz Republic became the first Eurasian country to adopt a national poverty
benefit” (World Bank, 2000, p.26). Along the years, most of the analyses on labor supply
effects did not find negative effects. This is also highlighted in the case study on Armenia.
In Armenia, Levin & Ersado (2011) do not find that the beneficiaries of the Family Benefit
Program (FBP) work less because of the program: the estimates of program effects show
no significant negative impacts on inactivity and informality; for the rural sample, negative


                                               2
effects were only verified in the number of hours worked. A decrease of seven percentage
points in the probability of working or looking for a job has been found in Georgia, but the
analyses revealed that rather the provision of free health insurance to social assistance
beneficiaries affected labor market decisions. In Tajikistan, social assistance transfers had
a positive effect on adult employment rates in female-headed households, indicating the
importance of the safety net for the transition from inactivity or informality into
employment (Arias & Sanchez-Paramo, 2014). Due to low benefit levels, work
disincentives of last resort programs remain limited, as confirmed by a recent study on the
Western Balkan (Gotcheva & Sundaram, 2013).

1.8      Likewise, it is suggested in certain case-specific evaluations that the design
elements of the program have the potential to positively impact any labor supply effects.
In Romania’s antipoverty income transfers program, two design elements could mitigate
work disincentives: (i) the work requirements applied to all able-bodied beneficiaries; and
(ii) an exit threshold that is set higher than the eligibility threshold (Grosh et al., 2008). A
qualitative evaluation of the Guaranteed Minimum Income Program found indeed little
evidence of an adverse impact on labor force participation: “because there is a small bonus
for employment, there may be a small positive impact on participation compared with more
traditional systems of aid” (Grosh et al., 2008, p.142).

1.9     Particular groups of the population may have a higher chance to refrain from the
labor market when they receive a social benefit. To exemplify, Guzi (2013) finds evidence
of a negative effect on labor, as result of social programs in the Czech Republic. The author
presents evidence of a welfare trap created by the tax and social security system:
individuals, and especially women, who receive relatively higher social benefits, have a
higher probability to remain unemployed.

1.10 A key issue relates to potential effect of pushing beneficiaries of poverty-targeted
transfers into the informal labor market. Particularly those with low skills or working in low
paid jobs have fewer incentives to graduate into fulltime (formal) work (Gotcheva &
Sundaram, 2013). In situations with a high tax wedge on earned (formal) income, beneficiaries
may opt for not working at all or staying in the informal sector to avoid withdrawal from
social assistance (Koettl, 2013; Koettl & Weber, 2012). This is particularly an issue where
benefit eligibility is assessed based on formal income (Packard et al., 2012).

1.11 The remainder of this report is structured as follows: the next section provides the
background for the subsequent analysis, including an overview of the current social protection
system, the labor market and recent poverty developments. It also describes the data and
methodology used for the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the MBPF in more detail
and critically assesses potential work disincentives arising from the design of the MBPF.
Sections 4 and 5 contain the empirical analysis based on data from the Kyrgyz Integrated
Household Survey (KIHS). Section 4 compares the demographic profile of MBPF
beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries. Section 5 extends the empirical analysis of potential
work disincentives of the MBPF using binary models and quasi-experimental methods to
analyze the difference in labor market behavior between MBPF beneficiaries and individuals
with similar characteristics, but which are not receiving a transfer. Section 5 concludes.

                                   A.   SOCIAL PROTECTION

2.1 The social protection system of the Kyrgyz Republic comprises both contributory (i.e.
social insurance) and non-contributory (i.e social assistance) benefits which play an
important role in helping individuals and families cope with income shocks. The social
insurance component protects citizens with a formal employment record or contribution
history against the risks of old age, disability, loss of breadwinner and unemployment. The
social assistance component consists of several non-contributory social benefits: categorical
state benefits, energy compensations, the Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) and the Monthly
Benefit for Poor Families with children (MBPF) are the four main programs. Firstly,
categorical state benefits are allocated to specific groups of privileged or vulnerable citizens,
independent of household income. Secondly, energy compensations are provided to
pensioners with a small pension and to households living in high-mountain areas. Thirdly, the
MSB is a categorical benefit targeted to vulnerable groups with limited income generating
opportunities. It is an income maintenance program providing a social pension to people with
disabilities, orphans, and elderly without pension rights. The MSB is assigned irrespective of
the income of the beneficiary and allocates flat amounts in the range of KGS 1,000 – 3,000.
Lastly, the MBPF is a means-tested, non-contributory benefit targeted to poor households
with children. It is a variable benefit and covers the gap between the Guaranteed Minimum
Income (GMI) and the average per capita family income for eligible beneficiaries, including
both formal and informal income and assets.

2.2 About half of the Kyrgyz population lives in a household receiving some kind of
social protection transfer. As indicated in Table 2.1, old age and disability pensions are by
far the most important programs, covering 43 percent of the Kyrgyz population. These
contribution-based programs protect citizens against the risk of old age and disability and
provide benefits to those with a formal employment record or contribution history. Although
pensions primarily serve the objective of income redistribution over a lifetime, they play an
important role for poverty reduction (Gassmann, 2011). All other, mainly non-contributory,
social transfers are relatively small and reach between one and seven percent of the
population, with the exception of energy compensations. Private transfers, including
remittances from migrants abroad, also play a major role given that one fifth of the population
regularly receives money from relatives.

2.3 In 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic spent about 5.7 percent of GDP on social protection
programs (excluding pensions); however, concerns remain with respect to the
effectiveness of the programs. Between 2008 and 2012, expenditures for non-contributory
social protection quadrupled (Table 2.2). The largest increase occurred from 2009 to 2010
(2.2 percentage points) due to the reform of non-contributory social protection programs.
The increase in spending did not result in an extension of the coverage of the poor, but
rather in an increase of benefit levels of existing beneficiaries.

2.4 The international financial and economic crisis at the end of the last decade, as well
as the political turmoil in 2010 had a detrimental effect on the Kyrgyz economy, which is


                                                  5
characterized by its dependence on export of gold and remittances. The slow-down of the
economy with negative growth rates in 2010 and 2012 put pressure on the government budget.
According to the IMF (2013), the fiscal deficit reached 5.4 percent of GDP in 2012, a value
below the targeted 6 percent of GDP, though higher than in 2011.

2.5 To mitigate the effects of the international and domestic crises on the population, the
GoKG has increased the level of social expenditures, wages and pensions (IMF, 2013).
Mogilevsky & Omorova (2011) confirm that social spending has always been a large
component of government expenditures in Kyrgyz Republic. The share of social spending in
general government expenditures has been above or equal to 40 percent since 1990. In the
2000s, the GoKG sustained the shares of education and health in government expenditures.
At the same time, starting from the late-1990s, the share of social protection was on the decline
until 2010. This was the result of decreases of social benefits in real terms and of pensions in
relation to wages.1 In 2012, the share of social protection reached 1990s level (Error!

1 According to Mogilevsky & Omorova (2011, p. 20), because total government resources were shrinking both
in real terms and as a percentage of GDP in the 1990s, even the increase in the share of social expenditures did
not prevent them from falling sharply in absolute terms. All social expenditures per capita decreased in real terms
by 2-4 times in 2000 from the 1990 levels. The situation changed in the 2000s, when all social expenditures
demonstrated significant real growth – particularly in education and housing and community services, and less so
in social protection.

                                      B.   LABOR MARKET

2.6 The Kyrgyz labor market is characterized by insufficient labor demand, a changing
composition of employment by economic sector, high informality and a sizeable gender gap.
Over the last two decades, the labor force (individuals participating in the labor market, either
employed or unemployed) frequently grew more rapidly than the annual growth of
employment (Figure 2.2). From 2003 to 2010, the total number of jobs increased in total by
about 315,000. However, only 14 percent of total jobs created referred to regular jobs in
enterprises. Self-employment and employment of individuals hired by individual citizens
increased from 550,000 up to 910,000 (Schwegler-Rohmeis, 2013, p.9). Over the same
period, the structure of employment changed considerably (Figure 2.3). The percentage of the
labor force employed in agriculture decreased from 49 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2011,
while employment in other sectors, notably services, grew with ten percentage points over the
same period reaching 45 percent in 2011. Employment in the industrial sector, after a decrease
in the 1990s, recovered in early 2000 and is back to the levels of the early nineties. In 2011,
the industrial sector employed 19 percent of the labor force.

2.7      Approximately 70 percent of employment is informal. In rural areas, up to 80 percent
of employment is informal compared to 50 percent in urban areas. The sectors with the highest
share of informal employment are agriculture, trade, catering, transport and industry. Almost
two thirds of those working in the informal sector are self-employed (Schwegler-Rohmeis,
2013). Informal employment is an effective strategy for poverty alleviation in the mid-term,
but may have a negative impact on long-term economic development of the country. Over-
employment and other precarious employment conditions are often a product of the informal
economy, and are more frequent for the self-employed in sectors such as trade, repair of
vehicles and household appliances, transport and communication, hotels and restaurants and
construction (Schwegler-Rohmeis, 2013). Under-employment, on the other hand, is rather a
rural phenomenon. Although unemployment rates are lower in rural areas, the work intensity
is less and seasonal employment is more frequent, which partly explains the higher poverty
rates in rural areas.

2.8    The employment-to-population rate is lower for women than for men. While men’s
employment rate increased from 66.4 percent in 2003 to 70.7 percent in 2010, female
employment levels remained unchanged. The same pattern holds for the younger generations
(15-24 years old) that are entering the labor market: young men increased their share while
young women significantly lost position. Furthermore, women account for higher shares of
employment in activities and occupations involving lower wages. The earnings gap between
women and men is 30 and 25 percent respectively in urban and rural areas (Schwegler-
Rohmeis, 2013).

                                              C.      MIGRATION

An estimated 15-20 percent of Kyrgyz Republic’s total population currently works abroad.2
The main migration destination is Russia (92 percent), followed by Kazakhstan (Vinkurov,
2013). The lack of labor demand in Kyrgyz Republic is the main push factor for migration.
However, remittances sent back by migrant workers accounted for 25 percent of GDP in 2010.
Forty-five percent of the migrants send on average 30–50 percent of their earnings home every
year (Vinokurov, 2013). Estimates based on the KIHS 2012 indicate that 31 percent of the
Kyrgyz population received reliefs received by the household from relatives or friends and
income from employment outside the country (Error! Reference source not found.),
and 19.6 percent reported that they have received remittances and income from outside the
country3. Remittances from labor migrants abroad are a positive externality. Just as informal
employment, labor migration is an effective strategy for poverty alleviation in the mid-term,
but may have negative externalities for long-term economic development of the country.
According to Schwegler-Rohmeis (2013, p.10), there is evidence that the level of individual
consumption experiences remittance dependency: “[…] the 15 percent decline in remittances
registered in 2009 corresponds to a 15 percent decline in individual consumption reported in
that year”.

                                                 D.    POVERTY

2.9     After years of declining poverty rates, the country has witnessed increasing poverty
rates after 2009. In 2012, 38 percent of the population was living below the absolute poverty
line. Four percent of the population is considered extremely poor, which means that their level
of consumption is below the minimum food poverty line (Error! Reference source not
found.).

2 Vinokurov (2013) highlights that labor migration is a topic under-researched, which results in inconsistence
between basic statistical data. According to the author, expert estimates of the true number of migrant workers
might range from 620,000 for 2010 to one million for 2012.

2.10 Poverty rates are particularly higher in Southern4 oblasts and in rural areas. Fifty
percent of the population located in the Southern oblasts - Osh, Jalal-Abad and Batken –
are poor. In the Northern oblasts, the poverty rate is 24.5 percent. Jalal-Abad and Osh, which
represent approximately 45 percent of the country’s population, hold more than 60 percent of
the total poor population. This is reflected by the incidence of poverty in both oblasts: the
absolute poverty rate in Jalal-Abad is 55.8 percent and 51.4 percent in Osh. Moreover, more
than 60 percent of the extremely poor live in Jalal-Abad. Bishkek, which represents 15.8
percent of the country’s population, holds 8.9 percent of total poor people. Poverty is
predominantly a rural phenomenon: 65.9 percent of the poor are living in rural areas (Table
2.4).

2.11 Both children and people living in larger households face a particularly high risk
of living in poverty. According to Table 2.4, 25.7 percent of individuals living in households
with no children below age 6 are poor. The incidence of poverty rises to 44.2 percent for
individuals living in households with one child below age 6 and keeps rising in the subsequent
groups reaching 79.8 percent for individuals living in households with three children and 97.9
percent for those with 4 children or more below age 6. Fifty-three percent of all children below
the age of 6 are poor. The incidence of poverty falls to 40.4 percent among children between
6 and 18 years old and keeps dropping in the subsequent age groups.

                                     E.    DATA AND METHODOLOGY

2.12 The 2012 Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey (KIHS) is the study’s main source
of data, alongside other pertinent data from evaluations of existing safety nets programs.
The analysis in this report is based on available information on MBPF design, existing studies
and evaluations prepared by the Government, Development Partners and NGOs.

2.13 The KIHS is an annual integrated household cross section survey with some panel
features, collecting data since 2003. It has a unique structure: a maximum of one quarter of
households are replaced in each year; households are not tracked over time if they are
dissolved or move within Kyrgyz Republic. In addition, while household ID codes are unique
and consistent over the years, the individual ID codes are not unique to individuals.
Individuals are simply numbered serially in each household, which may give the same
individual ID code to different individuals if there are changes in the household composition
over time. Consequently, there are concerns about the representativeness of the cross-
sectional samples as well as the panel sub-samples (Esenaliev, Kroeger & Steiner, 2011).

2.14 The analysis in this report is based on the KIHS data for 2012. It contains
information on 5,000 households. Households participating in the KIHS are visited four times
per year. The survey provides detailed information on the demographic composition of the
household, incomes, expenditures, housing, assets and labor. The labor module of the KIHS
collects labor force data for present and migrant individuals 15 years and older at quarterly
level. Due to seasonal events, it is likely that an individual’s participation in the labor market
varies throughout the year. Therefore, the information used for the labor market analysis is
based on quarterly data, but only considers present individuals in the household. Although
quarterly data is used for the analysis, the weights used for the estimations are annual weights.
This does not compromise the analysis and might only lead to minor differences in
estimations.

2.15 The labor market participation status is based on the definitions applied by the
National Statistics Committee (NSC). Using the LFS, the NSC identifies whether an
individual is employed, unemployed or inactive (see Box 1). Although the NSC definition for
employed follows the ILO convention, it does not consider individuals engaged in unpaid
informal activities. The analysis therefore applies a second definition for employment,
referred to as employment extended. It includes individuals engaged in informal unpaid
activities, such as working on the plot, in the forest, or the own production of goods.

2.16 The analysis of the labor market outcomes of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries
will focus on the group of people, which can be expected to be economically active and have
children. Therefore, the able-bodied working age population (aged 18-62 years old),
excluding full time students5, living in households with children under 18 years old is used as
reference group, unless indicated otherwise. This group represents 39.8 percent of the total
population in the Kyrgyz Republic (Table 2.5).



5 Adults indicating to be day students when reporting their social status were excluded from the analysis given
the importance of education for human capital development.

2.17 The treatment group in this analysis comprises individuals aged 18-62 years old,
living in a household with children under 18 years old and which are MBPF recipient. The
term ‘MBPF beneficiary’ is used throughout the text to refer to all individuals living in a
MBPF recipient household, unless indicated otherwise.

 Box 1. Labor market definitions used in the analysis
 Active labor force (market) participation: individuals that are either employed or unemployed
 (following NSC definition).
 Employed (NSC definition): individuals who have during the week under survey any paid job or
 remunerative employment, including any additional work on the side; or are engaged in work at a family
 farm or enterprise; or took some time off during the week under survey for any reason, if the enterprise
 (business) kept on operating while they were off.
 Unemployed (NSC definition): individuals who are currently not working, yet are ready to start
 working and have actively been looking for a job.
 Employed extended: employed individuals (as above) and those engaged in unpaid work.
 Informal employment: self-employed individuals without registration or execution of documents;
 employed individuals without a formal contract or official document.
 Informal work: individuals who are informally employed (definition above) or are engaged in unpaid
 work.

3. ELIGIBILITY, PERFORMANCE AND THE POTENTIAL
                 FOR DISINCENTIVES
3.1     Although spending on the MBPF has increased considerably since 2009, the
performance in terms of coverage of the poor and impact on poverty remained more or less
the same. Based on KIHS data, around seven percent of the population lived in households
receiving the MBPF in 2012. According to administrative data from the Ministry of Social
Development (MSD), beneficiaries accounted for about six percent of the total population in
the same year. The number of beneficiaries has been steadily declining since 2005, when the
system counted more than 480 thousand beneficiaries, representing nine percent of the
population.

3.2     The benefit is paid to families with children, whose incomes are below the
guaranteed minimum income level. The size of the MBPF is determined by the difference
between the guaranteed monthly minimum income and actual per-capita monthly income in
an applicant household. In addition to calculating the recipient household’s formal and
informal monetary and in-kind incomes (e.g., from agriculture), family assets (e.g., durable
goods, draft animals) are also taken into account (Hasanov & Izmailov, 2011). Other benefits
paid to poor families with children under this program include (Hasanov & Izmailov, 2011):

      a lump-sum allowance equal to 300 percent of the guaranteed monthly income, paid
       when a child is born;

      an allowance for children below age three—100 percent of the guaranteed monthly
       income;

      an allowance for twins—100 percent of the guaranteed monthly income upon their
       birth

      an allowance for triplets (and larger births)—150 percent of the guaranteed monthly
       income upon the birth of each child

3.3     The Monthly Benefit for Poor Families with Children has a great potential to
alleviate extreme poverty and contribute to equalizing opportunities in the years of
childhood, yet coverage of the extremely poor remains limited. The number of beneficiaries
remained rather stable since 2008 and comprised 377,000 in 2011 (World Bank, 2014). In
2012, based on estimates derived from the KIHS, 7.4 percent of the population lived in a
beneficiary household (Table 3.1). The coverage is highest among the poorest households
with 13.3 percent of the population of the first (poorest 10 percent) and 19.4 percent of the
population of the second decile covered. On the other hand, there are a large number of equally
poor households that do not receive the MBPF transfers.

3.4     Although the allocation of the MBPF is progressive, benefit levels are small limiting
the poverty reduction effectiveness of the program. While the MBPF is well targeted to the
poor (more than 50 percent of total transfers are reaching the poorest 20 percent), more than
80 percent of extremely poor children below the age of 18 are not covered. Furthermore, the
benefit provided by the program is not sufficient to meet the most basic needs. In 2012, MBPF
transfers accounted for about 10 percent of total household income in the poorest households.
Therefore, the impact on poverty is limited due to its low coverage and benefit levels. This
compares negatively to programs of last resort in other countries in the region (Figure 3.1).
Only the social assistance program in Tajikistan provides transfers, which comprise an even
lower value.

3.5     The MBPF aims to provide monthly cash benefits to lift per capita income of each
child in eligible households to the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI); in 2012, the GMI
was equal to KGS 370 per month, which is less than 30 percent of the extreme poverty line.


                                                       15
While initially set at 50 percent of the extreme poverty line in 1998, the GMI was not able to
keep pace with the annual increase of the extreme poverty line. The GMI is set by government
decree depending on the available financial resources provided by the Ministry of Finance
and expected number of beneficiaries. Although the GMI adjustments have become more
regular in the past years with the objective to increase its value by 10 percent annually, the
GMI still lags behind and does not provide an adequate transfer. In 2011, the average MBPF
transfer amounted to KGS 270 per month and per child (Figure 3.2).

3.6     The MBPF represents a small fraction of total household income; income from
wage remains the most important income source. This applies both to the total population
and to the group of MBPF beneficiaries. Income from wage remains the most important
income source (71.8 percent) for MBPF beneficiary households, followed by pensions (14.1
percent). All social transfers account for 22.4 percent of total household income in MBPF
households, which is roughly the same level as in other extremely poor households. The
difference lies in the share of pensions, which constitute 14.8 percent in MBPF and 18.6
percent in households with consumption below the food poverty line. On average, the share
of wage income is slightly higher for the poor and extremely poor, compared to the MBFP
recipients. This might be a first indication that MBPF beneficiaries behave differently on the
labor market compared to other households that are equally poor. Table 3.2 also hints at the
importance of informal transfers. Overall, about 31 percent of the population lives in a
household receiving money from relatives, including informal transfers from those living
abroad and formal income from employment outside Kyrgyz Republic (Table 2.1). The
incidence of remittances (formal and informal transfers from abroad) in the Kyrgyz Republic
is 18.9 percent for people aged 18 to 62 and 30 percent for MBPF beneficiaries of the same
age group (Table A-15, Annex A). These informal and formal transfers are very important for
the recipient households. In MBPF households, money from relatives and work abroad
accounts for 18.2 percent of total household income, which is almost twice the share compared


                                                 16
to total population (11.7 percent). Considering the income composition of all individuals,
income from remittances alone account for 9.5 percent of total income. However, if only the
income composition of recipient households is accounted, the share of remittances represents
42.5 percent of total income, and among the group of MBPF beneficiaries receiving
remittances, they account for 52.3 percent of total household income.

3.7      To understand the potential for work disincentives, the GMI and average MBPF
transfer has to be compared with local salaries and minimum wage regulations. The
average monthly wage in the formal economy across sectors was KGS 10,884 in 2012 and
the lowest average wage was reported for the agriculture, hunting and forestry sector (KGS
5,454) (Table 3.3). The situation is significantly different in the informal sector (Table 3.4).
Informal labor in agriculture pays considerably less. The average monthly wage for persons
involved in planting or animal production is less than KGS 500, which is below the official
minimum wage (KGS 760 per month in 2012). The official minimum wage is governed by
the Law on Minimum Wages in the Kyrgyz Republic from October 12th, 2008, No. 210, and
the Law on the Republican Budget for 2011 and Forecast for 2012-2013 from March 30,
2011, No. 8. It is used to determine the guaranteed monthly salary for full-time unqualified
labor under normal working conditions. The minimum wage is not used for the calculation of
social transfers. However, if a worker entering retirement has no salary records, the minimum
wage is used to calculate his/her pension entitlements (Gassmann, 2013).

3.8      Given the low level of the GMI, the amount of MBPF benefits a household is
maximally entitled to is considerably less than the wage this household could earn in the
formal and informal labor market. It is therefore unlikely that the MBPF a priori creates
work disincentives, a conclusion which is also supported by Gotcheva and Sundaram for the
Western Balkans (2013). Table 3.5 compares different hypothetical households with respect
to their earning potential and the GMI, which reflects the amount a household can receive per
child if it has no income at all. In households with one working adult, the MBPF only exceeds
the minimum wage if this household has three or more children. In case of two working adults
and assuming that both earn the minimum wage, income from work exceeds transfer income.
Employment in the formal and informal sector always pays off, with the exception of informal
work in the agricultural sector, where the earning potential is clearly below a full MBPF
transfer. Hence, based on the comparison of these standard situations, there is a potential for
work disincentives for adults working informally in agriculture.

3.9      The design of the MBPF, whereby the transfer amount is equal to the gap between
total family income per capita and the GMI, in principal imposes a 100 percent marginal
tax rate on each additional Som of reported income exceeding the GMI. However, the actual
marginal tax rate may be different. It entails that the means test is strictly applied with
automatic recertification in the event that the family income situation has changed. While this
might be feasible for income from formal employment or social transfers, it is administratively
much more challenging to assess changes in informal income if households do not inform the
local authorities of such changes. The fact that each additional Som earned would reduce the
MBPF transfer by one Som may induce beneficiaries not to report additional income and may
deter them from accepting work if the expected wage only marginally exceeds the GMI. This
potential poverty trap is further enhanced by several in-kind benefits MBPF and other poor
households are entitled to. MBPF recipients are exempted from paying state charges and fees,
are eligible for free legal support, and are exempted from paying for the registration of a birth
or issuance of a passport. Financially disadvantaged citizens are exempted from co-payments
for hospital care and children from poor families with four or more children are also eligible
for free outpatient care. Local governments have the right to provide textbooks free of charge
and exempt children from paying school fees. Finally, in Bishkek pre-school children from
poor families are entitled for free school meals.6

               4. PROFILE OF MBPF BENEFICIARIES
4.1     This section compares the demographic and labor market profile of MBPF
beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries based on data from the KIHS 2012. For the
demographic profile, the group of beneficiaries comprises all individuals living in a MBPF
recipient household. Beneficiaries are compared to two groups of non-beneficiaries: the
poorest 40 percent and the top 60 percent of the population. In the first comparison the analysis
considers the difference between beneficiaries and other poor individuals (non-beneficiaries
with low consumption level), and in the second comparison the analysis looks at the difference
between beneficiaries and the non-poor population. Note that the term ‘MBPF beneficiary’
used throughout the text refers to all individuals living in a MBPF recipient household, unless
otherwise indicated.

4.2     The majority of MBPF beneficiaries are located in rural, non-mountainous and
Southern oblasts. Osh and Naryn are the oblasts with the highest benefit incidence. 85
percent of MBPF beneficiaries are living in rural areas. In line with the overall distribution of
the population, the majority of the beneficiaries (58 percent) lives in a non-mountainous
location and 78.3 percent in the Southern oblasts, which are Osh, Jalal-Abad and Batken. 50.8
percent of all MBPF beneficiaries are from Osh oblast alone, 15.3 percent are from Batken,
and 12.2 percent are from Jalalabad. MBPF beneficiaries from Issykul, Talas, Chui and
Bishkek sum up to 6.6 percent of the total beneficiaries. When comparing the distribution of
MBPF beneficiaries across oblasts to the distribution of the total population, Osh and Naryn
are the oblasts with the highest level of benefit incidence. Although only 4.7 percent of the
population lives in Naryn, the oblast accounts for 15.1 percent of all beneficiaries (Table A-
3, Annex A).

4.3     The distribution of MBPF beneficiaries across oblasts does not necessarily reflect
the distribution of the poor in the country. One would expect that the poorest oblasts account
for the majority of MBPF beneficiaries. In other words, the distribution of beneficiaries should
follow the distribution of the poor. Figure 4.1 shows two distinct patterns: Jalal-Abad and
Chui are oblasts where the share of the poor far outweighs the share of MBPF beneficiaries.
Jalal-Abad is the oblast with the highest poverty rates; both absolute and extreme (Table 2.4).
More than 60 percent of the extremely poor live in this oblast, but Jalal-Abad accounts for
only 12 percent of MBPF beneficiaries. The opposite patterns can be observed in Osh oblast,
Naryn and Batken. In these oblasts, the relative share of MBPF beneficiaries exceeds the share
of the poor. As a result, the exclusion error is considerably lower compared to the national
average. In Naryn, more than 60 percent of the poorest 10 percent of the population is
receiving the MBPF, while the exclusion error exceeds 95 percent in Jalal-Abad (Table A-4,
Annex A).

4.4     Children represent the majority of MBPF beneficiaries. Children under six years old
account for 20.9 percent of beneficiaries and 37.1 percent are children in the age group from
6 to 17 years old (Figure 4.2). Especially this latter group has an above average benefit
incidence. This concentration reflects the MBPF target at households with children, which is
also verified when analyzing the distribution of MBPF beneficiaries in relation to their status
in the household: 69.9 percent of total population living in an MBPF household are classified
as other relatives, which could be a son, daughter, parent or in-law; 18.2 percent of the total
population living in an MBPF household are classified as household head and 11.9 percent as
spouses (Table A-1, Annex A). In terms of gender, 46.1 percent of the MBPF beneficiaries
are men and 53.9 percent are women as would be expected on the basis of the population
distribution.

4.5     More than half of the MBPF households have six of more household members, but
this also applies to other poor households. Fifty five percent of MBPF beneficiaries reside
in households with 6 or more members and 42 percent live in households with 4 to 5 members
(Figure 4.3). This distribution is typical for all households in the bottom 40 percent. Only
households belonging to the richest 60 percent show a clearly different pattern with smaller
households on average. The average household size in Kyrgyz Republic is 4.7 members per
household. However when considering MBPF recipient households, the average household
size increases to 5.9 members. The composition of the average MBPF recipient household
comprises 2.7 adults (18 years old or older) including 2.5 working age adults (18-62 years
old), and 3.2 children below 16 years old. Only few children under 6 years old attend nursery
school (Table A-5 & Table A-6, Annex A).

4.6      Comparing MBPF households to non-beneficiary households, MBPF households
tend to have a higher dependency ratio. According to the estimates presented in Figure 4.4,
only about 5 percent of MBPF beneficiaries live in households with one child, 22 percent live
in households with two children and 73 percent include households with three or more
children. These numbers outweigh the share of households with multiple children in the non-
beneficiary population of Kyrgyz Republic: 22 percent live in households without children,
27 percent in households with one child, 29 percent in households with two children, and 22
percent in households with three or more children. The number of dependents per able-bodied
adult in MBPF beneficiary households (1.4) is clearly higher when compared to poor non-
beneficiaries (0.8) or the total population (0.7) (Table A-5, Annex A). Fifty-five percent of
total MBPF beneficiaries live in households with a dependency ratio7 above one, which means
that the number of elderly and children exceeds the number of able-bodied adults. In poorer
non-beneficiary households, this share is 20 percent (Figure 4.5). Only 2.4 percent of the
beneficiaries live in households with a disabled member. For non-beneficiaries, this share is
1.2 percent for those that belong to the bottom 40 percent, and 0.6 percent for those that belong
to the top 60 percent (Table A-5 & Table A-6, Annex A).

4.7    The share of individuals living in households with household heads with higher
education is the lowest among MBPF beneficiaries. According to Figure 4.6, for the poorest
40 percent non-beneficiaries 8.7 percent live in households in which the household heads have

7 Number of dependents (children and elderly) per able-bodied adult, considering only households with at
least one able-bodied adult.

a higher education degree, while for the richer part this share reaches 20.2 percent. For MBPF
beneficiaries only 3.9 percent live in households in which the household head has completed
higher education. Having completed general secondary education is the most common level
of educational attainment in the Kyrgyz Republic. Among MBPF beneficiary households, it
concerns 90 percent of individuals that live in a household where the head has completed
general secondary school. The proportion of individuals living in households in which the
household head has only completed primary school is the lowest among MPBF beneficiaries
when compared to other households.

4.8     The comparison of the labor market status of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries
will focus on the group of people which could be expected to be economically active and
have children. Therefore, the able-bodied working age population (aged 18-62 years old),
excluding fulltime students, living in households with children under 18 years old is used as
reference group for the subsequent analysis, unless indicated otherwise. The analysis in this
section will use quarterly data for 2012, as seasonal effects are likely to have an impact on
labor force participation throughout the various seasons. Therefore, the labor market analysis
is based on data collected for each quarter of 2012.

4.9     Labor force participation refers to the proportion of the working age population
that is economically active: all individuals who supply labor for the production of goods
and services, or are ready to work. In assessing the impact of cash transfers on work
disincentives, it is important to analyze labor force participation by its aggregated measure,
economically active individuals. However, it is also necessary to analyze its components:
employed and unemployed individuals, people who are actively looking for work.

4.10 Seasonal differences in labor force participation are more pronounced for MBPF
beneficiaries compared to other poor non-beneficiaries. Table A-8 (upper panel) in Annex
A, presents quarterly labor force participation rates for adults aged 18 and older. In the first
quarter (Q1), 69.3 percent of adults aged 18 years or older in beneficiary households are
economically active. In the second (Q2) and third (Q3) quarter the share increases to 73
percent, after which it decreases to 69.2 percent in the fourth quarter (Q4). The higher level
of activity in the second and in the third quarters and given that the majority of beneficiaries
lives in rural areas suggests that beneficiaries are more likely to be involved in agricultural
activities than non-beneficiaries. Compared to non-beneficiaries, MBPF beneficiaries have
higher labor force participation rates when the elderly are included in the analysis. The largest
difference is between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries from the bottom 40 percent of the
per capita consumption distribution in the third quarter (7.5 percentage points difference).
When the elderly are not included in the analysis (Table A-8, lower panel, Annex A), the
largest difference is 2.9 percentage points, also in the third quarter.

4.11 Labor force participation rates are higher for able-bodied adults, aged 18-62 years
old, excluding fulltime students, and living in households with children. They range
between 77.7 and 79.5 percent over the year. In the first quarter, 74.3 percent of able-bodied
beneficiaries aged 18 to 62 years old are economically active. During the second and the third
quarters, in which agricultural activities are more likely to happen, this share increases to 78.5
percent and further to 79.2 percent, after which it decreases to 75.2 percent in the fourth
quarter. MBPF beneficiaries have higher participation rates compared to poor non-


                                               25
beneficiaries. When compared to non-beneficiaries belonging to the richest 60 percent,
beneficiaries have lower participation rates throughout the year. However, for the second and
the third quarters, the difference between these groups decreases by half, from 6 to 3
percentage points. Unemployment rates in 2012 started at a relatively high 9.4 percent in the
first quarter and declined to 5.3 percent at the end of the year. This reflects the overall
economic situation in the Kyrgyz Republic. The economy only picked up speed in the second
half of 2012 and 2013. MBPF beneficiaries were particularly hard hit with unemployment in
the first quarter of 2012 compared to the rest of the population (16.4 percent compared to 9.9
and 8.1 percent for poor and non-poor non-beneficiaries). However, in the second half of
2012, unemployment rates for beneficiaries were slightly lower than for the others.

4.12 Household heads are more active in the labor market than other adult household
members and they are less affected by seasonal variations. Figure 4.7 shows that
household heads have a higher participation rate in the labor market than spouses and other
relatives. While household heads’ rates remain above 80 percent throughout the year, the
rate for spouses varies from 64.1 percent (Q1) to 75.8 percent (Q3) and the rate for other
relatives varies from 70.1 (Q4) to 76.3 (Q2). Compared to poor non-beneficiaries,
household heads from MBPF recipient households tend to have slightly lower participation
rates, but their spouses have higher activity rates. Overall, participation rates of spouses in
poor households are clearly lower than in households belonging to the top 60 percent of
the welfare distribution (Table A-9, Annex A).

4.13 Considering employed MBPF beneficiaries the share of individuals with higher
degrees of education is the lowest among MBPF beneficiaries. According to Figure 4.8, for
the poorest 40 percent non-beneficiaries 9.7 percent have higher degree of education, while
for the richest this share reaches 24 percent. For MBPF beneficiaries 5.9 percent of MBPF
beneficiaries have higher degree of education. The level of education with the highest share
is general secondary or incomplete higher degree among all groups, being the MBPF
beneficiaries the group with the highest with 91.8 percent. The proportion of individuals with
primary or incomplete secondary degree is the lowest among beneficiaries, 2.3 percent.

4.14 MBPF beneficiaries are more likely to be engaged in economic activities
involving farm labor as peasants compared to non-beneficiaries. As the Labor Force
Survey from 2012 suggests, this represents 48.6 percent of total beneficiaries who can be
expected to work in the first quarter, and 45.2 percent in the third quarter (see Figure 4.9). In
the first quarter, 28.5 percent of the beneficiaries are wageworkers for individuals, 13 percent
are self-employed, and 11 percent of are employed at firms, institutions or collective farms.
During the third quarter, the distribution of total beneficiaries by main economic activity
does not change drastically. Among beneficiaries, the largest difference is for the share of
wageworkers, which increases by 7 percentage points. Given that wages in the informal
agricultural sector are very low, it seems reasonable to assume that income from work in
these households is relatively low. The distribution of non-beneficiaries across the main
economic activities differs when compared to beneficiaries. For non-beneficiaries
belonging to the poorest 40 percent, 28 percent work at firms, institutions or collective farms
during the first quarter, followed by wage workers for individuals (24 percent), farm peasants
(23 percent) and self-employed (23 percent). Among non-beneficiaries from the top 60
percent, in the first quarter, 45 percent are employed at firms, institutions or collective farms,
followed by self-employed (18 percent), and wage work for individuals (16.8 percent). Only
15.4 percent of this group works as farm peasants. During the third, the distribution of total
non-beneficiaries by main economic activity does not present significant changes.

4.15 MBPF beneficiaries are more likely to be engaged in informal activities compared
to non-beneficiaries. Informal economic activities appear to be less common among non-
beneficiaries with a higher level of consumption. Among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries,
the share of informal activities is highest during the third quarter: 61 percent of beneficiaries
are engaged in informal work. For non-beneficiaries with lower level of consumption this
percentage is 52, while for non-beneficiaries with higher level of consumption the share is 34
percent.

4.16 MBPF beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries with higher levels of per capita
consumption have a higher likelihood to work on a plot, in a forest or other own production


                                                29
than non-beneficiaries with lower level of consumption. Throughout the year, the share of
beneficiaries who declared to be involved in working on their own plot, in the forest or other
own production activities varies considerably. During the first quarter, 33.4 percent of total
economically active beneficiaries have declared to be engaged in working on their own plot,
in the forest or other own production activities. This share increases to 40.3 percent during the
second quarter, when particularly unemployed beneficiaries are engaged in working on their
own plots. As MBPF beneficiaries are primarily engaged in agricultural activities, it is not
surprising that the share of this group working on a plot, in a forest or on own production is
higher compared to the two other groups. Working on a plot, in a forest or on own production
is an important activity for unemployed beneficiaries, particularly in the second, when the
share of individuals involved in this type of activity reaches 55.4 percent of total unemployed
beneficiaries (Figure 4.11).
4.17 MBPF beneficiaries living in rural areas have higher labor force participation rates
compared to non-beneficiaries in rural areas and to beneficiaries in urban areas. This holds
for all four quarters (Figure 4.12). In the urban areas, the participation rate varies between
35.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 40.7 percent in the second quarter, in the rural areas it
varies from 81.4 percent in the first quarter to 87.2 percent in the third quarter. Compared to
non-beneficiaries, the labor force participation of able-adult beneficiaries living in rural areas
is slightly higher. However, in urban areas MBPF beneficiaries are significantly less likely to
be active. Their participation rates remains within the 30-40 percent interval, which is about
half of the participation rates for the other groups. Seasonal employment seems to have a
higher impact on the participation rate of beneficiaries living in rural areas: in the urban areas,
the share of employed beneficiaries varies from 32.2 percent in the first quarter to 35.9 percent
in the second quarter, in the rural areas it varies from 62.7 percent in the first quarter to 82.8
percent in the third quarter (Figure 4.13).
4.18 MBPF beneficiaries living in the North have lower labor force participation rates
compared to non-beneficiaries and to beneficiaries in the South. This also holds for all four
quarters (Figure 4.12). In the Southern oblasts, the activity rate varies from 76.5 percent in
the first quarter to 80.7 percent in the second and third quarters, while in the Northern oblasts
it varies from 65.7 in the first quarter to 72.8 in the third quarter. The labor force participation
of MBPF beneficiaries living in the South is slightly higher when compared to non-
beneficiaries. Beneficiaries living in the North are less likely to be active. Seasonal
employment appears to have a higher influence on the participation rate of able-adult
beneficiaries living in the South: in the Northern oblasts, the share of employed beneficiaries
varies from 53.2 percent in the fourth quarter to 62 percent in the second quarter, in the South
it varies from 58.6 percent in the first quarter to 78.2 percent in the third quarter (Figure 4.13).
The trend for MBPF beneficiaries living in rural areas is similar to the South. This can be
explained by the high share of rural population in the Southern oblasts: 83 percent of total
MBPF beneficiaries that live in the South are living in rural areas (compared to 56 percent in
the North). However, during the third quarter, when agriculture activities are expected to be
higher, a higher share of MBPF beneficiaries from the North have been engaged in farm
activities, 54.9 percent against 43.3 percent for beneficiaries living in the south oblasts. When
compared to MBPF beneficiaries living in south oblasts, those living in north oblasts are less
likely to be employed at firms, institutions or collective farms, but more likely to be self-
employed and wage workers. MBPF beneficiaries living in the north oblasts are also more


                                                30
likely to be engaged in informal economic activities than those living in south oblasts (Table
A-17, Annex A).

4.19 As can be expected, seasonal effects are more pronounced for people employed in
the farming sector, while non-farm employment may be more responsive to overall
economic volatility. The employment rate for beneficiaries in the non-farm sector increased
from 41.9 percent in the first quarter to 53.1 percent in the fourth quarter. For the poorer non-
beneficiaries, the employment rate started the year at 71.5 percent, decreasing to 66 percent
during the second and third quarters, and going back up to 70.5 percent. For the richer non-
beneficiaries the employment rate remained stable. In the farm sector, the employment rate
for beneficiaries oscillated between 46.9 percent and 58.1 percent. Seasonal effects have a
stronger impact for the poor working in the farm sector, than for the non-poor (Figure 4.14).

4.20 Similar to MBPF cash transfers, money from relatives plays an important role in
the household budget of MBPF beneficiaries and as such could lead to work disincentives.


                                                33
As indicated above, for the 19.6 percent of all MBPF beneficiaries that receives remittances,
this transfer accounts for 52.3 percent of total household income. Within this 19.6 percent, the
level of activity varies over the year. Activity rates are slightly lower during the winter months,
and among MBPF recipients with remittances they are lower than compared to the other
groups (Figure 4.15). The same pattern is verified for MBPF beneficiaries that receive
remittances and live in the South. However, for the 3.7 percent of MBPF beneficiaries in the
North that receive remittances, activities rates are higher than non-beneficiaries when and they
live in the north oblasts (97.4 percent) (Table A-17, Annex A).

4.21 Housekeeping and childcare are the main occupations for inactive MBPF
beneficiaries. According to the social status of the respondents presented in Figure 4.16,
the main occupation for inactive MBPF beneficiaries is housekeeping and taking care of
children, followed by retirement due to old age, and retirement due to disability. Inactivity
due to housekeeping and taking care of children is also the most important reason for non-
beneficiaries, though less pronounced. Retirement as reason for inactivity score higher among
non-beneficiaries. This pattern is also observed among MBPF beneficiaries living in south or
north oblasts (Table A-17, Annex A).

5. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATION OF WORK DISINCENTIVES
5.1      The analysis in this section empirically assesses the existence of adverse incentives
for labor force participation for MBPF beneficiaries at the individual and at the household
level. In the previous section, the profiles of MBPF beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries have
been compared with respect to different demographic and labor force participation indicators.
In order to understand whether certain characteristics are more likely to induce the presence
or absence from the labor market, different econometric models will be applied.

5.2      As a first step, we apply simple binary models to test whether able-bodied adults
living in MBPF beneficiaries are more or less likely to participate in the labor market. The
analysis focuses on four different outcomes: (i) active labor market participation, (ii)
employment (NSC definition), (iii) extended employment (including unpaid work), and (iv)
participation in informal work (including unpaid work). The results will indicate which
individual or household characteristics are positively or negatively correlated with labor
market outcomes and to what extent seasonal influences matter. For the latter purpose, the
models are estimated for quarter 1 (winter) and quarter 3 (summer). In the binary (probit)
model, the probability of an individual to be active or to be employed is assumed to be a
function of: MBPF beneficiary status; gender; age; level of educational attainment; status for
residing in south oblasts, rural and mountainous areas. The models further include household
size; number of children under six years old in the household; number of children between 6
and 18 years old in the household; and whether a household receives remittances from
relatives and work abroad. The first three models are estimated for all individuals in the
sample (able-bodied adults, 18-62 years old, excluding fulltime students, living in households
with children). The model for informal work is estimated only for the employed individuals
in the sample, including those engaged in unpaid work (extended definition of employment).
In addition, separate models are estimated for household heads and spouses, assuming that
their labor market decisions may differ. At last, the four models are estimated again, but this
time only including the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution. The tables below (Table
5.1, Table 5.2 and Table 5.3) summarize the results of selected key variables. The complete
results are reported in Annex B (Tables B-1 - B-8).

5.3     Overall, able-bodied adults living in households with children and receiving MBPF
transfers are neither less nor more likely to be active in the labor market. The result holds
across seasons and for different parts of the welfare distribution. Only household heads that
live in MBPF recipient households are less likely to be active in the labor market in the third
quarter if the analysis only includes the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution.

5.4     With respect to employment (NSC definition), MBPF beneficiaries are less likely to
be employed in the first quarter of the year. This result is most probably driven by the
significantly higher unemployment rate for MBPF beneficiaries in the first quarter of 2012
(Figure 4.7). The marginal effects are slightly larger for heads than for spouses. The effect
disappears when analyzing the third quarter. Using the extended definition of employment,
which includes unpaid work, the results remain largely the same, except that for spouses the
quarter does not matter at all. MBPF receipt has no effect on their likelihood to be employed
or engaged in unpaid work.



                                              37
5.5     Considering only able-bodied adults that are currently employed or engaged in
unpaid work, MBPF beneficiaries are 16 percentage points more likely to work in the
informal sector. The effects are particularly strong for the sample of spouses. Spouses in
MBPF households are between 30 and 52 percentage points more likely to be active in the
informal sector, while the effects for household heads are hardly significant. With 97 percent
of spouses being female, the results reflect gender-based preferences. One of the concerns
about targeted social assistance programs relates to the potential risk of such transfers to push
recipients into the informal sector (Tesliuc et al., 2014). While such effects have been found,
for example in countries of the Western Balkans (Gotcheva & Sundaram, 2013; Koettl &
Weber, 2012), it is not clear whether similar mechanisms explain the high likelihood of female
MBPF beneficiaries to work informally in the Kyrgyz Republic. Informal employment
accounts for 70 percent, which is significantly higher than in most countries in the Western
Balkan. The argument that particularly individuals with low levels of education and low skills
are pushed into informality (Koettl, 2013) does not hold either. Compared to individuals with
only completed primary education, incomplete general secondary or less, adults that
completed general secondary education or higher are neither less nor more likely to work in
the informal sector. Furthermore, the means test in the Kyrgyz Republic includes income from
all sources, whether formal or informal, and also accounts for potential income from land
ownership.

5.6     The place of residence is significant to explain labor force participation and
employment, however the significance level of the marginal effects are not consistent
throughout the samples. In general, individuals living in Southern oblasts are less likely to
be economically active and employed. But they are neither more nor less likely to be engaged
in informal work. Within the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution, marginal effects
are not statistically significant. Living in a rural area increases the likelihood of being active,
employed and being engaged in informal work, if all individuals in the sample and spouses
are considered. Residing in a mountainous area increases the likelihood of being economically
active and employed only for household heads during the third quarter, but it decreases the
probability of being engaged in informal in particular for household heads.

5.7      Income from remittances is negatively correlated with the probability of being
economically active and employed, particularly for spouses. In general, the size of the effect
is larger when considering only individuals belonging to the bottom 40 percent of the welfare
distribution. However, if the extended definition of employment is used, the effect of
remittances disappears for the bottom 40 percent of the distribution. It may be an indication
that spouses in poor households rather engage in unpaid work once the household receives
cash in the form of remittances. This is confirmed by the analysis of the effect of remittances
on informal work. Working spouses in poor households that receive remittances are between
22 (Q1) and 37 (Q3) percentage points more likely to be work informally.

5.8     The number of children in the household plays a significant role as determinant of
labor force participation, but with different effects for household heads and spouses. Given
that the size of the MBPF depends on the number of children in eligible households, the
presence of more children may result in negative work incentives. The analysis indicates that
the number of children indeed matters, but that the age of the children plays a role as well.
The number of children below the age of six reduces the likelihood of spouses to be active in

the labor market, irrespective of the specific outcome analyzed. On the other hand, an
increasing number of children aged 6 to 18 has a positive effect on the labor market
participation of household heads. Given that spouses are mainly female, inactivity may be a
deliberate choice in order to care for the small children. Assuming that the costs of having
school-aged children are higher, household heads need to work in order to support the family.
The effect of children on informal work only plays a role for household heads but does not
matter for spouses. With respect to other individual and/or household characteristics, men are
more likely to be economically active and employed, as are individuals with higher education.
Furthermore, the likelihood to be economically active and employed increases with age up to
a certain age, after which it decreases, but it plays no role in determining the probability of
working informally.

5.9     Given the limitations of the binary models to draw conclusions about the impact of
MBPF receipt on labor force participation, a quasi-experimental approach will be used
subsequently. Propensity Score Matching will be used to create a control group of non-
beneficiaries, which is as similar as possible compared to the MBPF beneficiaries. By
comparing the labor market behavior of these two groups, we will be able to analyze whether
or not the MBPF creates work disincentives. The Propensity Score Matching model is used
to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATT) of the treated (i.e. the MBPF beneficiaries)
on labor market outcomes.

    Box 2. Propensity Score Matching

    This study applies Propensity Score Matching to allow an adequate counterfactual to isolate the effects
    resulting from participation in the MBPF program. According to Khandker, Koolwal & Samad (2009, p.8),
    several approaches can be used to evaluate the effect of programs and estimate whether the changes in well-
    being and/or behavior result from the program intervention and not from other factors. In any impact
    evaluation method, creating a convincing and reasonable comparison group for beneficiaries is the main
    challenge. This challenge, also known as the counterfactual problem, can be approached by applying various
    methodologies for impact evaluations. The Propensity Score Matching is a common and very efficient method
    used to create an adequate control group.

    Propensity Score Matching matches individuals from the participant group with individuals from the
    nonparticipant group who share similar characteristics in order to ensure that the outcomes are compared with
    individuals that have similar probabilities of participating in the program. Variables that affect the likelihood
    of receiving a MBPF include age, household composition, living conditions and geographical region. The
    average treatment effect of the program is then calculated as the mean difference in outcomes between these
    two groups.

    The model is estimated to assess the existence of adverse incentives for labor force participation of MBPF
    beneficiaries. The propensity score matching model is estimated by Stata’s program teffects psmatch.




5.10 The econometric analysis on labor market outcomes of individuals living in
beneficiary households will be based on the group of people who could be expected to work.8
Therefore, the able-bodied working age population (aged 18-62 years old), not full time
students and living in households with children under 18 years old is used as reference group.
The model will be estimated for each quarter of 2012, as seasonal effects are likely to have an
impact on individuals’ labor market outcomes throughout the various seasons. In addition to
the quarterly analysis, the model will also consider the hypothesis that labor market outcomes
of MBPF beneficiaries might be different for different reference groups. Therefore, after
estimating the model based on the full sample of able-bodied working age population (aged
18-62 years old), not being full time students and living in households with children under 18
years old, and for household heads and spouses separately, the models will also be estimated
based on three different subsamples. The subsamples are derived from the reference group
described above, but focus on residents of rural areas, south and north oblasts. This
differentiation is necessary due to the hypothesis that the MBPF program might have different
impacts according to one’s status in the household or the particular location of a household.


8 Some studies, as Levin & Ersado (2011), exclude caretakers from the group of people who could be expected
to work. However, for the present analysis this action would reduce the sample size significantly for some of
the models used in section 4, which could compromise its feasibility and its statistical significance. Another
issue that does not allow for this exclusion is that the KIHS caretakers are aggregated to housekeepers, a
group that should not be excluded from the group of people who could be expected to work. To minimize the
effect of accounting caretakers as potential workers, the model considers the number of children in the
household as matching variable.

5.11 The Propensity Score Matching model considers individual, household head and
household characteristics to estimate the impact of receiving MBPF benefits on work
decisions of all the members of the household (at the individual level), the household head
and spouses (at the household level). The dependent variables used to estimate the first type
of model are economically active status; employed, employed extended definition (including
informal work) and annual per capita consumption, hours worked per week, wage per hour
and informal employment. Given that hours worked per week, wage per hour and informal
employment are measures based on people who are currently employed, the impact of
receiving MBPF benefits on these measures will be estimated based on a reduced sample in
which the matching will be done only among employed individuals. In these models, in which
the sample is restricted to employed individuals, the sample becomes very small for
estimations considering only household heads or only spouses and it loses representativeness.
Because of that, the impact of MBPF participation with the restricted sample for employed
individuals will be estimated only considering all members of the household. In all models, it
is assumed that work decisions are a function of individual and household characteristics. In
respect to individual characteristics, the model considers MBPF beneficiary status, age,
gender, relation to the household head and different types of education attainment9. For
household characteristics, the models consider household size, number of children under 6
years old in the household, number of children between 6 and 18 years old in the household,
household living conditions10, size of land11, durable assets12 and livestock ownership; and
household location13. The results are summarized in Table 5.4 and Table 5.5.

5.12 Participation in the MBPF program positively affects the likelihood of being
economically active during winter. During this period, the program’s effect is estimated at
1.1 percentage point (p.p.) for both, first and fourth quarters (Table B-9, Annex B). In the
second quarter, when agricultural production is expected to be higher, MBPF beneficiaries
are less likely to be economically active when compared to similar non-beneficiaries. The
effect of MBPF participation on the likelihood of being economically active is positive,
throughout the year, for those living in rural areas and in the South. As expected, MBPF
beneficiaries who live in rural areas have a higher probability to be economically active
throughout the year. In contrast, MBPF beneficiaries who live in the North are less likely to
be economically active when compared to similar non-beneficiaries. In the Northern oblasts,
the marginal effect of receiving the cash transfer on the probability of being economically
active decreases over the year from -13.6 p.p. in the first quarter, to -2.2 p.p. in the fourth
quarter (Table B-9, Annex B).

5.13 Household heads who are MBPF beneficiaries are less likely to be economically
active than similar non-beneficiaries throughout the year, on the other hand, spouses are
more likely to be economically active for most part of the year. The effect on household

heads of participating in the MBPF varies between -7.4 p.p. in the fourth quarter, to -12.7 p.p.
in the first quarter (Table B-10, Annex B). Participation in the MBPF program positively
affects the likelihood of a household head being economically active when considering
beneficiaries from rural areas, except during the third quarter. MBPF beneficiaries living in
the northern oblasts are also more likely to be economically active during the first and the
fourth quarters when compared to similar non-beneficiaries. For those living in the southern
oblasts, MBPF benefits contribute to higher probability of being economically active only
during the second quarter. For spouses, the effect of participating in the MBPF varies from -
5.8 p.p. in the first quarter, to a higher likelihood of participation of 4.6 p.p. in the fourth
quarter (Table B-11, Annex B). Participation in the MBPF program negatively affects the
likelihood of spouses being economically active in the northern oblasts.

5.14 The impact of MBPF participation on the probability of being employed is negative,
irrespective whether the narrow (NSC) or extended definition of employment is used. When
compared to similar non-beneficiaries, the probability of being employed for MBPF
beneficiaries ranges from -8.4 p.p. in the first quarter, to -2.6 p.p. in the third quarter (Table
B-9, Annex B). However, participation in the MBPF program positively affects the likelihood
of being employed when considering beneficiaries from rural areas and south oblasts,
particularly during the summer months. For household heads, the impact of MBPF benefits
on the probability of being employed remains negative, except for beneficiaries living in rural
areas or south oblasts during the second quarter. On the other hand, spouses that are MBPF
participants have a higher likelihood of being employed or engaged in unpaid work for most
of the quarters. The effect is particularly strong for spouses living in the southern oblasts
(Table 5.4).

5.15 The impact of the MBPF on annual per capita consumption is predominately
negative. This means that even after MBPF transfers, the recipients’ level of consumption is
still below the level of similar household. It confirms the earlier assessment that the adequacy
of the transfer is limited given its low share in total household consumption. According to
Table 5.4, notable exceptions to this conclusion relate to MBPF beneficiaries living in rural
areas, where the MBPF has a positive impact during the first and the third quarters; and for
those living in the north oblasts, where the MBPF has a positive impact during the fourth
quarter. For household heads and spouses, the participation effect of the MBPF on annual per
capita consumption remains negative, but during the second and third quarters. However, the
annual per capita consumption is likely to be higher for household heads who are MBPF
beneficiaries if they are living in rural areas, for all quarters, or if living in the South, for the
first and fourth quarters.

5.16 Among employed individuals, participation in the MBPF program negatively
affects the amount of hours worked during the second and third quarters, when
agricultural production are expected to be higher. During the winter, MBPF beneficiaries
appear to work more hours than similar non-beneficiaries (Table 5.5). This pattern might
suggest that MBPF beneficiaries suffer from under-employment during part of the year. As
discussed above, under-employment is mainly observed within poor households in rural areas.
Both characteristics are also observed among MBPF beneficiaries. According to Table 5.5,
underemployment is also observed for MBPF beneficiaries from rural areas for the first,



                                                 43
the second and the fourth quarters; for those living in the north for the first, the third and the
fourth quarters; and for those living in the south oblasts from the first to the third quarter.

5.17 Participation in the MBPF program negatively affects earnings measured by wage
per hour from employed individuals throughout the year. MBPF beneficiaries living in rural
areas, however, earn more than similar non-beneficiaries during the second and the third
quarters, as those living in the south oblasts in the second quarter (Table 5.5).

5.18 Participation in the MBPF program positively affects the probability of being
engaged in informal employment. The likelihood of being informally employed or own an
informal business is higher for MBPF beneficiaries when compared to similar non-
beneficiaries throughout the whole year. Table 5.5 suggests that the MBPF participation
effect is consistent among different quarters even when considering the different
subsamples: rural, north and south.

                                 6. CONCLUSIONS
6.1     The Monthly Benefit for Poor Families with Children (MBPF) is the only social
assistance transfer in the Kyrgyz Republic specifically targeted at extremely poor
households with children. It is a means-tested transfer whereby eligibility depends on average
formal and informal family income being below the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI).
Although the design of the MBPF implies a 100 percent marginal tax rate for every additional
Som earned above the GMI, the likelihood of potential work disincentives is limited
considering the low benefit levels. In 2012, MBPF benefits represent less than 30 percent of
the extreme poverty line; they are considerably below the official minimum wage and even
more to what adults can earn in the formal and informal sector. While social assistance
benefits can create labor market disincentives, this is mainly applicable in higher income
countries and when benefits are close to wages for low-paid jobs. In most countries in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, such concerns are not warranted given the low generosity (and
generally also low coverage) of social assistance benefits (Arias & Sanchez-Paramo, 2014).

6.2     Since 2010, the GoKG annually allocates about 0.5 percent of GDP to the MBPF,
which reflects 10 percent of total social protection expenditures. The program is
characterized by low coverage and limited adequacy, but the allocated transfers are
progressive. The majority of the beneficiaries live in rural and non-mountainous areas, and in
oblasts in the South of the country. The allocation of transfers across oblast is rather unequal.
Naryn and Osh are the oblasts with the highest benefit incidence. Jalal-Abad, the oblast with
the highest extreme poverty incidence and where most of the extremely poor live, has
relatively few MBPF beneficiaries. This indicates the possibility of regional patterns when
analyzing the labor market outcomes of MBPF beneficiaries.

6.3     Overall, the analysis in this report indicates that the MBPF does not create
disincentives for labor force participation for those living in rural areas or Southern
oblasts, but it might be an issue for beneficiaries living in the North. Seasonal effects have
a significant impact on labor force participation. This is closely related to the fact that MBPF
beneficiaries predominantly live in rural areas and are engaged in farming activities, which
are rather seasonal. Inactive MBPF recipients are mainly engaged with housekeeping and
childcare. When analyzing the whole sample, the effect of MBPF participation changes
according to the quarter in focus. According to the descriptive analysis, household heads in
MBPF households have higher activity rates when compared to spouses and other members
of the household. This pattern is confirmed in the subsequent analysis for household heads,
but the effect varies across quarter and per location. However, for spouses, the effect is
positive throughout the year, except for those living in the North.

6.4     For employed able-bodied adults, benefit receipt negatively affects the amount of
hours worked. This supports the finding that the problem in rural area is rather ‘under-
employment’ than unemployment (Schwegler & Rohmeis, 2013). This is similar to the
findings in Armenia (Levin & Ersado, 2011). Not only does the MBPF have a negative impact
on the hours worked, beneficiaries also earn less wage per hour compared to similar employed
non-beneficiaries. MBPF receipt also increases the likelihood that employment is in the

                                               47
informal sector. This is not surprising given that 70 percent of employment in the country is
in the informal sector. Finally, the analysis in this report also showed, that the MBPF has no
clear positive effect on annual consumption per capita comparing MBPF beneficiaries with
households with similar characteristics.

6.5     Regional and seasonal effects on labor market outcomes should be further
investigated. The analysis in this report indicates that the labor market in the Kyrgyz Republic
follows a seasonal pattern with more work opportunities during the summer months. This has
implications for able-bodied individuals looking for work. Despite high levels of labor market
participation both among MBPF beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, making ends meet
remains difficult for many household given the low wages in the agricultural sector, where
most of the poor in rural areas are engaged. Regional differences across oblasts, but
particularly between the North and South are relatively pronounced.
