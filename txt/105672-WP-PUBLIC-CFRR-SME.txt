    Overview

    This report gives an overview of the key results from the analysis of the data collected in a survey conducted in
    October and November 2012 by the Austrian Institute for SME Research on behalf of the World Bank Centre
    for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR).

    The survey was carried out using an online questionnaire and captures data from more than 780 small and
    medium-sized enterprises that are representative of the Austrian SME sector.

    The primary purpose of this report is to assist the accounting and auditing profession, policy makers, and users
    of financial information in understanding the value and the constraints of SMEs’ financial reporting practices. It
    also feeds into a broader CFRR study on Corporate Financial Reporting Reform in Austria.

    The report presents the results of the survey grouped by topical areas as follows:

             Accounting Practices in Austrian SMEs
             Auditing Financial Statements
             SME Financing
             Financial Reporting and Access to Finance

    Key results are summarized below.

         SMEs use financial statements to improve financial management and to secure access to finance
    Austrian SMEs are required by law to draw up financial statements. 63% of Austrian SMEs use their financial
    statements often or very often, and they consider financial reporting useful to improve the financial
    management of their business. Half of Austrian SMEs use their financial statements often or very often to
    secure supplier credit or a bank loan.

        Austrian SMEs face some challenges in relation to their accounting obligations
    More than half of Austrian SMEs consider the complexity of accounting requirements (58%) and the time
    required for preparing accounting and financial reports (57%) as very or rather high. The cost of compliance
    with accounting requirements is regarded as (very or rather) high by 56% of SMEs.

        Most SMEs outsource the preparation of financial statements to specialist service providers
    Almost three-quarters of all Austrian SMEs outsource all the preparation of their financial statements to
    specialist service providers. SMEs are generally very satisfied with the services provided by these specialist
    firms. Only 8% of SMEs prepare their financial statements in-house (i.e., without an external service provider)
    and more than half of these benefits from the advice of their local business association and professional
    organizations for public accountants and tax advisers.

         Austrian SMEs see value in having audited financial statements beyond the legal compliance aspect
    In Austria, only corporations (”AG”) or limited liability companies (LLCs, or “GmbH”) are legally required to
    have their financial statements audited (partnerships and other forms are not). The majority of LLCs
    participating in the survey see value in having their financial statements audited. Indeed, they consider that
    audits (i) enhance the credibility of their financial statements (56% of participating LLCs), and (ii) strengthen
    their internal controls (51%).

        Banks are the single most prominent source of financing for Austrian SMEs
    Banks are the most common source of investment-financing for SMEs. More than two-thirds (67%) of Austrian
    SMEs with investment requirements in the past 3 years used bank financing to meet their needs.

         SMEs perceive an increase in banks’ documentation requirements when drawing a credit
    Most Austrian SMEs that have received bank financing for their investments over the past 3 years consider
    that banks’ documentation requirements became much (30%) or slightly (28%) tougher during this period.


    The analysis of the data collected in the Survey on Small and Medium Enterprise Financial Reporting suggests
    that financial statements, both audited and unaudited, play a valued role for SMEs; not only for tax purposes,
    but also in helping SMEs improve the financial management of their businesses and facilitate their access to
    bank financing.

    The findings that the majority of SMEs encounters challenges in complying with accounting requirements and
    that most SMEs outsource the preparation of their financial statements to specialist service providers suggest
    that SMEs’ potential use of financial reporting in Austria is very much dependent on:

        (i) a system that strikes the appropriate balance between promoting improved financial information and
        lessening the regulatory burden.

        (ii) the accounting and auditing profession’s capacity to provide reasonable assurance regarding the data
        accuracy of the financial information provided in a SME credit application.

    Preparing financial statements requires efforts and resources and, as might be expected, a number of SMEs
    find bookkeeping and reporting obligations costly. At the same time, SMEs are generally satisfied with the
    services provided by external service providers.

    1          Accounting practices in Austrian SMEs

    1.1        Accounting systems

    Two-thirds of Austrian SMEs apply double-entry accounting. A third of SMEs prepare their accounts on a cash-
    basis only. As might be expected from the legal framework, which requires larger SMEs to apply double-entry
    bookkeeping, the share of enterprises with double-entry accounting increases as the size of enterprise
    increases.

    Figure 1       Accounting system, by number of employees, Austrian SMEs, 2012

    However, many enterprises that are not obliged to apply double-entry accounting do so voluntarily. For
    example, nearly half of SMEs with an annual turnover between EUR 100,000 and EUR 250,000 apply double-
    entry accounting, even though SMEs are currently only required to do so once their annual turnover exceeds
    EUR 700,000.

                                                                  6

    1.2          Other documentation

    In addition to annual accounts, 62% of Austrian SMEs prepare a budget plan for the next year or years. 51%
    prepare a finance plan and a cash-flow outlook, 43% prepare a corporate strategic plan. Larger SMEs are more
    likely to prepare such additional documentation than smaller SMEs.

    1.3          Reasons for preparing financial statements

    All Austrian enterprises are required for tax purposes to prepare an income statement or (for larger firms)
                                                              3
    both a balance sheet and a profit and loss account. However, Austrian SMEs also use these financial
    statements for other purposes. 63% of SMEs use their financial statements (very) often for the financial
    control of their business and 47% of SMEs use them to assist in obtaining supplier credits or bank loans. The
    use of financial statements to secure supplier credits or bank loans is more frequent in those enterprises that
    outsource the preparation of their financial statements to an external service provider (49%) than it is in those
    enterprises that prepare them in-house (41%). However, only 4% of SMEs (very) often use their financial
    statements to help attract new equity investment in the firm.

        In the following these documents are referred to as “financial statements”.

    Larger SMEs are more likely to use their financial statements for other reasons than tax purposes. While only
    42 % of companies with fewer than 5 employees use their financial statements for securing credits or loans,
    83 % of medium-sized companies (with 50 to 249 employees) do so.


    1.4        Outsourcing of the preparation of financial statements

    Almost three-quarters of Austrian SMEs outsource the preparation of their financial statements. 19% of SMEs
    prepare financial statements in cooperation with external service providers and only 8% of SMEs produce their
    financial statements in the enterprise (without an external service provider). Smaller companies are more
    likely to outsource the preparation of financial statements than larger ones; conversely, larger SMEs are more
    likely to prepare financial statements in-house (without using an external service provider) than are smaller
    ones.

    Enterprises with an annual turnover of € 10 million and more are most likely to prepare financial statements
    in-house (39% of such firms do so). However, 19 % of very small companies with an annual turnover of less
    than € 50,000 also prepare their financial statements in-house. Most of these very small companies (73%)
    prepare income statements only.

    1.5        External service providers

    The most important factor for Austrian SMEs in selecting an external service provider to prepare their financial
    statements is personal contact (very or rather important for 72% of those SMEs who use the services of
    external providers), followed by recommendations from other enterprises (important for 63%). For 59% of
    such SMEs the reputation of the service provider is very or rather important.

                     financial statements in cooperation with external service providers or outsource their
                     preparation to external service providers, 2012




          Source: Austrian Institute for SME Research, online survey October/November 2012 (n between 480 and 633 depending on category)


    Most Austrian SMEs using external service providers in the field of financial reporting (90%) are (very) satisfied
    with the quality of the services that they receive. 82% of such SMEs consider the advice given by their
    professional service providers to be (very) satisfactory, 77% are also (very) satisfied with the time-efficiency of
    the services provided. Even the costs are regarded as (very) satisfactory by 58% of the SMEs buying such
    services.

                     financial statements in cooperation with external service providers or outsource their
                     preparation to external service providers, 2012




          Source: Austrian Institute for SME Research, online survey October/November 2012 (n between 670 and 673 depending on category)

    In addition to preparing financial statements, filing tax returns is the most prominent service for which SMEs
    hire external service providers. 94 % of Austrian SMEs do so.

                                                                     9

    1.6        Complying with accounting requirements

    57 % of Austrian SMEs consider the complexity of accounting requirements and the time required for
    preparing accounting and financial reports to be either very or rather high. The availability of expertise to
    assist a company to carry out accounting is considered as rather low or very low by 58 % of Austrian SMEs. The
    cost of compliance with accounting requirements is regarded as (very or rather) high by 56 %.

          Source: Austrian Institute for SME Research, online survey October/November 2012 (n between 703 and 761 depending on category)

    Especially among start-up enterprises, the costs of compliance with accounting requirements are perceived as
    very high.

    Figure 10        Austrian SMEs’ assessment of the cost of complying with accounting requirements, by stage of
                     enterprise’s development, 2012

    In particular, those companies that carry out their accounting without using an external service provider view
    the cost and complexity of accounting requirements as being significantly lower than do SMEs in general. Such
    SMEs also report more serious constraints in getting access to assisting expertise than do SMEs in general
    (63 % of such SMEs report that the availability external expertise is rather or very low, compared to 58 % for
    SMEs as a whole).

           Source: Austrian Institute for SME Research, online survey October/November 2012 (n between 61 and 66 depending on category)


    The median Austrian SME that has not fully outsourced its accounting (27% of all SMEs) spends approximately
    5 person-days per month on meeting the enterprise’s accounting requirements. Initially, the number of
    person-days that are dedicated to accounting within a company increases as the size of the enterprise rises.
    However, medium-sized enterprises (50-249 employees) dedicate fewer person-days within the firm to
    accounting duties than do companies with 20-49 employees, as external service providers are increasingly
    engaged for preparing the accounts and financial statements.

    1.7      Sources of information and advice

    More than half (52%) of those SMEs which prepare financial statements without help from an external service
    provider receive information and advice regarding financial requirements including accounting and tax rules
    from professional or branch bodies. Nearly half use specialist software applications as a source of such
    information and a third obtains information from official websites.

        Many SMEs voluntarily maintain double entry accounting
    Double-entry accounting is very common in Austria even in SMEs that are not legally required do keep double-
    entry accounts. Two-thirds (67%) of all SMEs prepare a balance sheet and a profit and loss account.

         Financial statements are often used to improve financial controls and to secure access to finance
    Austrian SMEs are required to draw up financial statements for tax purposes. 63% of Austrian SMEs also use
    their financial statements (very) often to improve the financial control of their business and just under half of
    Austrian SMEs (47%) use their financial statements (very) often to secure supplier credits or bank loans.

         Most SMEs outsource the preparation of financial statements to external service providers
    Almost three-quarters (73%) of all SMEs outsource all the preparation of financial statements to external
    service providers.

        Most SMEs are satisfied with the services of external service providers
    90% of all SMEs that make use of external service providers for preparing their financial statements consider
    the quality of the services received as (very) good. More than three-quarters are also (very) satisfied regarding
    the advice given (82%) and the time efficiency (77%) of these service providers. Their costs are regarded as
    (very) satisfactory by 58% of SMEs using their services. In addition to preparing financial statements, filing tax
    returns is the most prominent service for which SMEs hire external service providers. 94% of Austrian SMEs do
    so.

         SMEs encounter challenges in accounting
    More than half (58%) of Austrian SMEs consider accounting requirements as complex. Moreover, most SMEs
    consider the time required for preparing accounting and financial reports (57%) and the costs of complying
    with accounting requirements (56%) to be high or very high. The availability of expertise to assist the company
    in accounting is considered to be rather or very low by more than half (58%) of SMEs.

        Legal interest representations are the main source of information for self-preparers
    More than half of Austrian SMEs which prepare financial statements without help from an external service
    provider receive information and advice regarding financial reporting requirements from their local business
    association and professional organizations for public accountants and tax advisers.

    2          Auditing financial statements

    2.1        Introduction
                                                                        4
    In Austrian law only so called Kapitalgesellschaften can have a legal obligation to have their financial
    statements audited. If two of the following thresholds are exceeded, auditing becomes obligatory for a
    Kapitalgesellschaft:

              turnover € 9.68 million
              balance sheet total: € 4.84 million
              average number of employees: 50

    As issues surrounding auditing are only relevant to SMEs with the legal form of a Kapitalgesellschaft, the
    discussion in this section is restricted to SMEs with this legal form. This restriction reduces the total number of
    survey participants from 786 to 342.


    2.2        Auditing financial statements

    30% of Austrian SMEs that participated in the survey and have the legal form of a Limited Liability Company
    (LLC) engage an auditor for checking their accounts. This proportion increases with the size of the enterprise.
    In medium-sized enterprises (with 50 to 249 employees), 63% of have their accounts checked by an auditor.

    Almost two-thirds of LLCs that have their financial statements audited do this because they are legally required
    to. Consequently 35% stated that they have voluntarily chosen to have an audit. This percentage is significantly
    higher than practitioners' perceptions on the basis of the authors’ semi -structured interviews.

    The most important impact-factor in the decision process for selecting an auditor is the reputation of the
    auditor (69% of LLCs consider it as very/rather important), followed by recommendations from other
    enterprises (60%) and personal contact (54%).

      Kapitalgesellschaften have their own legal personality and include joint stock corporations (Aktiengesellschaften) and limited liability
    companies (Gesellschaften mit beschraenkter Haftung). The Kapitalgesellschaft is the owner of the enterprise and the sole debtor to its
    shareholders.

    87% of LLCs that voluntarily commission audits state that the auditing process helps them to strengthen their
    internal controls. Nearly three-quarters of such firms believe that the audit enhances the credibility of their
    financial statements, while 65% believe that audited financial statements assist them in dealing with suppliers,
    financial institutions or the tax authorities.

    55% of LLCs with a legal obligation for auditing would potentially consider engaging an auditor also in the
    absence of such an obligation. For these firms too the two most important reasons for carrying out an audit
    are to enhance the credibility of the annual accounts and to strengthen internal controls.

    2.3      Key Results

        The auditor’s reputation is the most important factor in choosing an auditor
    The most important factor in an SME’s decision process for selecting an auditor is the reputation of the
    auditor. 69% of enterprises consider it as very/rather important.

         Austrian SMEs see many benefits in having their financial statements audited
    87% of those corporations that voluntarily choose to have their financial statements audited see the audit as
    help to strengthen their internal control system. In addition, 74% of such firms believe that the audit enhances
    the credibility of their financial statements, while 65% see the audit as being useful in dealing with suppliers,
    financial institutions or the tax authorities. Those corporations that are legally obliged to commission an audit
    but which would also engage an auditor without this obligation also see these three factors as being the most
    important benefits of the audit.

         Auditors do not often provide non-audit services to their clients
    Only 14% of Austrian SMEs with the legal form of a LLC commission non-audit services from the auditor. 87%
    of these enterprises use the auditor for tax advice and/or the preparation of tax returns.

    3            SME financing
    77% of all SMEs had investment requirements in the last three years. 39% of them had long term (more than 3
    years) investment requirements, another 39% medium term (1 to 3 years) requirements, and 38% had short
                                                       5

    Investment requirements increase with the size of the enterprise. 27% of SMEs with less than 5 employees
    reported no investment requirements but only 5% of medium-sized enterprises (with 50 to 249 employees)
    did so. All start-up enterprises have had investment requirements over the last 3 years. Compared to other
    stages of business development, SMEs in the growth phase have the highest investment needs (85% of firms in
    the growth phase reported investment requirements).

    Bank financing is the most common source of financing to meet SMEs’ investment requirements in Austria.
    Two-thirds of Austrian SMEs which had investment requirements over the last three years used bank financing
    to meet these requirements. 46% of all SMEs with investment requirements used retained profits. 27% use
    leasing, 7% supplier credits and 6% state subsidized financing support. Equity financing, factoring and
    mezzanine capital were hardly ever used (less than 1%).

    Bank financing becomes more important for longer-term investments. While 60% of Austrian SMEs met their
    short-term requirements with bank financing, 78% did used bank finance for long-term requirements. Self-
    financing (from retained profits) has a bigger role in short- and medium-term investments than in long-term
    investments: around 55% of Austrian SMEs with short- or medium-term investment requirements used
    retained profits but 38% of SMEs with long-term requirements did so.

    Most SMEs that met their investment requirements at least partly with bank financing hold bank accounts with
    one bank only (57% of such enterprises). 33 % of such SMEs work with 2 banks and the remaining 10% hold
    accounts in 3 or more banks.

    4        Financial reporting and access to finance

    4.1      Banks’ documentation requirements

    Most SMEs that used bank financing to finance at some of their investment requirements over the last 3 years
    believe that bank requirements concerning the provision of financial information and strategies have become
    tougher. 30% of such SMEs state that bank requirements became much tougher, 28% that they became only a
    little tougher, while 35% say that bank requirements stayed the same. Just 7% of such SMEs report that banks
    relaxed their information requirements.

                   in the last 3 years, Austrian SMEs that had investment requirements in the last 3 years and
                   met them (at least partly) with bank financing (52% of all SMEs), 2012

    The most striking changes are reported from SMEs where the business was in a consolidation/shrinking phase:
    57% of such firms stated that bank requirements had become much tougher and a further 18% reported that
    they have had become a little tougher.

    Those firms that report more financial information are less likely to report that bank information requirements
    have become tougher. Thus, while 34% of SMEs that only producing income statements say that bank
    requirements have become much tougher, the comparable figure for SMEs that prepare both balance sheets
    and profit and loss accounts report is 28%. LLCs that have their financial statements audited, also encounter
    fewer challenges. While 64% of SMEs that do not have their financial statements audited perceive that the
    banks’ documentation requirements have become tougher over the past three years, only 53% of those who
    have their financial statements audited do so.

    The most important information which had to be provided to the banks when applying for a credit in the last
    three years was the balance sheet plus the income statement or the profit and loss account. 95% of Austrian
    SMEs stated that these documents were required. Banks also frequently requested personal information about
    the firm’s owner and information on the firm’s liabilities (both were required from 41% of SMEs that financed
    their investment requirements at least partly with bank financing).

    Information on accounts receivable was much more important for short-term financing (required for 50% of
    SMEs with bank financing of investment requirement) than for long-term financing (27%).

    believe that bank requirements concerning the provision of financial information and strategies have
    increased. SMEs that prepare more detailed financial statements (e.g. balance sheets and not only income
    statements) and have their financial statements audited are less likely to see the banks as having increased
    their information requirements than are SMEs that prepare less detailed statements.

    statement, were most important information which had to be provided to banks when applying for a credit in

        Lack of security is the most common reason for credit applications being refused
    81% of Austrian SMEs that had credit applications refused in the last 3 years mentioned that this was because
    they did not provide sufficient security to the bank.

    Definition of an SME

    This report focuses on SMEs. According to an EU recommendation, the number of persons employed and
    either the level of turnover or the size of the balance sheet determine whether a company is a micro, small or
    medium-sized enterprise (together these make up the SME sector) or a large enterprise.

    These limits apply to autonomous companies only. This means that the company is not a partner or linked to

    Structure of the Austrian SME sector

    To describe the structure of the Austrian SME sector hereafter, the survey draws on data from the Structural
    Business Statistics (SBS) for 2010 issued by Statistics Austria. This is the most accurate information currently
    available, as the data for 2011 will be published at the end of June 2013. The data provide important indicators
    concerning structure, activities, employment, investment activities and performance of enterprises at the
    national and regional levels. They are grouped according to NACE Rev. 2. This is the current European
    statistical classification of economic activities used by Eurostat and all national European statistical institutions
    like Statistics Austria. NACE is the acronyme for “Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la
    Communauté Européenne“.

    The SBS data cover the market-oriented economy. This includes

             Mining and quarrying (Section B of NACE REV. 2),
             Manufacturing (Section C of NACE REV. 2),
             Electricity, gas, stream and air conditioning supply (Section D of NACE REV. 2),
             Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities (Section E of NACE REV. 2)
             Construction (Section F of NACE REV. 2)
             Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (Section G of NACE REV. 2)
             Transportation and Storage (Section H of NACE REV. 2)
             Accommodation and food service activities (Section I of NACE REV. 2)
             Information and Communication (Section J of NACE REV. 2)
             Financial and insurance activities (Section K of NACE REV. 2)
             Real estate activities (Section L of NACE REV. 2)
             Professional, scientific and technical activities (Section M of NACE REV. 2)
             Administrative and support service activities (Section N of NACE REV. 2)
             Repair of computers and personal and household goods (Division 95 of NACE REV. 2)

    Agriculture and forestry, public sector, education, human health and personal services (such as hairdressers,
    textile cleaners) are not included in the market-oriented sector.

    Statistics Austria is the provider of official statistics in Austria and compiles its figures in line with guidelines set
    by Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office. This guarantees the comparability of the figures in Structural Business
    Statistics with figures produced by other EU member states. In the SBS database SMEs are defined solely by
    the number of persons employed. This is because it is not possible to cross-reference the level of employment
    with level of turnover and no figures for balance sheet are collected in the SBS database.

    Financial situation of SMEs in Austria

    For analysing the financial situation of SMEs in Austria hereafter, the survey draws on data from the Balance
    Sheet Database of the Austrian Institute for SME Research which allows for intercompany comparisons/
    benchmarking by using management ratios, assets and liability structure, and the financial or the cost and
    performance structure at different levels. These levels include industry, industry group, economic sector,
    region or federal state level. Cross-section analyses and longitudinal (cohort) analyses are also possible. The
    database consists of about 84,000 anonymized annual accounts (double-entry accounting) for each year. For
                                              7
    SMEs in the market-oriented economy (see above for definition) approximately 70,000 annual accounts
                                                                                                       st
    (double-entry accounting) were analysed for the year 2010/11 (accounting date between July 1 , 2010 and
            th
    June 30 , 2011). In the Balance Sheet Database SMEs are defined in line with the definition by the EU (see
    Table 7 above).

    Online survey

    The chapters “Accounting practices in Austrian SME s”, “Auditing financial statements”, “SME financing”, and
    “Financial reporting and access to finance” draw on data from an online survey that was conduc ted between
    October and November 2012. The online survey was created with Lime Survey – an open source tool for the
                                                   th
    development of online surveys. On October 16 , 2012 the invitation to participate in the survey was sent to
    about 17,300 e-mail addresses from the address database provided by Herold Business Data GmbH. Around
                                                                                                      th
    1,000 e-mail invitations were not delivered due to wrong or invalid addresses. On November 5 , 2012 a
    reminder was sent to all enterprises that had not returned the completed questionnaire. The online survey
                                     th
    was available until November 12 , 2012. Finally, 786 surveys were completed properly and were used for the
    analysis.

    It was not a requirement that all questions had to be answered and questionnaires where at least two-thirds
    of all questions were answered were included in the analysis. All results have been weighted by industry and
    by the number of employees according to the basic company population in Austria. Data analysis has been
    carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 19. In addition to this report a document containing all the output tables
    has been produced. This document includes all results by sector and by enterprise size.

     In order to avoid biased average values the following sectors were excluded due to their high heterogeneity: Holding companies and real
    estate activities.

    SMEs employ almost 1.8 million persons, including around 0.3 million self-employed. This represents almost
    67% of all persons employed in the market-oriented economy in Austria. As Table 4 shows, almost a quarter of
    Austrians employed in the market-oriented economy works in micro-enterprises, about 23% in small
    enterprises, and nearly 19% in medium-sized enterprises. Most self-employed people are to be found in the
    micro-enterprise sector.

    Financial situation of SMEs in Austria

    For Austrian SMEs in the market-oriented economy equity amounted to 28.5% of total assets. This “equity
    ratio” is higher for enterprises in the larger size classes.

    Between 2006/07 and 2009/10 the average equity ratio in Austrian SMEs increased by 5 percentage points. It
    remained at this high level in 2010/11.

    On average Austrian SMEs’ indebtedness to banks accounts for 28% of SMEs’ total assets. The smaller the
    enterprise, the higher the bank indebtedness: while indebtedness to banks accounts for almost 47% of assets
    in micro-enterprises, this percentage is considerably lower in small enterprises (36%), medium-sized
    enterprises (21.5%) and large enterprises (10.8%).

    The average debt ratio decreased by more than 5 percentage points to 28.3% between 2006/07 and 2010/11.
    This fall almost exactly balances the increase in the equity ratio over the same period.

    Organization Profiles

    The Austrian Institute for SME Research

    The Austrian Institute for SME Research (KMU Forschung Austria) specializes in social and economic research
    focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Institute was founded in 1954 and it is an
    independent, private, non-profit organization. It mainly informs decision making processes in the public sector.
    The main addressees of the Institute’s research are institutions responsible for economic policy-making and
    business development, enterprises and their advisors (management and tax consultants, trustees, banks, etc.)
    as well as universities and other higher education and research institutions. Their research outputs are
    generally available to the public.

    The institute has about 35 highly qualified staff members with many years of experience in applied economic
    research. A variety of academic backgrounds and research areas within the institute ensure an interdisciplinary
    approach. Additionally, some staff members have longstanding work experience in the private sector - partly in
    executive positions. This adds to their practice-orientation and focus on implementation. They put an
    emphasis on continuous training - in research methods and research management as well as social and
    personal skills.

    The Austrian Institute for SME Research co-operates closely with research institutions from almost every
    European country and numerous international organizations. It is inter alia a network member of the Austrian
    Cooperative Research (ACR) and of the European Network for Social and Economic Research (ENSR).

    The World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting Reform

    The Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) is a World Bank unit operating in Vienna, Austria,
    responsible for assisting countries in the Europe and Central Asia region with corporate sector financial
    reporting reform activities.

    The CFRR provides knowledge and technical assistance services to support governments and other
    stakeholders in their reform efforts. The CFRR knowledge services include analytical and advisory activities, in
    the form of technical assistance, capacity building, learning-, and knowledge transfer activities. In addition to
    preparing the diagnostic Accounting and Auditing Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (A&A
    ROSC reports) and related follow-up activities, the CFRR is presently implementing two major technical
    assistance (TA) programs:

    (i) The Road to Europe: Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS)

    The Road to Europe: Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS) is a multi-donor
    trust fund (MDTF) that aims to assist countries in adopting and implementing effective corporate financial
    reporting systems, aligned with the EU acquis communautaire. Beneficiary countries currently include Albania,
    Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova and Serbia. The MDTF
    currently finances a World Bank-executed program (referred to as the regional program), which makes
    available activities to all countries, and a national project in Albania which is led by the Albanian Government.
    Funding for the REPARIS MDTF is provided by the Austrian Development Agency, the Austrian Finance
    Ministry, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. The REPARIS
    MDTF is managed by the Vienna-based World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR). It was
    established in late 2008 and is currently due to run until the end of 2013.

    (ii) The Financial Reporting Technical Assistance Program (FRTAP)

    The Financial Reporting Technical Assistance Program (FRTAP) is a technical assistance program for the new EU
    member states financed by the government of Switzerland. FRTAP is a fee-for-service program, with the CFRR
    acting as its implementing agency, which aims to assist the new member states in implementing the
    requirements of the acquis communautaire in the field of financial reporting.

    The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (WKOE)

    The legal representation of interests for Austrian business is handled by the Economic Chamber Organization.
    This consists of the Federal Economic Chamber (Wirtschaftskammer Oesterreich or WKOE, headquartered in
    Vienna), and nine Regional Chambers in the federal provinces. Together these bodies represent more than
    400,000 member companies. Every single person who is entitled to operate an independent business venture
    in crafts and trades, industry, mining, finance, banking and insurance, transport, information and
    communication, broadcasting, tourism and leisure, as well as other services, is a member of the WKOE by
    Austrian law.

    In addition to industry sectors, trade groups, trade associations, guilds and boards, the WKOE also provides
    services for its members through its departments which are responsible for tasks related to policy,
    organization and service provision.

    The Economic Policy Department of the WKOE is active in monitoring and improving the framework
    conditions for economic activity and entrepreneurship in Austria. It establishes facts and designs strategies and
    solutions on issues relevant to economic and societal development on the national, European, and
    international level and communicates them to policy makers, social partners, scientists, NGOs, and the media.

    The Institute for Economic Promotion (Wirtschaftsfoerderungsinstitut, WIFI) of the WKOE was founded in
    1946 to offer professional support and further education to Chamber members. With a market share of 20
    percent, the WIFI is the largest training and adult education institute in Austria. Some 320.000 participants
    attend 26.000 courses taught by 11.000 freelance trainers in Austria a year.
