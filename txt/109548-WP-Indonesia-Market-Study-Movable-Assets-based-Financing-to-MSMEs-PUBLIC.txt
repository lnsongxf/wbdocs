    Executive Summary


    The report aims to assess the current market for movable assets based lending
    with respect to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs)1 in Indonesia.
    The sections of the report highlight the addressable demand for MSMEs
    and the current supply provided by various formal sources of financing in
    Indonesia. Traditionally, financial institutions have preferred lending against
    fixed asset collateral only. Using that as a starting point, the report seeks to
    identify the current challenges in lending against movable assets. It further
    extends the need for a greater financial infrastructure that can facilitate the
    ability of lenders to evaluate risks in movable assets based lending.

    This report delves into the lending challenges faced by MSMEs as well as
    the challenges that restrict greater supply of credit by financial institutions.
    It draws on data and insights based on discussions with over 70 financial
    institutions in Indonesia, and an understanding of the credit requirements
    of MSMEs – based on over 850 sample cases for quantitative data. These
    findings were further examined through in-depth qualitative discussions
    with 34 MSMEs spread across multiple regions in Indonesia.

    As the Indonesian economy follows a traditional model of providing credit
    based on fixed collateral, such as land and buildings, the study focuses on (i)
    understanding the current credit demand that can be potentially addressed
    by movable assets to complement the traditional model, and (ii) the
    challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate the ensuing movable assets
    based lending.

    Demand-supply gap in lending to MSMEs

    Demand for credit has been steadily increasing and while the various
    regulators and government bodies have taken measures to address the
    increasing demand, the current demand-supply gap is IDR 3,826.5 trillion,2
    which is very significant and presents a clear opportunity to tap the market.
    The report highlights opportunities that various financial institutions,
    including commercial banks, can look into to facilitate a better financial
    ecosystem and create greater supply of credit to boost economic growth.
    While commercial banks continue to be major contributors to the overall
    formal supply, they have refrained from adopting innovative lending models.
    They have also not lent on movable assets, which form more than 50 percent
    of the MSMEs asset base in Indonesia.


    1 MSME refers to micro, small and medium enterprises. Indonesian MSME law of 2008 defines
    MSMEs based on net assets and annual sales, and the same definition has been used for the
    purpose of the study. The definition has been detailed in section 3 of this report.	
    2 The estimated MSME credit demand-supply gap, from formal financial institutions, have been
    calculated at IDR 3,826.5 trillion (~USD 383 billion) which has been detailed further in the
    demand-supply gap section of the report (IDR to USD is taken as 10,000 IDR=1USD)

Market potential for Movable assets based lending

With respect to the sector level contribution for credit, while Agriculture
constitutes almost 50 percent of the enterprises, its supply portfolio is
less than 20 percent. With an unmet demand of over IDR 2,661 trillion in
Agriculture, the sector needs specific policy changes to address this gap.
Additionally, a greater support is required in building robust infrastructure
to facilitate the various financial lending models such as warehouse receipts
and factoring, among others. Similarly, even at a sector agnostic level,
there are clear opportunities with respect to creating a conducive business
environment for a variety of assets such as accounts receivable, inventory,
livestock, etc. to coexist in the financial lending portfolio.

Fixed asset collateral provides better risk coverage as compared to movable
collateral, and such fixed assets enjoy a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of as high
as 80 percent. However, the limited resources that MSMEs have to provide as
their collateral are largely movable assets in nature. Considering the scarcity
of fixed assets that render MSMEs ineligible to seek financing, even a 25–35
percent LTV on movable assets can significantly address the overall market
requirements.

Addressing key challenges to facilitate a greater lending against
Movable Assets

For some banks, financing MSMEs is a very risky business proposition
indeed. This is not surprising as some of the risks, such as cultural aspects
and the business environment in which these businesses thrive, are beyond
the capability of the banks to handle. Empirical evidence suggests that there
are challenges and legal issues to obtain and enforce loan collateral.

The report seeks to decode these challenges and deliver findings that might
serve as triggers for the design of new, more effective methods of providing
credit to MSMEs and accelerate development of the largest contributor to the
overall GDP.

The challenges discussed in the report have largely been categorized into:

   1.	 technical capacity related challenges,
   2.	 infrastructural challenges and
   3.	 legal constraints.




                                                                                  II
      These challenges are, in detail:

      1.	 The technical capacity challenges from an MSME perspective relate to
          lack of know-how on the credit process and the relevant documentation
          required to avail credit. The same from a financial institution’s
          perspective, it is the lack of technical know-how on effective collateral
          valuation mechanism for movable assets.
      2.	 The infrastructure related challenges refer to the limited availability
          of historical data on borrowers and their loan pledges, further lack of
          notaries to address the increasing demand to register a security in the
          Fiducia and an inadequate capacity of warehouse facilities to support
          warehouse receipt financing for agriculture produce.
      3.	 The legal constraints refer to key enforcement related challenges and the
          various reforms that need to be brought about to foster greater movable
          lending environment.

      Key Recommendations

      Financial institutions while providing credit to MSMEs press for collateral,
      especially for land, but do not emphasize on the legal registration of the
      enterprises with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. This results in a
      large number of enterprises not getting registered thereby losing out on the
      legal status of the enterprise. In order to create a more legalized and formal
      structure, there is a need to make policy changes regarding the formalization
      of entities. The formalization should lead to lower risk to financial
      institutions, and, hence, to borrowers receiving credit at a lower rate than
      non-formal entities..

      Regularization of the land titles and ownership rights can address a
      significant portion of the problem relating to the real estate ownership. Steps
      along these lines have been already initiated by the Bank Indonesia (BI), the
      Central Bank of Indonesia, and would prove very effective in the long run.
      Recommended steps include acceptance of documents signed by the village
      head in case of the land title registered in the name of ancestors. While this
      is an important step to regularize land titles, the larger issue is that the most
      MSMEs do not have fixed assets to provide as collateral for seeking credit.
      Therefore, an encouragement of alternate options for credit collateral such
      as movable assets, e.g. accounts receivable, inventory, livestock, furniture
      and other movable assets, need a greater focus by financial regulators. While
      the fixed assets as collateral provide a safe security against risk of default, a
      significant impetus could be provided to the credit supply if the regulators,
      for example, can provide credit guidelines that can be designed for lending
      against movable assets.




III
It is also important to bring clarity in terms of addressable demand-supply
gap and lending models that various financial institutions can adopt, so that
there is a shift of focus from capturing the same part of the pie to penetrating
an untapped market segment. Creating a space for movable asset based
lending models like warehouse receipt financing, factoring, supply chain
financing, etc., can also go a long way towards tapping the unmet demand
and minimize the demand supply gap to increase supply of productive
capital.

Effective credit information sharing, i.e. credit histories collection and
consistent dissemination across various financial institutions via credit
bureaus, is imperative to ensure that good quality loans are provided
with reduced risks of default by MSME-borrowers. The study also covers
recommendations on challenges with respect to the collateral registration
and enforcement of collections of the movable assets provided as collateral
for loans in cases on non-repayment of loan.

The last section of the report addresses best practices of various countries
such as Vietnam, Ghana and China that had lending challenges similar to
those in Indonesia and successfully implemented secured transactions
reforms, resulting in the creation of a greater financial ecosystem for
managing movable collateral.

1. Introduction and Objectives
1.1.	    Background

Indonesia is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and a member
of G20 major economies. The GDP of Indonesia was USD 878.2 billion1 in
2012, making it the sixteenth largest economy in the world.

Micro, small and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the key contributors
to the country’s economic resilience during the 2008–09 economic
crisis.2 They employ more than 92 percent of the country’s workforce but
only contribute to 57.12 percent3 of the GDP. This low productivity is one
of the main problems for the Indonesian MSMEs.

According to the Enterprise Survey conducted for Indonesia by the
World Bank in 2009, more than 47 percent of Indonesian micro, small
and medium enterprises (MSMEs) believe that lack of financing is the
biggest obstacle to their business. Only 51.5 percent (world average
is 87.8 percent) of Indonesian MSMEs have a bank account, of which
only 18.2 percent have a bank loan or a line of credit. Poor access to
financing can be considered as a major reason for the low productivity of
Indonesian MSMEs.

Financial institutions (FIs) in Indonesia have traditionally considered
fixed assets, particularly land holdings, as a measure of the borrower’s
credit-worthiness. Indonesian MSMEs4 have limited fixed assets putting
them at a disadvantage in terms of access to financial credit. MSMEs
assets are tied up as collateral for obtaining term loans, leaving them in
difficulty while obtaining working capital loan from FIs.

While movable assets like vehicles and equipment are accepted by
some FIs as collateral, MSMEs do not have significant holding in these
non-land assets. Most of their assets are related to sales proceeds,
accounts receivable, inventory, etc. Thus, improving the regulatory and
institutional framework, allowing FIs to lend against these movable
assets would improve credit access for MSMEs. This would play a pivotal
role in increasing their productivity, and, in turn, would lead to a greater
development of the economy.

    1.2.	   Objectives of the Study

    The study was conducted, from September to December 2013, to
    understand the current level of financing to MSMEs in Indonesia and the
    current institutional support for lending. The key objectives of the study
    were to:
        a) Provide an estimate of the current level of financing to MSMEs by FIs
        in Indonesia, against movable collateral, including:
            •	 Types of collateral used,
            •	 Models being used,
            •	 Main active players, and
            •	 History of non-performing loans.
        b) Compare the level of credit extended in Indonesia against movable
        collateral to global benchmarks.
        c) Analyze the size of the market for financing against movable collateral
        that can be potentially tapped by FIs with suitable products and with
        the support of enabling infrastructure such as a collateral registry.
        d) Identify the current hurdles for FIs in accessing this market segment.
        e) Identify percentage of loans to MSMEs that are not approved based
        on collateral requirements and other factors.
        f) Identify the various government institutions and/or administrative
        agencies where movable collateral is required to be registered/notified
        if pledged asset is used as collateral.

    1.3.	   Approach for the Study

    The study adopted a three-pronged approach to understand the supply,
    demand and institutional infrastructure (Figure 1).

    FIGURE 1 : APPROACH FOR THE STUDY




3
1.3.1.	 Determination of Supply

The financial ecosystem for MSMEs in Indonesia was studied to
understand the interaction between different agencies. The FIs were
classified based on nature of service provided, and supply from each
of these institutions was calculated based on regulatory reporting and
other market reports. For the purpose of the study, only formal sources
of supply were considered. The formal supply was further validated
during the primary research. It has been assumed that any informal
source of credit supply to MSMEs is also a potential target market for
various FIs to address and bring it within the formalized structure of
lending. The lending practices, including types of collateral used and
lending models, were comprehended during the primary interaction. The
primary interactions also helped determine the challenges faced by FIs
in lending.

1.3.2.	 Determination of Demand

The MSMEs in Indonesia were divided into nine sectors as defined by
Statistics Indonesia and Bank Indonesia. Each of these sectors was
further divided into micro, small and medium segments to form 27
homogenous sector-segment groups. The investment and working
capital debt demand for each of the groups was aggregated to determine
the total debt demand for MSMEs in Indonesia. The assumptions for
the demand estimation were validated during the primary interactions
with MSMEs and industry experts. The borrowing preferences and
challenges faced in obtaining finance were also studied during this
phase. In addition, the demand supply gap for each sector was identified
and analyzed further to estimate the gap addressable by movable assets
based lending.

1.3.3.	 Institutional Infrastructure

The laws and regulations within the financial ecosystem relevant for
lending to MSMEs, along with relevant sections pertaining to lending
were identified during the secondary research. The primary interactions
with regulators and other supporting agencies helped in understanding
the genesis of the regulation, the support provided by these agencies and
the additional initiatives taken (or those being considered) to facilitate
greater lending to MSMEs.




                                                                             4
1.3.4.	 Recommendations

FIGURE 2: APPROACH FOR RECOMMENDATIONS




Local lending challenges and global best practices were analyzed to
arrive at key recommendations. These recommendations were validated
through interactions with FIs, regulators and legislative bodies, and
further substantiated through a workshop attended by various key
stakeholders.5

2. MSME Lending Structure
2.1.	   MSME Financial Ecosystem

The Indonesian financial sector comprises of commercial banks, rural
banks, savings and loan cooperatives, venture capital firms, pawnshops,
multifinance companies, insurance companies, pension funds and
money lenders. Table 3 highlights key stakeholders in the financial
ecosystem from the micro, small and medium enterprises’ (MSMEs’)
perspective. While there are also other regulators and legislative bodies
and supporting infrastructure establishments in the ecosystem, the
study viewed the below-mentioned regulators, legislative bodies and
infrastructure enablers as having greatest relevance to creating an
impact on the situation of lending against movable assets.

2.1.1.	 Policy Makers

2.1.1.1. Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs
(Kementerian Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian)

The Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) was formed
in 1966 under the name “Home Ministry for the Economy, Finance
and Industry” to coordinate with different ministries to improve the
macroeconomic indicators for Indonesia. The key functions of the CMEA
are:
    a) Synchronization and coordination of planning, preparation and  	
       implementation of policies in the field of economy,
    b) Control of implementation of the policies indicated above,
    c) Management of assets/wealth of the country, and
    d) Execution of certain tasks given by the President.

The CMEA introduced the Kredit Usaha Rakyat (hereinafter referred to
as the KUR) program to improve financial access for MSME, and is key
stakeholder in implementation of the program. The details of KUR are
provided in Section 4.3.1.3.

2.1.1.2. Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium
Enterprises (Kementerian Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil dan
Menengah)

The main function of the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and
Medium Enterprises (MCSME) is to assist the President of Indonesia
in formulating the policy and coordinating policy implementation for
cooperatives and MSMEs. The key functions of the ministry are:

    a) Formulation of the government policy in the development of
       cooperatives and MSMEs,
    b) Coordination and improvement in the coherence of program
       planning, monitoring, analysis and evaluation of cooperatives and
       MSMEs’ operations,
    c) Increasing community participation in cooperatives and MSMEs,
    d) Coordination of operational activities of development agencies,
       economic resources of the country for the development of
       cooperatives and MSMEs, and
    e) Submission to the President of evaluation reports, suggestions and
       considerations of tasks and functions related to the development
       of cooperatives and MSMEs.




                                                                            8
The MCSME also regulates cooperatives in Indonesia, defining broad
guidelines for them rather than exerting direct control over them. Many
cooperatives are also registered with provincial governments.

2.1.1.3. State Ministry of National Development Planning
(Bappenas)

The vision of the Ministry of National Development Planning and the
National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) is to be reliable,
credible and proactive in supporting the development of Indonesia and the
Indonesian provinces.

To achieve this vision, Bappenas takes necessary action in the form of three
missions, as indicated below.

1. Preparation of the national development plan that is able to:
    •	 Integrate, synchronize, and synergize between regions, spaces,
        different periods of time, and local governments across functions, as
        well as between centers and regions,
    •	 Realize the relevance of and consistency between planning, budgeting,
        implementation and monitoring,
    •	 Optimize community participation, and
    •	 Use resources in a manner which is efficient, effective, equitable and
        sustainable.
2. Monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the implementation of
   the national development plan, review and evaluation of the quality policy
   development issues, as input for the next planning process or for policy
   formulation and development in various fields.
3. Execution of effective coordination in the implementation of the tasks of
   Bappenas.

2.1.2.	 Regulators

2.1.2.1. Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan)

The former Bapepam-LK was governed by the Ministry of Finance, which
developed, managed and oversaw the daily operations of capital markets in
Indonesia. It was also entrusted to formulate and implement policies and
standards for financial institutions (FIs) in Indonesia. In 2011, in accordance
with Law no. 21/2011, Bapepam-LK was transformed into Otoritas Jasa
Keuangan (OJK).

OJK is the Government of Indonesia (GoI) agency that regulates and
supervises the financial services sector. It is an autonomous agency and its
functions, duties and powers include regulation, supervision, inspection and
investigation. OJK has the task of regulating and supervising the activities of
the financial services sector.




9
OJK supervises non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and includes insurance
and guarantee companies, equity and debt market players, venture capital firms,
several types of cooperatives, and pension companies. Most of Bank Indonesia’s
(BI) functions, duties and authorities related to regulation of banks were
transferred to OJK effective 31 December 2013. Under this new structure, the OJK
as an independent entity reports directly to the Indonesian Parliament.

2.1.2.2. Bank Indonesia

Bank Indonesia (BI) is the central bank of Indonesia and was the main regulator
for the banking sector (both commercial and rural banks) until 31 December
2013. BI had in the past taken various steps including formulating committees
to reduce information asymmetries and improve access to finance to MSMEs.
For example, in 2012, it mandated that 20 percent of the bank’s lending portfolio
should be in the MSME sector by 2018. Other initiatives taken by BI are discussed
at a greater length in the subsequent sections of this report.

Following the transfer of BI’s regulatory and supervisory authorities to OJK, it no
longer has direct access to information on the micro prudential banking because
the primary function and responsibilities of BI are now related to the macro
prudential regulation, establishing and enforcing monetary policy,6 payment
systems and foreign exchange.

2.1.3.	 Supporting Infrastructure

2.1.3.1. Fiducia Registration Office – Ministry of Law and Human
Rights (Kementerian Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia)

A fiduciary transfer is established in the form of a notarized deed in Bahasa
Indonesia between the transferrer (borrower) and the transferee (lender). In
accordance with the Fiduciary Transfer Law of 1999, the transferee must register
the fiduciary transfer agreement in the fiducia registration book kept by the
Fiducia Registration Office (FRO). Registration is also necessary if the transferred
assets are outside the country. Although there is no finite time frame defined for
the registration, the transfer comes in effect only on the date of registration. If
the transferrer fraudulently signs the transfer deed with more than one lender,
then the first lender to register the transfer deed will obtain enforceable security
interest. The transferee will obtain a fiduciary registration certification post
acceptance of registration application.

The FRO initiated an online registration system in February 2013. Currently the
online system is available only to notaries for registration, and the legacy data has
not yet been digitized. While the registry information contains information on the
collateral registered, the registry currently does not capture any specifics of the
collateral, which facilitates clear identification of the uniqueness of the collateral.

 2.1.3.2. Indonesian Derivatives Clearing House (PT Kliring Berjangka
 Indonesia, Persero)

 The clearing house acts as a registry for warehouse receipts under the Warehouse
 Receipt Law. The security over warehouse receipts can be created by following the
 steps given below:

      a) Loan agreement between borrower and creditor,
      b) Deed of security agreement between borrower and creditor,
      c) Notification to the clearing house and the warehouse manager that the
        warehouse receipts have been encumbered,
      d) Recording the security over warehouse receipt in the registry book of
        security,
      e) Confirmation of security encumbrance and written confirmation to the
        security grantee.

 The security grantee will hold the warehouse security receipt and therefore it
 cannot be double encumbered.

 2.1.3.3. Credit Guarantee Companies

 There are two central credit guarantee companies in Indonesia – Perum
 Jamkrindo and PT (Persero) Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (Askrindo). These
 companies guarantee (up to 80 percent) the loans provided under KUR. Under
 KUR, guarantee fees at the rate of 3.25 percent7 of the credit coverage are paid by
 the Government annually. The GoI infuses IDR 2 trillion equity annually8 into these
 two firms depending on their performance, increasing their ability to guarantee
 more loans.

 In addition to these central companies, two regional companies, PT Jamkrida Bali
 Mandara and PT Jamkrida Java, also guarantee loans under the KUR program.
 The GoI also plans to set up four more regional companies – PT Jamkrida Riau, PT
 Jamkrida NTB Bersaing, PT Jamkrida West Java, and PT Jamkrida West Sumatera
 to increase MSME financing.

 2.1.3.4. Credit Bureau

 Currently (as of December 2013) BI maintains a Debtor Information System or
 Sistem Informasi Debitur (SID) which captures data from 120 commercial banks,
 1304 Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (BPR) and 20 NBFIs. Parameters captured in SID
 are limited to the name of the debtor and creditor and the repayment status of the
 credit. Any credit information or history of individuals and businesses on account
 of loans from MFIs is currently not captured by the SID.

11
Through regulation 15/1/PBI/2013, BI has opened the credit information sharing
practice to private entities. The new credit bureaus (Lembaga Pengelola Informasi
Perkreditan – LPIP) are expected to increase the breadth of the data captured
(such as utility bills). Microfinance institution (MFI) associations such as Credit
Union Central of Indonesia (Induk Koperasi Kredit; INKOPDIT) also started a pilot
program in November 2013 called Sistim Koperasi Perkreditan (SISKOPDIT) to
capture data of its 930+ members.

2.1.3.5. Police Department

Motor vehicles are the major collateral for movable assets based lending in
Indonesia. FIs retain the possession of the vehicle ownership certificate to
safeguard their interest upon lending. Since the owner of the vehicle could get
the certificate reissued from the Police Department and sell this vehicle, the
transfer of ownership is also processed through the Police Department. To
prevent issuance of new ownership certificate and avoid transfer of ownership
registration under lien, FIs file a petition with the Police Department to restrict
reissuance of the certificate until the debt against the vehicle is paid in full. The
Police Department provides this service at a nominal charge of IDR 50,000,9 and
also provides support to the FIs during collateral repossession and execution. In
2011, the Chief of National Police Force issued order no. 08 of 2011 regarding
the execution of the fiduciary collateral. The order aimed to ensure peaceful,
accountable and orderly execution of fiduciary security while ensuring safety and
security of creditor, debtor and/or the public from any action during execution
that may inflict loss to property and/or public safety.

2.1.3.6. Credit Rating Agencies

Credit rating for MSMEs in Indonesia is still in a nascent stage. BI has started
a pilot program, in 2013, to develop a common rating matrix for MSMEs. Four
rating agencies – ICRA Indonesia, PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (PT PEFINDO),
MICRA Indonesia and Dun & Bradstreet – are involved in this initiative. These
rating agencies are working with banks in Indonesia including Bank Mandiri to
align the credit ratings with FIs’ internal credit approval mechanism. The factors
considered while designing the credit rating are entrepreneur’s profile, review of
firm’s operational and financial management systems, asset base and past credit
history.

Positive credit rating makes it easier for MSMEs to obtain credit at a cheaper
rate. Further investigations are required to understand the penetration of these
services among MSMEs.

                                                                                        12
 2.1.3.7. Industry Associations

 There are many FI associations in Indonesia including Perbarindo for rural
 banks, Asosiasi Perusahaan Pembiayaan Indonesia (APPI) for consumer finance
 companies and INKOPDIT for credit unions (CUs). They assist the FIs in forming
 lending policies and act as advocates of FIs with the legislative bodies and
 regulators. APPI’s efforts were instrumental in OJK clarifying that the registration
 of fiducia was not compulsory for consumer finance companies.

 Though these associations do not formally perform duties of the regulators, many
 FIs follow the guidelines and models proposed by the association. They also play
 an important role in technical capacity improvement of MFIs.

 2.2. Legal Framework

 A strong legal infrastructure defining borrowers’ and creditors’ rights
 and regulations providing guidelines to FIs is pertinent to increase MSME
 financing in Indonesia.

 2.2.1. Laws Governing Lending

 In Indonesia, lending and movable assets based lending in particular is not
 governed by a single law. The Indonesian Civil Code, the Company Law, the
 Fiduciary Transfer Law and the Warehouse Receipt Law are the key laws
 governing movable assets based lending in Indonesia (Table 1).

 The key implementer of the law is customarily defined as a legislative body
 or an agency formed under the law. However, in many cases policy makers,
 especially regulators like BI and OJK, are responsible for implementing/
 enforcing the lending related laws owing to the nature of their duties and
 responsibilities.

TABLE 1:
LAWS GOVERNING MOVABLE ASSETS BASED LENDING IN INDONESIA




2.2.1.1. The Indonesian Civil Code

Chapters XX and XXI of Book Two (Assets) Indonesian Civil Code deal exclusively
with pledges and mortgages.10 The civil code is implemented by the Indonesian
courts and the central and regional governments. One of the key guidelines in the
Indonesian Civil Code mentions that an asset once pledged cannot be pledged
again until the previous loans are paid in full.

With respect to movable assets based lending, the Indonesian Civil Code defines
a pledge as a right of a creditor (pledgee) to movable property or intangible
assets (e.g., gold, time deposits, shares and certain marketable securities) that are
physically delivered into the possession of the pledgee by a debtor. The pledge
gives the pledgee a preferential right to the proceeds from the sale of the goods
with regard to other creditors.

2.2.1.2. The Company Law (Law no. 40 of 2007)

The new Company Law was passed in 2007 to address gaps in the previous
Company Law. Under the new law, the company registry would be maintained by
the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (MoLHR), which is also responsible for
approving Articles of Association and reduction in paid-up capital. The MoLHR
should also be informed within 30 days of change of shareholders and has the
right to reject the change if certain requirements are not met.
10 State Gazette number 23 Year 1847




                                                                                        14
 The Company Law also allows the pledging or encumbering shares with fiduciary
 security unless mentioned otherwise in the Articles of Association of the
 company. The pledges and fiduciary security are required to be registered in the
 shareholders register. The Company Law also keeps the voting rights of these
 shares with the shareholder. Besides this, the dynamic nature of share pricing and
 treatment of dividend payment adds complexity from a fiducia perspective.

 2.2.1.3. The Fiduciary Transfer Law (Law no. 42 of 1999)

 The Fiduciary Transfer Law of 1999 which became effective in September 1999
 requires that the fiduciary transfer agreement is in the form of a notarized deed
 and needs to be registered with the FRO managed by the MoLHR. A fiduciary
 transfer is the transfer of title in trust for securing debt to the creditor. Once the
 debt is paid the title is transferred back to the original owner. In case of default,
 the transfer is not completely transferred to the creditor, but the creditor has the
 right to sell the transferred asset to recover the debt. While this law provides the
 basic framework for movables finance, the process is nevertheless marred with
 shortcomings such as inadequate infrastructure (shortage of notaries) and high
 costs.

 The key implementing agencies for this law are the MoLHR, notaries, and financial
 regulators. It should be noted that the law only gives the creditor the executionary
 right to sell the asset, but no right to ownership of the asset.

 2.2.1.4. The Warehouse Receipt Law (Law no. 9 of 2011)

 This law is an amended version of Law no. 9 of 2006. This law was implemented
 to address business demands regarding warehouse receipts. The significant
 amendment to this law includes removal of the clause which stated that the value
 of the warehoused goods would be equal to market price of the goods at the time
 of storage. This law also calls for formation of a warehouse receipts guarantee
 institution which would also play a significant role in deciding the damages
 related to loss or damage of goods during storage. This law also allows the use
 of warehouse receipts as collateral and gives flexibility to producers to sell their
 goods when the market prices are right.

 The warehouse receipt system is overseen by the Warehouse Receipt System
 Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas Resi Gudang). The Commodity Futures
 Trading Regulatory Agency (CoFTRA) or BAPPEPTI is currently performing the
 duties of the Warehouse System Supervisory Agency. The Indonesian Derivate
 Clearing House (PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia) under a licence from BAPPEPTI
 currently serves as the Central Register for the warehouse receipt system and
 records, stores, transfers ownership, and imposes the rights guarantees of
 warehouse receipts. Supporting infrastructure including warehouses, warehouse
 managers and surveyors needs to be developed to achieve the full potential of
 financing based on this law.




15
2.2.2. Regulations

There are two key BI regulations for promotion of lending to MSMEs. These are
discussed below.

2.2.2.1. PBI no. 14/22/PBI/2012 for Commercial Banks 11

This regulation was issued by BI in December 2012. The highlights of the regulation
are:

a) Twenty percent of commercial banks portfolios should be lent to MSMEs:
   •	 Banks to take their best effort for the years 2013 and 2014,
   •	 Five percent of total lending portfolio until 2015 and then 5 percent increase
      every year until 2018.
b) Realization either through direct lending to MSMEs or indirectly lending through
   linkage programs with BPRs and cooperatives like channeling, executing or co-
   financing.
c) Harmonization of the definition of microenterprise credit, small enterprise credit,
   and medium enterprise credit with the MSME law of 2008.
12
  d) Technical assistance for increasing capacities of FIs and MSMEs in the form of
   research, training, provision of information, and facilitation.
e) Regulation of MSME credit or financing based on pre-existing BI regulations governing
   banks business plan, monthly report, quarterly and monthly financial publication
   report, and certain other reports, debtor information system, transparency of banks
   product information and utilization of customers personal data.
f) Regulation of the publication on MSME credit ratio achievement from each
   commercial bank in BI’s website for better coordination with other organizations
g) Penalty at 2 percent of the non-compliant amount, capped at IDR 10 billion (the exact
   quantum of penalty was published in mid-2013); based on discussions with BI.

2.2.2.2. PBI no. 13/26/PBI/2011 for Rural Banks

This regulation was issued by BI on 28 December, 2011 as an amendment of PBI
no. 8/19/PBI/2006 on Earning Assets Quality and Establishment of Allowance for
Earning Assets of Rural Banks. The PBI aims to:
a) Encourage BPR lending to MSMEs while being prudent,
b) Harmonize the provisions of the asset quality and allowance for productive asset
for rural banks.
c) Ease lending based on gold jewelry, debt securities by GoI, warehouse receipts,
business premises/kiosk/stall/right to use, credit guarantee by the state/local
enterprises as collateral (details in section 6.2.2.1.1).

In addition to these regulations, the Ministry of Finance issued a regulation13 for NBFIs
in 2012, making it compulsory for NBFIs to register loans on vehicles with the FRO.

 2.2.2.3. The Minister of Finance’s directive no. 130/PMK.010/2012 for
 Finance Companies

 This directive specified that financing companies dealing with consumer finance
 for motor vehicles shall register the fiducia with the FRO no later than 30 calendar
 days from the date of consumer financing agreement. The finance companies
 were also prohibited from executing the collateral in the absence of a fiduciary
 certificate. The penalties for non-compliance included warning, suspension of
 business activity, or revocation of business licenses. Later, in response to the
 complaints raised by the finance companies, the regulator for consumer finance
 companies, OJK made a clarification of the interpretation of the Ministry of
 Finance’s directive. OJK specified that only the consumer finance companies
 collecting the fiduciary cost from consumers are obliged to register with the
 MoLHR. The finance companies which do not wish to use fiducia instruments are
 not obliged to register, consequently prohibited from collecting fees to establish
 fiduciary certificate, which has been the case for quite some time.

3. Addressable Demand for Financing for
MSMEs
This section provides an overview of the MSME demand in Indonesia
informed by the primary desk research. The demand of debt finance by
Indonesian MSMEs is also estimated in this section.

3.1. Definition of Indonesian MSMEs

The Indonesian MSMEs are generally classified based on asset size,
number of employees, and revenues. The Indonesian MSME law of
200814 defines MSMEs based on net assets and annual sales, whereas
the enterprise survey defines MSMEs based on the number of employees
(Table 2).

TABLE 2 DEFINITION OF INDONESIAN MSMEs

                               Net Assets*                 Annual Sales             Number of Employees **
        Firm Size
                            (MSME Law 2008)              (MSME Law 2008)         (World Bank Enterprise Survey)
         Micro                < 50 million IDR            < 300 million IDR                   NA
         Small              50-500 million IDR         300–2500 million IDR                  5–19
        Medium            500-10,000 million IDR         2.5–50 billion IDR                  20–99
* Net Assets do not include land and building assets.
** Enterprise Surveys do not cover enterprises with fewer than five employees.


Unless mentioned otherwise, for the purpose of this study, the
definitions as prescribed by the Indonesian MSME law of 2008 have been
used. Net assets have been considered to take precedence over annual
sales when classifying enterprises across micro, small and medium
segments.

3.2. Firms and Employment Statistics
3.2.	     Firms and Employment Statistics
The overall MSME landscape has been categorized based on sector
specific information and seeks to address how each sector contributes
to the growth and penetration of MSMEs. Thus, it would be important
to identify key sectors that play a significant role in the overall MSME
landscape. These sectors have been identified based on their numbers,
employment, GDP contribution, asset base and sales.

     3.2.1.	 Distribution across Micro, Small and Medium Segments

     In 2012,15 there were more than 56.5 million MSMEs in Indonesia
     employing more than 107 million people, which is about 92 percent of
     the total working population of 240 million.

     Microenterprises constitute more than 98 percent of the MSME space
     and provide employment to more than 92 percent of the workforce
     working in Indonesian MSMEs. These enterprises mostly work in the
     informal sector and have no legal documentation, making it more
     difficult for them to access credit through formal channels.

     3.2.2.	 Distribution across Industrial Sectors

     In line with the classification made by Badan Pusat Statistik (Statistic
     Indonesia or BPS) and BI, for the purpose of this assignment, the MSMEs
     are distributed among nine broad sectors.

     1. Agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries (Agri)
     2. Construction (Con)
     3. Electricity, gas and water supply (EG&WS)
     4. Finance, rent and services (Fin)
     5. Manufacturing (Man)
     6. Mining and quarrying (M&Q)
     7. Transport and communication (T&C)
     8. Trade, hotels and restaurants (THR)
     9. Services (Ser)

Microenterprises in the agriculture sector constitute 51.5 percent of the overall
MSME enterprises and employ more than 45 percent of the total MSME workforce
(Figures 5). After the microenterprises in agriculture, those in the trade, hotels
and restaurants sector dominate the industrial landscape, with 23.67 percent of
the total enterprises’ number and 28.07 percent of the total employment.

The sectoral information for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs)
provides a different perspective. The trade, hotels and restaurants sector
dominates both small and medium sectors in the number of enterprises, followed
by the manufacturing sector (Figures 4).

 Agriculture, trade, hotels and restaurants, and the manufacturing sectors are
 key sectors in the Indonesian MSME landscape and constitute more than 80
 percent of the total MSME enterprises.

 3.2.3.	 Growth of MSMEs

 Since 2006, the number of MSMEs in Indonesia has been growing at an annual
 rate of 2.4 percent as can be seen in Figure 6.

The number of people employed per firm has also grown from 1.79 to 1.95
employees in the last six years.

3.3. GDP Contribution of MSMEs

MSMEs contribute to 57.12 percent19 of Indonesia’s GDP. The level of
contribution of MSMEs to GDP has remained stable since 2006 (around 58
percent). Sectoral GDP contribution is shown in Figure 7.

FIGURE 7: SECTORAL GDP CONTRIBUTION20




Since the sectoral GDP contribution has remained fairly constant since 2006,
21
  it has been assumed that contribution of MSMEs in individual sectors has
also remained constant.

 FIGURE 8: MSMEs’ CONTRIBUTION TO GDP IN 201222




 Even though agriculture employs nearly half of Indonesia’s work force, the per
 capita contribution (IDR 6.9 million) to the economy (economy wide average
 of IDR 13.77 million) is significantly lower than for all the other sectors.

 The next biggest sector in Indonesia, trade, hotels and restaurants (employing
 40 percent fewer people) contributes 27 percent more to the economy than
 does agriculture. The key sectors identified like agriculture, trade, hotels and
 restaurants, and manufacturing are the same as those identified through the
 analysis of number of enterprises and number of employees.

 3.4. Asset Base of MSMEs in Indonesia

 The overall asset base of MSMEs in Indonesia was estimated based on a survey
 conducted by BI in 2008. Though BI has collected various details including
 owners, managers, suppliers, customers, balance sheets, income statements
 and cash flows, only limited information including number of employees, net
 assets and sales is currently available. In this study, information from 861
 enterprises has been captured for the further analysis.

 The information available on the asset base of MSMEs was leveraged for
 estimating the potential addressable investment capital demand for the MSME
 segment.

The value of the average asset per enterprise across sectors in the same
segment, especially the three identified sectors (agriculture, trade, hotels
and restaurants, and manufacturing) is nearly constant (Figure 9). Thus the
sectoral contribution to the total asset base would depend on the number of
enterprises.

The sectoral asset base of MSMEs for 2012 (Figure 10) was projected
assuming that the assets per enterprise would increase by 10 percent
annually and the number of enterprises would increase by the 2.4 percent.24

FIGURE 10: MSME ASSET BASE, 2012 (IDR TRILLION)25




The overall assets of MSMEs in Indonesia are around IDR 1,751 trillion, of
which almost 67 percent are held by microenterprises in the agriculture and
trade, hotels and restaurants sectors. It is important to note that micro sized
agriculture and trade, hotels and restaurants sectors hold 43.7 and 23 percent
of total MSME assets respectively but still contribute only 7.8 and 9.92 percent
to GDP respectively.
23 Based on the survey conducted by Bank Indonesia in 2008 to profile MSMEs, this has been
extrapolated to estimate May 2013 figures IFC analysis.

 3.5. Sales by MSMEs

 The information available on the sales executed by these segments was
 leveraged for estimating the potential addressable working capital demand for
 the MSME segment. The enterprise level sale by each MSME sector across each
 segment was derived from BI’s MSME survey (Figure 11).

 FIGURE 11: SALES PER ENTERPRISE ACROSS SECTORS AND SEGMENTS,
 2012 (IDR MILLION)26




 Unlike the assets per enterprise, the average sales per enterprise vary
 significantly among various sectors and industries.

 The overall sales by MSMEs for 2012 are also estimated based on
 extrapolation of data obtained from surveys conducted by BI (Figure 12).

 FIGURE 12: MSMEs’ SALES (IDR TRILLION)27




 Total sales by MSMEs amount to IDR 18,122 trillion. The micro segment
 of agriculture and trade, hotels and restaurants contribute to more than
 83 percent of the overall sales. Agriculture, trade, hotels and restaurants,
 services, and manufacturing are the key sectors as they contribute to more
 than 95 percent of the total sales by MSMEs.

 extrapolated to estimate May 2013 figures and IFC analysis.

3.6. Estimation of Demand Potential

3.6.1. Estimation of Investment Capital Debt Demand Potential

It is assumed that the total asset base of MSMEs estimated above are assets
created through capital investments. The rate of increase in aggregate assets
is assumed to be 10 percent.28 The total assets are expected to grow from IDR
1,751 trillion in 2012 to IDR 1,973 trillion in 2013. Assuming that 3 percent
of the total increase in assets is due to inflation and other factors, the total
investment required during 2012–13 is pegged at IDR 162.2 trillion and IDR
127.9 trillion during 2013 -14.

Around 70 percent of capital investment is funded through debt, making the
total investment capital debt demand potential IDR 113.53 trillion as captured
in Figure 13.

FIGURE 13: INVESTMENT DEBT CAPITAL DEMAND (IDR TRILLION)29




In the small and medium segments, significant debt demand is observed only
in the THR sector (trade, hotels and restaurants).

3.6.2.	 Estimation of Working Capital Debt Demand Potential

Assuming the growth rates of sales to be the same as that of GDP i.e. 5.2
percent, the total sales by MSMEs in 2012–13 is computed as IDR 18,122
trillion, while in 2013-2014 is computed as IDR 4,700 trillion.

Based on industry information, it is assumed that 25 percent30 of total sales
constitute the total working capital debt demand potential; the total working
capital debt demand is calculated as IDR 4,570.5 trillion. The sector level
break-up of the working capital debt demand is captured in Figure 14.

 The total demand for debt across all MSME segments and sectors in Indonesia
 is around IDR 4,684 trillion. The agriculture sector contributes to around
 60 percent of the demand, followed by trade, hotels and restaurants (23.37
 percent), services (5.91 percent) and manufacturing (5.23 percent).

 3.7.	    Borrowing Preference

 More than 75 percent of the enterprises preferred borrowing from informal
 sources and MFIs rather than from commercial banks.

3.7.1.	 Reasons for Borrowing Preference33

FIGURE 16: BORROWING PREFERENCE




3.7.1.1. Informal Sources

Friends and family are the preferred informal borrowing sources. Ease in
obtaining funds, flexible repayment schedules and minimal or zero interest
rates are the key reasons for this preference. MSMEs generally approach
friends and family for meeting short-term immediate credit requirements. The
ticket sizes are usually small, but in certain cases loans as high as IDR 2 billion
have been obtained from friends and family. Among informal sources, money
lenders, who charge high interest rates, are not desirable.

3.7.1.2. Microfinance Institutions

Many MSMEs especially microenterprises have developed good relationships
with MFIs. Easier loan application processes, relationships and availability of
funds are the reasons for preferring MFIs. Some stakeholders also confirmed
that ease of access (the loan officer from the cooperative visits to collect debt)
has influenced their decision to remain with cooperatives.

3.7.1.3. Commercial Banks

While lower rates of interest and larger size of loans are the major factors
for MSMEs would like to seek loans from commercial banks as opposed to
MFIs, perceived complex documentation, collateral requirements and branch
network inaccessibility are the key challenges faced by MSMEs when trying to
access funds from banks.

3.7.1.4. Self-Financing Internal Funding

Religious reasons are the key reasons for MSMEs not availing themselves of
funds through the financial ecosystem. Lack of awareness of funding programs
and unwillingness to increase operations are also understood to be the
reasons for preference for internal funding.
33 Borrowing preferences were calculated based on 34 MSMEs interviewed across Jakarta, East Java
and Central Java. These regions cover 40 percent of all MSMEs in Indonesia and receive 40 percent of
debt received by MSMEs in Indonesia, as per Bank Indonesia lending data as of May 2013.




                                                                                                       28
 3.8. Geographical Distribution of MSMEs

 FIGURE 17: MSME GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION




 The Economic Survey conducted in 2006 by Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat
 Statistik) divides Indonesia into six key geographies (Figure 17). Java has more
 than 64 percent of the total MSMEs covered in the economic survey, followed by
 18 percent in Sumatera and 7 percent in Sulawesi.

 The survey also divides the country in 33 provinces. The top five geographies
 contribute to 63 percent of the total enterprises. It is important to note that four
 of the five provinces are situated in Java (Table 4).

 3.9. Identification of Key Sectors

 The key sectors in the Indonesian landscape are consistent across various
 parameters as categorized in the above sections. They are:
 a) Agriculture (micro),
 b) Trade, hotels and restaurants (micro, small and medium),
 c) Services (micro), and
 d) Manufacturing (small and medium).
 The supply of finance to these sectors has been further analyzed in the
 subsequent supply section 4, which during the course of the study helped in
 identifying the key sectors for the study.

4. Current Supply of Financing for MSMEs
in Indonesia
This section provides an overview of the credit supply provided to
MSMEs in Indonesia informed by primary surveys and secondary desk
research. The section includes various sources of supply, different
lending models adopted by FIs for MSMEs, and how various FIs are
targeting greater penetration on MSMEs considering the BI mandate on
minimum 20 percent lending portfolio for MSMEs by 2018.

4.1. Supply of Finance to MSMEs

Total flow of financing to MSMEs can be divided into formal and informal
sources. Formal flow of financing is provided by banking and other regulated
lending institutes, whereas informal financing is provided by friends, family
and relatives, unregistered money lenders and informal MFIs.

FIGURE 18: STRUCTURE OF FINANCING




Informal sources of financing contribute 57 percent of the overall supply
to the MSMEs sector.34 This report covers only the formal sources of
lending since lending through informal sources still represents a gap
which can be addressed by the formal sources of financing.

4.2. Formal Flow of Financing to the MSMEs\Sector

Formal sources of MSME lending can be classified into lending by
commercial banks and other formal sources of finance. Commercial
banks form 65 percent of total formal lending to borrowers in
Indonesia.35 Analyses have shown that the loan turnover ratio is

35 Based on the assumption of Banking Share in the overall funds contributed to MSME lending,
provided in Indonesian’s Experiences on Micro Finance Institution and Small Scale Cross Border
Transaction, ADBI-AFDC-ABAC “Asia-Pacific Forum on Financial Inclusion, June 2012, we have
assumed banking sector share in Indonesia as 65% of the overall finance supply.
                                                                                                     30
 approximately one36 (the ratio of the loans disbursed amount to the
 one of loans outstanding) for the Indonesian FIs. Hence, the total annual
 supply of financing is considered to be equal to the total outstanding
 loans at any point in time.37 Based on the loan turnover being equal
 to 1, the total loans disbursed to MSMEs’ through formal sources is
 approximately IDR 857 trillion as of 31 May 2013.

 4.2.1.	 Commercial Banks

 The commercial bank structure in Indonesia consists of state-owned
 banks (SOBs), regional development banks (BPDs) and private national
 banks which can be further classified into foreign exchange banks,
 foreign-owned banks, joint venture (JV) banks and non-foreign exchange
 banks.

 FIGURE 19: TYPES OF COMMERCIAL BANKS (NUMBER OF ENTITIES)




 The total estimated supply of MSME financing from 12038 commercial
 banks is IDR 559 trillion. These banks can be classified as follows:

 State-Owned Banks – State-owned banks (SOBs), are wholly/majority
 owned by the GoI through the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned
 Enterprises (MSOE). These banks are set up with the objective to
 channel resources to “priority” sectors of the economy as well as
 provide financial services to underserved parts of a widely dispersed
 country. They have over many years played an instrumental role in the
 Indonesian economy, given the fact that they control the majority of the
 country’s banking system. Currently, there are four state-owned banks
 in Indonesia namely PT Bank Negara Indonesia (PERSERO) TBK, PT
 Bank Rakyat Indonesia (PERSERO), TBK, PT Bank Tabungan Negara
 (PERSERO) and PT Bank Mandiri (PERSERO), TBK.

 36 Based on primary interviews MFIs and Banks in Indonesia, we have calculated average loan
 turnover ratio. A total of 14 large commercial banks in Indonesia and 53 MFI/MFI holding
 companies were interviewed across Jakarta, East Java and Central Java. Details of the financial
 institutions have been provided in appendix.
 37 Based on the calculation of average loan-turnover ratio, which is 1 in Indonesian case, loan
 outstanding figures can be assumed to be loan disbursed to MSMEs as of 31 May 2013.
 38 Indonesian Banking Statistics, May 2013, Bank Indonesia.




31
Regional Development Banks (BPDs) - Regional development banks
(26 in total), also known as Bank Pembangunan Daerah (Provincial
Development Banks) or BPDs are owned by provincial governments and
act as bankers to their governments. BPDs’ key objective is to support
provincial governments in development and bear the responsibility
of supervising certain small formal FIs that operate under provincial
regulations.

Domestic Private Banks – These include foreign exchange commercial
banks (36) and non-foreign exchange commercial banks (30), owned by
private domestic investors of the country.

Joint Venture Banks/Foreign-Owned Banks –The GoI invited
foreign investors to enter the Indonesian banking market during the
restructuring period 1998–1999, as part of the privatization program.
New foreign banks were allowed to enter the market with low reserve
requirements and through joint ventures. As of December 2013, there
are 14 joint venture banks and 10 foreign-owned banks operating in
Indonesia.

Commercial banks are regulated by BI and under the new architecture
would be regulated by OJK with effect from 31 December 2013.

4.2.1.1. Distribution of Supply across Various Bank Categories

The 30 government controlled banks (including SOBs and BPDs) account
for almost 56 percent of commercial bank lending to MSMEs. Domestic
private banks contribute 42 percent market share and the balance of 2
percent is covered by joint venture banks and foreign banks (Figure 20).

 4.2.1.1. Sharia-Based Commercial Banks

 Commercial banks can also be segregated into conventional banks and
 Sharia-based commercial banks. Conventional commercial banks also
 operate Sharia compliant business units, to provide Sharia compliant
 loans.

 Sharia-based lending constitutes 21 percent (IDR 103.5 trillion) of the
 overall commercial bank lending to MSMEs. Sharia-based banks focus
 more on smaller scale financing, given their limited capital base when
 compared to conventional banks. Thus they lend more to the MSME sector,
 to address their short-term financing needs with smaller loan sizes.

 4.2.1.2. Commercial Bank Lending Sectoral Overview

 The MSME supply of financing has been mapped on nine sectors described in
 Section 3.2.2. Further distribution of sectoral supply by bank category shows
 that all categories of banks follow a similar lending pattern, with THR (trade,
 hotels, restaurants), manufacturing and agriculture receiving the maximum
 amount of lending.

33
FIGURE 21: COMMERCIAL BANKS SECTORAL LENDING BREAKDOWN,
BANK TYPE (IDR TRILLION)42




The THR sector (trade, hotels, restaurants) dominate the MSME financing
space with 51 percent of bank lending to MSMEs in 2013. Commercial
banks prefer lending to THR over other sectors, since this has visible cash
flows and business cycles are small, ensuring early recovery of loans.

4.2.1.3. Distribution of Loan by Segment

FIGURE 22: DISTRIBUTION OF LOAN BY SEGMENT




Currently MSMEs constitute 20 percent of total outstanding loans. This
number is skewed by a few banks with substantial lending towards
MSMEs. Banks such as Bank Pundi Indonesia and PT Prima Master Bank
report the lending contribution to MSMEs constitutes more than 90
percent of their total portfolio, whereas others such as43 Bank Central Asia,
SBI Indonesia, Bank Sinarmas, Bank DKI, etc. lend less than 10 percent to
MSMEs. Even for JV and foreign-owned banks, most of the MSME lending
is institutional in nature as these banks have limited local reach and are
primarily involved in supply chain financing.

 Supply of financing by commercial banks is skewed towards medium
 enterprises (51 percent of overall MSME lending) followed by small
 enterprises (30 percent) and microenterprises (20 percent).

 4.2.1.4. Government Regulation for Commercial Bank Lending
 to MSME

 In 2012, BI issued a regulation directing all banks to channel a minimum
 of 20 percent of their total loans to the MSME sector by 2018 through a
 phased approach, as discussed in Section 2.2.2.1. BI also encourages banks
 to grow their branch offices in areas with lower population density so that
 the banking sector can be accessed by customers in remote areas.

 Currently, around 55 percent45 of the current 120 banks in Indonesia do
 not meet the criteria of lending 20 percent to MSME. If the lending norms
 are met by banks, in 2018 the overall MSMEs lending would result in an
 additional supply of credit by around IDR 200 trillion.46 The net increase
 of MSME supply of financing is still marginal when compared to the
 addressable demand.

It can be observed that 59 percent of total commercial bank outstanding loans
to MSMEs are concentrated around five regions, with other regions individually
contributing to 1–2 percent of total MSMEs outstanding loans. Since many
enterprises are concentrated around these five regions, bank lending is high for
them (Section 3.8.).

4.2.2.	 Other Formal Sources of Financing

Other formal sources of financing in Indonesia can be broadly classified as MFI and
multifinance companies. The total estimated supply of finance to MSMEs from this
segment is IDR 298 trillion, with MFI providing IDR 233 trillion and multifinance
companies providing IDR 65 trillion.48

 4.2.2.1. Rural Banks

 Rural banks (BPR) are one of the key constituents of MFIs in Indonesia and are
 currently (as of 31 December 2013) regulated by BI (and by OJK from 1 January
 2014 onwards). These banks differ from commercial banks in their scope of services.
 For instance, rural banks cannot accept deposits in the form of demand deposit and
 participate in the payment traffic or conduct foreign exchange business operations
 other than as foreign exchange traders. Rural bank outstanding loans to the MSME
 segment amounted to IDR 26.2 trillion as of May 2013.

 BPRs lend around 47.6 percent of their total lending portfolio to the MSME sector,
 key reasons being large network, localized products and ease of accessibility for
 MSMEs. Unlike commercial banks, rural banks lend more to microenterprises (64
 percent of MSME lending) than they do to small enterprises (21 percent), with the
 balance of 15 percent to medium enterprises.

 4.2.2.1.1. Sharia-Based Rural Banks
 Rural banks can be segregated into conventional rural banks and Sharia-based rural
 banks. There are 159 Sharia-based rural banks operating under 399 branches across
 Indonesia. The outstanding loans to MSMEs constitute 60 percent49 of their portfolio,
 and as of May 2013 they contribute 9 percent of the total rural bank lending to MSMEs
 (average lending per Sharia rural bank is IDR 15 billion).

 Sharia-based rural banks have increased their lending portfolios towards MSMEs
 when compared to conventional rural banks. Portfolios of Sharia based BPRs
 increased at 32 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) against 13 percent
 for conventional rural banks. Rural Sharia banks have similar lending contracts as
 commercial banks and most lend under a profit sharing agreement with the borrower.
 This is further discussed in Section 4.3.2.1.

 4.2.2.1.2. Rural Bank Lending Sectoral Overview 50
 FIGURE 24: RURAL BANK BREAKDOWN FOR MSME, BY SECTOR, MAY 2013 (IDR
 TRILLION)51




 It can be observed from the above figure that, from a sector-based lending
 perspective, rural banks’ lending structure is no different from commercial bank
 lending, with the THR sector (trade, hotels, restaurants) again featuring as the
 leading sector for receiving finance.
 49 Islamic Banking Statistics, Bank Indonesia, July 2013.
 50 Since the MSME lending constitutes 92.4 percent of the total industrial lending, the sectoral split for the
 industrial lending and the MSME lending is assumed to be the same. It has been assumed that services include other
 and unidentified sectors.

It can be observed that around 74 percent of total outstanding loans are from five
locations, with all the provinces in Java (including DKI Jakarta) accounting for 61
percent of total outstanding loans. The remaining 26 percent are spread across
Indonesia. Geographically, the distribution of MSME lending is in line with the
distribution of enterprises in Indonesia (Section 3.8.).

4.2.2.2. Cooperatives

Cooperatives providing savings and loans facilities in Indonesia are structured to
provide both conventional lending as well as Sharia-based lending. Cooperatives
lend more than 90 percent53 (IDR 110 trillion) of their portfolio to MSMEs.
Cooperatives primarily lend to microenterprises since their loan sizes are small
(average IDR 10 million).

FIGURE 25 : STRUCTURE OF FINANCIAL COOPERATIVES 54




Cooperatives that are not registered to provide savings and lending services can
lend or provide savings facilities to their members by forming savings and loans
units (USP). Some cooperatives also lend to non-members depending on their type
of registration.

 Since the loans disbursed metrics is for half a year as of June 2013, the total lending of cooperatives
 in Indonesia can be estimated at IDR 110 trillion.

 Koperasi Simpan Pinjam (KSP) – KSPs, also known as savings and loans
 cooperatives, provide lending services to MSMEs, which are their members.
 Some KSPs are registered to provide lending services to non-members as
 well. The KSPs are in principle registered with the MCSME and are subject to a
 regulatory framework which includes minimum capital requirements, a sound
 rating system, and a loan classification system. The regulations however do not
 define legal lending limits and requirements for loan-loss provisioning. Also,
 these cooperatives are inadequately supervised and regulated post registration.

 Some KSPs are structured as credit unions (CU)/KOPDIT, enabling them to be
 a part of the world CU movement under the World Council of Credit Unions
 (WOCCU). There are more than 1,000 CUs in Indonesia, of which 937 are part
 of INKOPDIT, a private national apex body, overlooking the functioning of their
 members. CUs under INKOPDIT had outstanding loans of IDR 13.6 trillion as of
 September 2013, of which 80–90% is for MSME lending. The loans outstanding
 for these CUs have been growing at more than 20 percent annually.

 Islamic Cooperatives (KJKS) – Islamic cooperatives/Koperasi Jasa Keuangan
 Syariah (KJKS) are registered to provide savings and lending services under
 Sharia principles. Officially, Sharia cooperatives are referred to as KJKS, but
 the term BMT (Baitul Mal Wal-Tamwil) is also popularly used. The majority of
 the BMTs are registered and supported by Pusat Inkubasi Bisnis Usaha Kecil
 (PINBUK) established in 1995. PINBUK has no formal supervisory power
 over Islamic cooperatives, but helps them to scale and manage their lending
 services.

 Unit Simpan Pinjam (USP) – Producers and consumer cooperatives open
 USP to provide lending services to their members. USPs operate as separate
 business units under the existing cooperatives and provide consumptive and
 productive loans to their members.

Sharia Units (UJKS) – Usaha Jasa Keuangan Syariah (UJKS) are similar to USP, the only
difference being that UJKS provides lending and saving services as per Sharia principles.

4.2.2.3. Pawnshops

Pawnshops provide secured loans to the borrowers, with items of personal property used
as collateral. Pawnshops essentially work on the lending structure based on retaining
the physical possession of asset collateralized. In Indonesia, pawnshops provide both
conventional lending services as well as Sharia-based lending services. They provide movable
finance based on collateral ranging from gold jewelry/precious stones, vehicles (cars/
motorcycles), electronics, fabric and other home appliances (Figure 26).

PT Pegadaian, a state-owned pawnshop, is the largest pawning institution in Indonesia,
covering more than 80 percent56 (including Sharia-based lending) of total market of IDR 6
trillion. The company provides pawning and fiduciary services, both conventionally or under
Sharia principles, mostly dedicated to middle – low income members of society, and MSMEs.
PT Pegadaian has a total portfolio of IDR 446 billion under its fiduciary lending services.
Interest charged ranges from 1.5–2.4 percent flat per month for a four-month loan, whereas
for a fiduciary loan the interest rate charged is 1 percent flat per month for a one year tenor
loan. This business model seems to be finding significant favor amongst the female section
of the society and approximately 80 percent of its customers are women. The portfolio
distribution for PT Pegadaian is highlighted in Figure 27.

 Pawnshops buy insurance cover from PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia and PT
 Askrindo at 2 percent annual premium. This insurance covers up to 80 percent
 of the net loss in case of default i.e. after collateral execution. Pawnshops have a
 non-performing loan (NPL) limit of 2 percent of their portfolio. As pawnshops
 have physical possession of collateral, the enforcement process is problem free.
 In case of default, the collateral is sold through public auctions.

 4.2.2.4. Venture Capital Firms

 In 1995 the Ministry of Finance issued a regulation57 recognizing venture
 capital as a special field of activity in the financial sector. The estimated
 financing to MSMEs is IDR 2 trillion58. Venture capital firms provide collateral-
 free lending to MSMEs based on a profit sharing model. In the profit sharing
 model they provide capital to micro and small business through a pre-agreed
 profit sharing agreement. There were a total of 86 venture capital companies in
 Indonesia as of 2011.

 4.2.2.5. Other Financial Institutions

 Other FIs supplying loans to MSMEs include rural credit association (LDKPs, LPDs
 in Bali), and non-government organization (NGO) cooperatives financing MSMEs.

 •	 Rural Credit Associations – Rural credit associations/Lembaga Dana
    Kredit Pedesaan (LDKPs) provide savings and lending services to MSMEs
    (like BPRs, but they are supervised by local government). LDKPs are spread
    across Central Java, Yogyakarta and Bali. LDKPs in Bali are known as LPDs
    (Lembaga Perkreditan Desa).

 •	 Despite competition from local formal and informal lending institutes, LPDs
    are successful under the LDKP system in Indonesia. LPDs receive much
    technical assistance from the US Agency for International Development
    (USAID) and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit
    (GIZ). Unlike LDKPs, LPDs are not regulated by the Government but owned
    by local community organizations.

•	 NGO Cooperatives – Many NGOs in Indonesia, in order to extend
   microcredit to MSMEs, have taken the form of cooperatives. NGOs
   conducting microfinance require no permission to extend credit, and there
   are no reporting requirements or supervisory arrangements for such
   activities. However, NGOs are forbidden to mobilize the savings of members
   unless these are deposited directly with a regulated FI.

One such NGO involved in microfinance activities is Yayasan Bina Swadaya.
Bina Swadaya helps in the formation and training of self help groups (SHGs) for
official and donor-supported microfinance programs. Bina Swadaya has also
purchased a number of BPRs to which it links SHGs. It has formed a cooperative
which attracts deposits from a middle-class population and lends to the poor.

4.2.2.6. Multifinance Companies

In Indonesia “multifinance” companies engage in a range of “near banking
activities”, such as credit card financing, leasing, consumer finance and
factoring. There are about 195 multifinance companies, regulated by OJK.

Originally multifinance companies were engaged in leasing but in 2005
nearly 70 percent60 of their activity was in consumer finance, with leasing
accounting for most of the remainder. Leasing activity mainly pertains to large
corporations while MSMEs get credit though consumer finance and factoring.
With respect to consumer financing, multifinance companies generally
provide automobile and motorcycle financing to low-income segments of the
population.61 For the purpose of the study, consumer financing and factoring
business have been studied.

4.2.2.6.1. Consumer Financing

Total consumer financing in Indonesia is IDR 20562 trillion as of May 2013, of
which 30 percent63 (IDR 60 trillion) is estimated to be used by MSMEs and the
remaining for consumptive purposes.

 Jakarta has the biggest share of consumer goods financing with market share of
 23 percent (IDR 13.8 trillion) of total consumer financing, since it is a densely
 populated region with a high demand for vehicle and car financing. Other areas
 with significant market share are West Java (16 percent), East Java (9 percent)
 and Central Java (8 percent).

 4.2.2.6.2. Factoring

 Factoring as part of total lending in Indonesia is at a nascent stage, with only
 IDR 5.4 trillion (around 0.6 percent of total formal lending) outstanding loans
 to MSME segment in 2013. Companies/individuals that assign their accounts
 receivable to financing companies are the clients of the factoring business.
 The assignment of accounts receivable is conducted to improve their financial
 liquidity.

 Prior to the financial crisis of 1998, around 30 percent65 of the total receivables
 were factored. During the crisis a large proportion of the receivable became
 insolvent and resulted in huge losses for FIs. This resulted in FIs becoming risk
 averse and reducing their factoring portfolio.

 TRILLION) 66




 FIGURE 30: SHARE OF FACTORING PER BUSINESS SECTOR (2009 – 2011)67




 Factoring financing is dominated by non-financial services companies. Finance,
 rent and services constituted the highest market share sector-wise in 2011 at
 39 percent. The factoring market is concentrated in the administrative center,
 namely DKI Jakarta (76 percent of the market in 2011). This is due to the nature
 of the factoring financing business in which the decision to assign the client’s
 receivables is still centralized at headquarters/head office. Meanwhile, West Java

is the only other region that receives a financing share of more than IDR 150
billion; other regions have a factoring business of less than IDR 150 billion.

4.2.3. Total Formal Flow of Financing

The estimated formal supply of financing to the MSME sector in Indonesia is
IDR 857 trillion, of which commercial banks contribute 65 percent (IDR 559
trillion68); the remaining amount is contributed by other formal sources like
rural banks, cooperatives, pawnshops, venture capital companies, consumer
finance companies, factoring companies and other formal institutions.

FIGURE 31: TOTAL FORMAL SUPPLY OF FINANCING TO MSMEs (IDR

68 As mentioned in Indonesian’s Experiences on Micro Finance Institution and Small Scale Cross Border
Transaction, ADBI-AFDC-ABAC “Asia-Pacific Forum on Financial Inclusion, June 2012, banking channel of
financing contributes to 65% of total formal sources, hence 35% is assumed to be contributed by other
formal sources such as rural banks, cooperatives, pawnshops, venture capital companies, consumer
finance companies, factoring companies and other formal institutions.

                                                                                                        44

 (IDR TRILLION)69




 As we have seen in the above sections, FIs prefer lending to the trade, hotels
 and restaurants sector than to agriculture, due to visible cash flows and faster
 recovery of loans.

 More than 90 percent of respondents are reluctant to lend to the fisheries sector,
 followed by livestock. To address risks of those businesses, BI has recently started
 developing a cattle insurance product and guidelines for lending for small boats
 (less than 20 cubic meters).

 Some banks are also reluctant to extend their lending portfolio to upstream
 forestry and plantation-related businesses. Key reasons for constraints to sectoral
 lending are:

      a) Seasonality of business (fisheries) – The fisheries business is seasonal
      in nature and so lenders are wary of the long-term cash flow of the business
      and uncertain business cycles. Furthermore, since most of the borrowers are
      often at sea to make their catch, the lenders tend to avoid fishermen and this
      sector.
      b) Migrant workers (fisheries) – In fisheries, the majority of the workers
      are not local residents, hence it is difficult for FIs to assess the credit
      worthiness of the borrower.
      c) Higher gestation cycle (upstream plantation and forestry) –
      Upstream businesses like forestry have a higher gestation period, adding to
      the risks and making business cash flows uncertain.

 69 Commercial bank’s and rural bank’s sectorial break-down was available at, Indonesian Banking Statistics,
 May 2013, Bank Indonesia. Other formal financial institutions’ sectorial break-down has been calculated
 based on primary survey results and extrapolations.

+Data of commercial banks and rural banks for MSME lending not available prior to 2011, since MSME loans prior
to 2011 also included retail segment loans.
++Since rural bank NPL data for MSME lending is not available, the overall rural banks NPL is assumed to be the
same for MSMEs.
It has been assumed that the total NPL for respective lease financing and factoring financing industry is the same
for MSME lending.

It can be observed that the NPL ratios for commercial banks have been relatively
constant as compared to those of NBFIs, which show a decreasing trend over the
period. Lending by NBFIs is relatively new in the Indonesian context, and NBFIs
are still learning to manage their risk effectively.

4.3. Lending Models of Supply Stakeholders

MSMEs receive formal financing largely through four key channels - commercial
banks, rural banks, cooperatives and venture capital companies (VCs), and NBFIs
(consumer financing and factoring).

 4.3.1.	 Commercial Bank Lending Model

 Commercial banks in Indonesia lend to MSMEs either directly or through
 institutional lending and linkage programs with rural banks, cooperatives and
 VCs. Direct lending to MSMEs is in the form of MSME and micro direct loans,
 warehouse receipt financing and supply chain financing.

 FIGURE 34: COMMERCIAL BANK LENDING MODEL




 4.3.1.1. Direct Lending

 Commercial banks lend to MSMEs either through bank branches or through
 smaller bank units set up in rural areas.

 4.3.1.1.1. MSME Direct Loans

 Commercial banks lend to MSMEs through branch banking, by providing
 working capital and investment capital loans. Various banks have their own
 internal definitions of loan sizes for MSME loans. The range of lending for micro
 enterprises is less than IDR 100 million, small enterprises is IDR 100 million–5
 billion, and for medium enterprises IDR 5– 50 billion.

 Commercial banks provide both conventional loans and Sharia-based loans to
 MSMEs. According to the conventional lending model, the loans are provided
 based on interest rates, whereas under Sharia-banking the borrower enters into a
 contract with the lender either to share profits or for lease purchase.

                                                   repay the amount borrowed.

Approximately 27 percent of MSME lending by Sharia commercial banks is on
the profit sharing model (Musyarakah financing is 20.2 percent and Mudharabah
financing is 7.3 percent) whereas the buy-sell model (Murabahah) accounts for
around 60 percent of MSME lending72, since negotiations of the profit sharing
terms is a time-consuming process and more risky as compared to fix margin
based business under the buy-sell model.

4.3.1.1.2. Bank Micro Unit

Bank micro units are small bank offices in rural areas that disburse microloans to
MSMEs. They operate under the supervision of sub-branch offices of commercial
banks and are equipped with account officers with the regional knowledge. Bank
micro units are often used to channel KUR loans to MSMEs, which is discussed in
subsequent sections of this report.

Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) through its 5,000 micro units called Unit Desa
has been successful in providing microfinance to MSMEs. The number of micro
loans outstanding in 2012 reached IDR 115.16 trillion, or 33 percent73 of BRI’s
total loans. In order to improve lending, BRI has adopted a policy to increase the
number of account officers per Unit Desa (from 2.01 in 2011 to 3.09 in 2012).

4.3.1.1.3. Linkage Programs

In order to meet MSME lending targets, commercial banks have two types of
linkage programs, channeling and executing, with rural banks and cooperatives.
These programs help commercial banks to increase their reach in rural areas and
are more cost efficient since they save on administrative, marketing, and credit

 collection personnel costs. Under the channeling program the funds for MSME
 lending are routed through MFIs, whereas under the executing program the MFIs
 take the loans on their books and further lend to MSMEs.

 Commercial banks prefer to lend to those BPRs which actually do not need funds
 for MSME lending (on an average 50 percent74 of commercial bank loans to these
 BPRs are unutilized). Further, commercial banks spend considerable time and
 cost due to lack of comprehensive information on what BPRs to target for this
 program.

 4.3.1.2. Collateral Preference of Banks

 Banks prefer their lending to be collateralized, with more than 90 percent of
 the commercial bank respondents of this study have been doing collateralized
 lending only. Banks require the value of collateral to be more than 130 percent of
 the value of the loan. In the case of preferential clients, however, banks do lend
 if the collateral value is smaller than the loan value. Banks manage their risks
 by availing credit insurance (up to 70 percent of the loan value) on the loan. The
 insurance premium (3–5 percent of the loan coverage value) is borne by the
 debtor.

 Commercial banks prefer fixed collateral such as land and buildings with a
 loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80 percent. For collateralizing these assets banks
 require the property registration and property tax related documents. But in
 certain cases, banks use their discretion to relax documentation requirements, as
 explained below:

     a) In the case of hereditary land, where the title of the land is still in the name
        of the family member, a letter from the village head stating the ownership of
        the land is accepted as collateral by the bank.
     b) If the asset is owned by the spouse, the marriage certificate is also accepted
        by the bank as collateral.

 Though acceptance of a letter from the village head, marriage certificates and
 education certificates does not attribute to the capacity to pay, it does however
 have psychological impact on willingness to pay.

 Banks also accept movable collateral like motor vehicles, cash, gold and inventory.
 Movable assets such as motor vehicles are the most preferred collateral with LTV
 of around 30–80 percent depending on the age of vehicle. Inventory is generally
 not preferred due to complexities in valuation and management of the collateral.

FIGURE 35: COMMERCIAL BANK COLLATERAL REQUIREMENT




Banks such as BTPN have identified the unavailability of collateral documents or
the collateral itself to be a significant challenge, especially for microenterprises. In
such cases, uncollateralized lending is provided for a loan of between IDR 5 and
50 million, but at a higher interest rate of 35–45 percent (effective rate). While the
business risks are higher, the perception is that these unsecured lending programs
will help develop relationships with microenterprises before they graduate to small
or medium enterprises.

Accounts receivable as collateral is only accepted for institutional lending and
linkage programs from banks to MFIs, since this can be conveniently managed by
banks. Bank Andara has developed a large part of their business model around
lending to MFIs with more than 85 percent of loan secured through accounts
receivable.

4.3.1.3. KUR

As a part of the GoI’s objectives to promote bank lending to MSMEs, credit guarantee
has been provided by the GoI since 2007 for MSME loans under the Kredit Usaha
Rakyat (KUR) scheme. Central guarantee companies like Askrindo and Perum
Jamkrindo (formerly Perum SPU) and regional guarantee companies in Bali and East
Java have been assigned by the GoI to provide the credit guarantee for the scheme.

This scheme is currently managed by 33 commercial banks including 26 BPDs. It is
implemented by commercial banks through either lending directly to the MSME or
through linkage programs.

FIGURE 36: KUR LENDING MODEL




                                                                                           50
 The objectives of the KUR program are to accelerate the development of primary
 sectors and empower small-scale businesses; to improve accessibility to credit
 and FIs; to reduce poverty levels; and to expand job opportunities. With the GoI
 providing a guarantee for the loans, the risk to of repayment on such loans is
 reduced.

 KUR is a financing facility that can be accessed by MSMEs, especially those that have
 good prospects and the ability to repay but are not yet bankable. Currently, there
 are two schemes which are a part of the KUR program:

       a) KUR Micro - Working capital or investment capital loan (productive use)
          with loan size up to IDR 20 million. An interest rate of maximum 22 percent
          effective is charged under the scheme by the banks with no collateral
          requirement.
       b) KUR Retail - Working capital or investment capital loan (productive use)
          with the loan size between IDR 20 million and IDR 500 million. An interest
          rate of maximum 13 percent effective is charged under the scheme by the
          banks with a collateral requirement of 30 percent.

 As of May 2013, total credit outstanding under KUR from commercial banks was
 IDR 43.8 trillion. It is important to note that outstanding loan in KUR schemes has
 been already included as a part of the total commercial bank outstanding.

 As can be observed in Table 15 above, though the overall NPL under the KUR
 scheme is 3.8 percent, there is a huge variance of the NPL rate individually amongst
 banks. The GoI has recently set a NPL target for banks at 5 percent.

51
4.3.1.3.2. KUR Targets

FIGURE 37: KUR DISBURSEMENT VERSUS TARGET (IDR TRILLION)




It is important to understand that at current levels KUR-based lending forms
only 7.8 percent of total MSME lending by commercial banks. Also, banks have
been exceeding the KUR targets set by the GoI consistently for the last three
years. Commercial banks have also shown willingness to lend more under the
KUR scheme if permitted by the GoI. Government is currently constrained by the
financial capacities of participating guarantee companies and is taking steps to
improve its KUR targets. The key initiatives taken are:

   a) Infusion of equity in central guarantee companies – Government has set
      aside IDR 2 trillion to infuse as equity in national credit guarantee companies,
      Jamkrido and Askrindo, depending on their performance. Infusion of equity
      will help the guarantee companies to increase their total portfolio and to take
      on additional risks.
   b) New credit guarantee companies at regional level – Government has
      planned to set up regional guarantee companies (PT Jamkrida Riau, PT
      Jamkrida NTB Bersaing, PT Jamkrida West Java, and PT Jamkrida West
      Sumatera) to increase MSME financing.

4.3.1.3.3. Collateral Requirement in KUR

The KUR scheme was launched with the intention of providing uncollateralized
loans to MSMEs, but in practice, the executing banks ask for collateral while lending.
KUR microloans of less than IDR 20 million, even though theoretically collateral-
free, are subject to collateral of 30–70 percent of the loan value.

The scheme is further secured by credit guarantee companies providing a loan
guarantee of 70 percent (for downstream) to 80 percent (for upstream) of the loan
value, for which the premium is paid by the GoI. Thus, on an average, KUR loans are
secured for 130–150 percent of the loan value, which in principle is contradictory
to the program objective of providing uncollateralized lending under KUR.
Additionally, in the case of on-lending to rural banks, commercial banks insist on
100 percent collateral requirement under the scheme.

4.3.1.4. Warehouse Receipt Financing

The warehouse receipt is a certificate of title over commodities stored in a
warehouse issued by the warehouse manager. Financing is provided against this
collateral by commercial banks for a period of 3–6 months.
                                                                                         52
 4.3.1.4.1. The Warehouse Receipt Law

 The Warehouse Receipt Law76 was enacted in 2006 to address demand of
 warehouse receipt-based financing. This law gave flexibility to producers to sell
 their goods only when the market prices are right. The law was amended in 201177
 to bring clarity on the pricing of commodities stored in warehouses and inclusion of
 new commodities against which warehouse receipts could be issued. The significant
 amendment in this law included removal of the clause which stated that the value of
 the goods in the warehouse would be equal to the market price of the goods at the
 time of storage. This law also calls for formation of a warehouse receipts guarantee
 institution, which would play a significant role in deciding the damages related to
 loss or damage of goods during storage. The Warehouse Receipt Law in Indonesia
 currently allows receipts to be issued against nine crops only, namely rice, paddy,
 corn, coffee, cocoa, pepper, rubber, seaweed and rattan.

 4.3.1.4.2. Process of Warehouse Financing

 FIGURE 38: WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS FINANCING PROCESS




 Step 1: The owner of the goods (farmers/farmers’ group/farmers group and
         cooperative) transfers the good to the warehouse. The warehouse manager
         and/or an external surveyor evaluate(s) the quality of the produce.

 Step 2: The quality and quantity of the goods define the price of the commodity
         which is agreed upon by the warehouse manager, the owner and the FI
         providing financing. The warehouse manager then issues the warehouse
         receipt after registration in the Indonesian Derivative Clearing House (PT
         Kliring Berjangka Indonesia)

 Step 3: Following the issuance of the warehouse receipt, the owner of the goods
         applies for warehouse receipt credit at the participating FI.

 Step 4: The FI performs the following credit check operations before approving
         the loan:

 76 Law no. 9 of 2006
 77 Law no. 9 of 2011

53
  a) Banks conduct a survey of goods at the warehouse. This operation is either
     performed independently or with the help of independent surveying agencies
     such as PT Superintending Company of Indonesia (Persero) (SUCOFINDO).
  b) Post survey, the bank verifies from PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia if any other
     FI has imposed a guarantee on the warehouse receipt.

Step 5: Credit disbursement procedures are as follows:
        a) The FI proceeds to impose a guarantee (i.e. register) on the warehouse
           receipt with PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia.
        b) Post registration, the credit is disbursed to the borrower.

Step 6: When commodity prices are favorable, the owner sells the goods by
        entering into a sale-purchase agreement with the buyer (trader).

Step 7: Upon entering into the agreement, the trader pays the FI the value of the
        goods.

Step 8: The bank in turn issues an order to the warehouse manager to release the
       goods to the trader, following the consent of the owner of the goods.

Step 9: The warehouse manager releases the goods to the trader.

4.3.1.4.3. Warehouse Receipt Schemes

In Indonesia, warehouse receipt financing operates under two schemes, subsidized
and non-subsidized. The subsidy is provided by the GoI in order to promote credit
to farmers.

                                   1 month before expiry

4.3.1.4.4. Current Status of Warehouse Receipts

Warehouse receipt financing is less than 1 percent78 of a commercial bank’s
portfolio, with only some banks (Bank Jatim and Bank BRI) involved in lending
against warehouse receipts. While currently only nine commodities are allowed by
GoI to be used under warehouse receipt law, banks also finance other commodities,
such as tea, through warehouse financing.

78 Five percent of the total financial institutions interviewed had some portfolio (less than 1 percent) of finance
based on warehouse receipts.




                                                                                                                      54
 Foreign banks are active in this market, with HSBC and Rabobank providing pre-
 shipment warehouse financing, for export and import transactions. Basically the
 goods are sold and warehouse financing is provided for the period the goods are
 still at the docks. This type of facility is beneficial for an exporter who is unable to
 provide collateral in the form of fixed assets but has a significant inventory to obtain
 the working capital financing in order to facilitate business activities.

 4.3.1.4.5. Challenges in Warehouse Receipt Financing

     a) Limited business knowledge: Limited business knowledge to operate
        warehouse receipt transactions has been cited as a major reason for banks
        not entering into this business. This is evident from the fact that very few
        domestic banks are involved in warehouse receipt financing, and those who
        are have a very insignificant portfolio.

     b) Limited warehouse facilities: Industry and farmer associations have
       highlighted insufficient limited warehouse facilities as a key challenge in
       increasing penetration of warehouse receipt based financing. Conversely, the
       current warehouse operators are battling with the problem of overcapacity
       in terms of infrastructure readiness. The GoI is taking some steps to increase
       the number of warehouses in Indonesia.

     c) High cost of services for small farmers: Currently, the ancillary cost
        of availing warehouse receipt based financing is very high. Costs involve
        warehouse cost and surveyor agency for fixing price of commodities.

 4.3.1.5.	Supply Chain Financing

 Supply chain financing (SCF) refers to a range of financing and business processes
 that provide short-term credit to optimize working capital throughout the supply
 chain for both buyers and sellers.

 SCF works exactly like reverse factoring and comprises the following main
 processes:

     a) A company purchases goods from a supplier. The supplier submits an invoice
        to the company.
     b) The purchasing company approves the invoice. This creates an irrevocable
        payment obligation for the purchasing company.
     c) Through a pre-established relationship between the supplier and the buyer’s
        FI, the supplier may request funding of the approved payable at a date before
        the receivable’s actual payable date.
     d) When the official payment date of the invoice arrives, the FI collects the
        payment from the purchasing company.

 In Indonesia, SCF has recently been introduced with Deutsche Bank and PT
 Carrefour Indonesia entering into an agreement to finance Carrefour’s strategic
 suppliers. Other banks, such as Bank BTPN, Bank BNI and SBI Indonesia, are
 contemplating launching similar services.

4.3.2.	 MFI Lending Models

MFIs lending to MSMEs include rural banks (BPRs), cooperatives and VCs. The
lending by these MFIs is done through individual lending and group lending models.

FIGURE 39: MFI LENDING MODEL




* Some Cooperatives also accept deposits	
^ From international Agencies and Government


4.3.2.1.	MFI Lending Sectoral Overview

More than 70 percent of the MFI portfolio is concentrated around microlending.
As for commercial banks, MFIs also prefer lending to the THR sector (trade, hotels,
restaurants) due to the sector’s smaller business cycles and more visible cash flows.

FIGURE 40: MFI PORTFOLIO BREAKDOWN




MFIs also lend according to Sharia-based banking practices. Under Sharia-based
loans, an MFI usually enter into a buy-sell model (Murabahah), rather than a
profit sharing contract (Mudharabah or Musyarakah) since Sharia MFIs prefer
short-term financing instead of long-term profit sharing agreements, considering
the risk profile of MSMEs. Further framing and execution of such contracts is
time consuming. Negotiation of profit sharing terms with the borrowers adds
additional time since financial statements of the borrowers are not updated, or
are frequently missing.



                                                                                        56
 4.3.2.2.	Average Loan Sizes

 Cooperatives provide small loans of up to IDR 10 million, whereas MSMEs approach
 BPRs for a larger ticket size of loans. BPRs also provide small and medium sized
 loans to MSMEs, where medium sized loans are sometimes arranged through loan
 syndication with other BPRs in the region (Table 17).

 TABLE 17: AVERAGE LOAN SIZES FOR LENDING

         Average Ticket Size of Loans                               Range
         Micro Loans by Cooperative                            IDR 10 million

             Micro Loans by BPRs                             IDR 10–50 million

             Small Loans by BPRs                            IDR 50–150 million
            Medium Loans by BPRs                           IDR 150– 500 million


 4.3.2.3.	Individual Lending

 Under individual lending, MFIs lend to the borrower based on her/his credit
 worthiness. Loans are disbursed once the loan officer establishes the borrower’s
 capacity to repay the loan. Loan officers have a good understanding of the client and
 local lending practices. The individual lending model relies on detailed assessment
 of the client’s financial and economic information gathered and analyzed by the
 loan officer. Loan decisions are individually tailored based on the specific needs of
 each applicant and are usually made after the visit of a loan officer to the house and
 workplace of the client. Loans disbursed are tracked routinely by the loan officer
 who ensures timely repayments.

 Cooperatives, specifically CUs, generally provide training to first time borrowers
 for three to six months and insist that the borrower regularly attends the training
 program, failing which the loan may even be rejected. Future loans are processed
 within a week, once the credit worthiness on past borrowing is established.
 Cooperatives require members to maintain a savings account with them which acts
 as cash collateral to cover their risk.

 4.3.2.4.	Group Lending

 Group lending is the disbursement of loans through groups of customers. The
 group lending model enables the borrowers to access uncollateralized credit. This
 model of lending is exercised by cooperatives and VCs (but less than 10 percent79 of
 cooperatives and VCs use the group lending model). It has been observed that most
 of the beneficiaries of group lending models are female business owners.

 79 Numbers and conclusions are drawn from the primary survey of this study.




57
FIGURE 41: GROUP LENDING STRUCTURE




Group members are chosen by the customers themselves, with the average group
size ranging from five to 10 members. The members join a group to share the
liability of a loan together. In case a member defaults within a group, the group is
legally responsible for her/his payments. In case a group defaults on a large loan,
the center which overlooks the functioning of several groups in the region makes
up for the default. In this way, the risk of default is spread to a wider range of
borrowers and works as an effective control mechanism on the NPL rates.

Group members initially obtain small loans with a duration ranging from one month
to one year. The amount disbursed usually follows a staggered lending approach;
larger loans are disbursed when previous amounts are repaid. This approach gives
an incentive to repay and allows the FI to build a credit history for every group as
well as for individual clients. Installments are generally on a weekly or monthly
cycle and repayments are guaranteed collectively.

Other important components are regular meetings of the group members, training,
and compulsory savings which act as a collateral for the cooperative lending to
the member. The members are encouraged to undergo training in order to be a
part of the group. These trainings, in which the members are informed about the
loan application and loan servicing procedures, range from three to four months.
Members are trained to service their loans and keep a check on other members in
case of default.

4.3.2.5.	Credit Disbursement Mechanism

•	 Branch/Office Banking – Rural banks prefer to use branches to disburse cash,
   since this brings borrowers into direct visible contact and also avoids possibility
   of cash embezzlement.

     Rural banks also set up cash offices which have a smaller infrastructure when
     compared to a branch, and are used solely for the purpose of disbursing loans
     and collection of monthly installments. As of May 2013, there were 1,527 cash
     offices belonging to 1,641 rural banks80 in Indonesia. This shows that on an
     average every rural bank has one cash office, apart from the main branch and
80 Indonesian Banking Statistics, May 2013, Bank Indonesia.




                                                                                         58
         sub-branch office to service loans. Establishment of new cash offices has been
         cited as one of the major ways to increase MSME lending.

     •	 Account/Loan Officer – Account/loan officers are generally used by rural
        banks and cooperatives to seek new clients and assess the credit worthiness of
        the borrower by conducting a background check. They disburse loans especially
        in the case of group lending, where the borrower cannot travel to the office of
        the cooperative, and the loan amounts are relatively small.

     4.3.2.6.	Collateral Preference of MFIs

     MFIs prefer immovable collateral such as land and buildings and restrict movable
     asset based lending only to cars and motorcycles (Figure 42).

     Figure 42: MFI PREFERENCE OF COLLATERAL (PERCENTAGE OF
     RESPONDENTS)




     Other types of movable collateral include accounts receivable, livestock, consumer
     durables, and inventory

     The majority of the respondents (FIs), cited lack of business know-how and
     complications with on-the-ground management of movable collateral other than
     vehicles as a major barrier for movable collateral based financing. It was established
     that:

         a) BPRs collateralize 100 percent of their loan and prefer fixed assets collateral.
            Cars and motorcycles are the only movable collateral accepted by BPRs.
         b) Uncollaterized loans as a part of the BPR portfolio are very insignificant, and
            are given only to preferential clients who have a successful track record of
            servicing loans.
         c) In the case of cooperatives, besides land-based assets, they provide financing
            on vehicles (cars and motorcycles). Some cooperatives also provide lending
            on inventory (like livestock, stones, and plants), marriage certificates,
            education certificates, consumer durables and accounts receivable.
         d) Cooperatives and VCs, under the group lending model, provide
            uncollateralized lending but insist on members depositing savings with
            them. These savings act as cash collateral and are approximately 1/3 the
            size of the loan. Even CUs use only cash collateral (20–30 percent of the loan
            value) for smaller loans (less than IDR 50 million).


59
Further, the requirement for collateral varies across provinces, with Bali having a
higher proportion of uncollaterized loans and West and East Java having a low risk
appetite for uncollaterized lending. Cultural differences were highlighted as one of
the important reasons for such a trend.

4.3.3.	 NBFI Lending Models

NBFI/multifinance companies in Indonesia lend to MSMEs through consumer
finance channeling and factoring.

FIGURE 43: NBFI LENDING MODEL




4.3.3.1.	Consumer Financing

NBFIs are predominantly involved in consumer financing especially vehicle
financing. In Indonesia, NBFIs are restricted from providing financing to MSMEs
using their existing asset as collateral, and can only finance purchase of assets.

NBFIs use the refinancing model in order to provide collateral-based financing to
MSMEs. The key steps in the model are:

  a) The borrower sells the old vehicle to the third party company, a sister concern
     of the NBFI, for an agreed value.
  b) Funds received by the borrower through the sale of the vehicle are used to
     purchase the vehicle back from the third party. Typically 30 percent of the
     value is given as down payment to purchase back the vehicle. The remaining
     70 percent of the loan amount is paid by the NBFI to the third party.
  c) The borrower services the loan to the NBFI through monthly payments and
     interest on the loan.




                                                                                       60
 FIGURE 44: REFINANCING MODEL




 Bank lending constitutes 80 percent of the NBFI sources of fund. Banks allow their
 funds to be used only for consumer finance of vehicles and at times equipment, but
 not for warehouse financing or factoring.

 NBFIs mostly lend to the trade, hotels and restaurants sector followed by the
 agriculture sector, and tend to avoid the fisheries and mining sectors. In terms of
 portfolio contribution, MSMEs constitute 50–70 percent of the NBFI lending portfolio.

 4.3.3.2.	Factoring

 Factoring is a working capital financing method for MSMEs, whereby the accounts
 receivable are discounted by the NBFI (factor), increasing liquidity for MSMEs.

 FIGURE 45: FACTORING MODEL IN INDONESIA




     a) MSMEs sell goods on credit and raises invoice for the same.
     b) This invoice is discounted by the factor, after deducting certain fees and
        interest, and money is disbursed to the MSME. The factor releases only
        70–90 percent of the invoice amount and retains the balance so as to keep
        the client obligated towards any future default on the part of the buyer of the
        goods, return of goods, etc.




61
    c) The factor in turn recovers the outstanding amount from the buyer ofthe
       goods once the due date arrives, settles the remaining balance after
       deducting the discounted percentage (usually between 3–5 percent of invoice
       value) with the MSME, and completes the transaction.

In Indonesia before the 1998 financial crisis, around 30 percent of receivables used to
be factored, but this became significantly reduced due to risk aversion of the FIs. The
factoring industry has grown at CAGR of 50 percent in the last two years (2010–12).

4.4. Interest Rates across Lenders

Typically, commercial banks act as bankers for other FIs which further add their
operational charges and risk premium before on-lending to MSMEs. This increases
the cost of funds for MSMEs when borrowing from other FIs.

As highlighted in Figure 46, there is a positive correlation between the interest rates
charged by various FIs and the NPL rates they carry on their books. Interest rates
are also dependent on loan collateralization.

Commercial and rural banks with fixed asset based loans are more effective in
managing risk, thereby commanding a lower interest rate. Cooperatives and VCs
with a higher proportion of uncollateralized loans charge a higher interest rate
to cover their risks. Though pawnshops maintain the physical possession of the
collateral, they should be seen as an exception to this phenomenon as they charge a
premium for faster disbursement of loans.

FIGURE 46: INTEREST RATES AND NPL ACROSS LENDERS




    a) Bank units of commercial banks provide competitive rates for MSME credit, 	
       while maintaining NPL rates in an acceptable range.
    b) One of the main reasons for bank units providing competitive rates is the
       loan management services of commercial banks involving the supervision of
       loans by experienced loan officers. Experienced loan officers are prudent in
       lending to microenterprises and keep a regular check on loan repayment.
    c) Pawnshops are able to maintain a low NPL rate since they take the physical
       possession of the collateral.

                                                                                          62
     5. Estimating the Demand Supply Gap
     5.1. Demand Supply Gap

     FIGURE 47: DEMAND SUPPLY GAP (IDR TRILLION) 81




     As per the current estimates, the demand-supply gap stands at about IDR 3,826.5
     trillion. It should however be noted that the demand estimates also include MSMEs
     who though eligible for debt financing prefer to self-finance (around 10 percent).
     Additionally, there would be a significant portion of the demand that would
     be getting addressed through informal sources of financing. For this study, the
     informal sources of financing and self-financing have not been considered, as they
     still represent a gap which can be addressed by the formal sources of finance.

     For designing appropriate sector specific financing products, it is important to
     understand the financing gap for each of the financing sectors.

     FIGURE 48: SECTOR SPECIFIC FINANCING GAP (IDR TRILLION)82




     A few sectors including electricity, gas and water supply, and finance, rent and
     services seem to have a minimal or negative demand supply gap. This may be
     due to under-estimation of sales and assets for this sector or over-estimation
     of supply especially from other formal sources. Currently warehouse financing

has not been considered in this analysis. The market for warehouse receipt
financing is developing, but the lack of business understanding among various FIs
and the perceived complexities of receipt financing have kept the portfolio very
insignificant.

FIGURE 49: GAP BETWEEN DEMAND AND FORMAL SUPPLY (IDR TRILLION) 83




The amount of loan by sector at different LTVs is presented in Figure 50.
This amount is compared with the total demand of financing to give a better
understanding of the barrier.

                                                                                                                    64
 5.2. Need for Movable Financing

 According to an ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration85,
 around 86 percent of the MSMEs surveyed believed that lack of collateral was a
 barrier to financial access. MSMEs have very limited fixed assets to offer as collateral.
 The assets are usually offered as collateral for term loans, leaving the MSMEs with
 limited options to avail of working capital finance.

 Most of the financial capital of MSMEs is tied up in inventories, customer receivables
 and other movable securities. In case of enterprise in the agriculture or animal
 husbandry sector, the capital is tied up in standing crops and livestock.

 Conservatively, around 70 percent86 of a firm’s gross sales are movable assets (such
 as inventory, accounts receivable, cash collateral) in the firm’s balance sheet at any
 point in time. After estimating the sector level movable assets, movable assets based
 lending for various LTV ratios was simulated.

 FIGURE 51: COMPARISON BETWEEN MOVABLE COLLATERAL BASED LOAN AND
 TOTAL DEMAND AT DIFFERENT LTVS (IDR TRILLION) 87




 Except for the construction sector, the demand of finance for all the other sectors
 could be met by movable asset based financing even at LTVs as low as 35–40 percent.
 Therefore, to improve financial access for MSMEs, it is important to accept movable
 assets as collateral as this would help significantly reduce the demand-supply gap.

 6. Challenges in Lending
 To understand the key reason for the huge gap between demand of debt capital
 and the formal sources of lending, it is important to understand the process of
 lending and challenges faced by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and
 financial institutions (FIs) in each stage of the process.

 6.1. Lending Process

 TABLE 18: LENDING PROCESS FOR MSMEs FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS




 The overall lending process consists of five steps: loan application, loan approval,
 loan disbursement, loan management and collateral execution in case of default.
 The loan management process is not discussed as it is the bank’s internal process
 independent of external agencies.

 6.1.1. Loan Application

 As a starting point of the value chain in the whole lending cycle, an MSME
 approaches an FI to meet its financing requirement. Based on discussions with the
 loan officer, the MSME provides the relevant documentation such as the application
 form along with the details about its business including legal registration status,
 business licenses, financial statements, cash flow projections, utilization details of
 the loan, and information related to its suppliers and customers. In case the loan
 is more than IDR 50 million, Bank Indonesia (BI) mandates commercial and rural
 banks to collect tax registration certificates.

 Depending on the type of loan and relationship between the FI and the MSME, the
 type of collateral required and its corresponding loan-to-value (LTV) is derived.
 The MSME also submits the collateral documents (such as land or motor vehicle
 certificates, right to use documents) to the FI providing the credit.




67
6.1.2. Loan Approval

The commonly used credit evaluation framework for loan applications is “Six-C”
– evaluation of Character (entrepreneur profile), Capacity (financial statement
analysis), Capital (availability of equity), Credit (past credit history), Condition (loan
term) and Collateral (Table 19).

TABLE 19: SIX-C CREDIT EVALUATION FRAMEWORK




FIs in Indonesia follow different mechanisms to evaluate loan applications. Some
FIs use parameters such as house, income, asset and poverty indices to evaluate the
credit worthiness of the MSME (Table 20).




                                                                                             68
 TABLE 20: METRICS USED TO EVALUATE CREDIT WORTHINESS




 6.1.3. Loan Disbursement

 After the loan is approved, the FI registers the collateral security with the Fiducia
 Registration Office (FRO) and the Police Department (in case of vehicle-based
 collateral) before disbursement of loan.

 FIGURE 52: INTERACTION BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES FOR VEHICLE BASED
 FINANCING




 The MSME initially submits the ownership document to the FI along with the fees
 associated with the fiducia registration, and registers a block88 with the Police
 Department in case of motor vehicles based collateral.

 A deed is signed between the FI and the debtor with details regarding the loan
 terms. The signed deed (in Bahasa Indonesia) is notarized by the notary, who
 further registers the collateral with the FRO. It should be noted that Indonesian FIs
 currently do not have access to the fiducia system and depend on public notaries

 88 Block refers to the process where in the Police department does not allow creation of a duplicate certificate




69
registered with the FRO for this. The FI also issues a block89 against the collateral
with the Police Department, in the absence of which the debtor could reissue
duplicate ownership certificates through the Police Department. The cost for
issuing the block90 is approximately IDR 50,000 91.

6.1.4. Collateral Execution

FIs often collateralize the debts to cover their risks. In case of loan defaults, the FIs
recover their capital through sale of assets collateralized. The collateral execution
process is the most difficult for FIs, especially when lending on movable collateral.
An out-of- court settlement is the first choice for the financial institution. If the
settlement discussions do not materialize in a cordial manner, the FI initiates the
collateral execution procedures by informing the SID and the Fiducia’ Registration
Office of the loan default.

The financial institution executes the collateral through a private sale or a public
auction.

The state owned enterprises (banks and PT Pegadaian) are mandated to follow
the public auction route. The value realization through this route is lower than
market value as the public auctions are widely known to have distressed assets
under auction. Financial institutions believe that collateral listing on the state’s
auction list shows their seriousness in the collateral execution and encourages the
MSMEs to accept settlement offers. It should also be noted that Fiducia registration
entitles the banks to an executionary right on the collateral but not the right to
ownership and hence does not guarantee enforcement. Inadequate understanding
of the Fiducia law among law enforcement officials, results in long drawn court
cases. In the past, there have been specific cases where local authorities have
created obstacles during the collateral repossession process. Therefore, financial
institutions take on a police assistance during the collateral execution process.

     6.2.	     Challenges across Stages of Lending

     Across various stages of the entire lending process cycle, MSMEs and banks face
     multiple challenges that act as key impediments which need to be addressed to
     facilitate a greater lending ecosystem to MSMEs. This section will highlight various
     key challenges from the MSME perspective as well as the FI perspective that if
     addressed, can significantly increase the quantum of supply of financing.

     TABLE 22: LENDING CHALLENGES




     6.2.1. Loan Application

     6.2.1.1.	Financial Institution Challenges

     6.2.1.1.1. Non-Standardized Statements

     Bank Indonesia (BI) prescribes certain documentation norms that need to be
     adhered to in order to seek a loan. One of the documentation requirements is the
     submission of audited financial statements, which most of MSMEs do not have.
     Even un-audited financial statements are not in the format required by FIs. This
     results in either significant delays in getting loan approvals from FIs or even a
     complete rejection of a loan application. Banks perceive the availability of financial
     statements as one of the most important requirements for loan approval besides a
     fixed asset collateral document submission.

     To overcome this barrier, BI has formulated a study regarding minimum
     standards for financial statements and business plan for MSMEs. This study92 was
     conducted in line with the Financial Accounting Standards Entities without Public
     Accountability (SAK ETAP) which has been issued by the Financial Accounting
     Standards Board of Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI DSAK).

     6.2.1.1.2. Information Asymmetric

     Information asymmetric refers to inconsistency of data available at MSMEs and
     the data requirements of an FI to make informed decisions about providing credit.
     Several instances were observed during the study highlighting the magnitude of the
     92 Based on the primary interaction with Bank Indonesia during the study




71
information asymmetry that exists in the system. FIs are tackling this information
asymmetry as explained below.

     a) Should business owners be unable to produce collateral related documents,
     especially for hereditary land and building assets, FIs accept a letter from the
     village head.
     b) In the absence of business licenses, FIs physically inspect the business
     premises.
     c) Banks also take marriage certificates and education certificates as collateral
     in the case of female entrepreneurs since these assets have legally always been
     owned by male members of the family.

6.2.1.2.	MSME Challenges




Around 75 percent of MSMEs93 in Indonesia prefer to use microfinance institutions
(MFIs) and informal financing sources. Also more than 70 percent of MSMEs do not
approach banks after self-evaluation. The key reasons are:

     a) Thirty percent of the MSMEs feel that registration acts as a barrier; however
        in practice banks do not insist on this.
     b) Thirty-five percent of respondents feel that they do not have sufficient
        collateral.
     c) Twenty-five percent of respondents perceive the loans process to be time
        consuming and tedious.

Most of the MSME self-evaluated risks are perceived challenges since FIs have eased
the application process and relaxed the loan requirement. For example, a legal
registration status, while good to have, is not a mandatory requirement of FIs for
loan disbursement.

6.2.1.2.1. Legal Status

The World Bank Enterprise Survey conducted for Indonesia in 2009 highlights that
the average number of years for which the MSMEs are not formally registered is 2.4
years as compared with 0.9 years in Cambodia, 0.1 years in Philippines and 0.7 years
in Vietnam. None of the MSMEs interviewed during this study were registered with
the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (MoLHR) for legal entity registration, and
45 percent of respondents were registered with other government entities. These
registrations were with Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Trade – for trade licences
and with local governments and health departments – for restaurant licences.

For loan requirements in excess of IDR 50 million, a tax registration number
is mandatory. This can be obtained at no cost from the Directorate General of
Taxation. A domicile certificate is required for obtaining the registration number.
Though the domicile certificate can be obtained free of charge, MSMEs have to
effectively pay a significant amount to obtain it. In order to avoid the inconvenience
93 Based on primary interviews with 34 MSMEs based across Jakarta, East Java and Central Java.




                                                                                                 72
 and the expensive proposition of obtaining a tax registration number, many MSMEs
 refrain from approaching FIs such as commercial banks and rural banks for seeking
 credit.

 As mentioned above, MSMEs view this as a major impediment in their ability to
 obtain loans, but in the current scenario FIs do not insist on submission of these
 documents.

 6.2.1.2.2. Lack of Collateral

 Lack of collateral is both an actual and perceived challenge for the MSMEs. Banks do
 insist on collateral to safeguard their risks, but they are lenient on documentation.
 However, it is important to note that movable assets constitute more than 50
 percent of MSME assets. Since 2004, commercial banks have been allowed to accept
 assets other than land or buildings as deductions in determining loan loss reserves
 when allocating credit to MSMEs (details provided in Section 6.2.2.1.1.). This
 measure, however, failed to significantly enhance small firms’ access to credit as
 banks still insist on fixed assets collateral.

 The Kredit Usaha Rakyat (Community Business Credit; KUR) launched in 2007
 is a Government of Indonesia (GoI) initiative to overcome this barrier. It has the
 provision for Government-funded guarantee programs to provide comfort to banks
 for lending to feasible projects which are not bankable. But banks still insist on 100
 percent collateral for KUR-based loans. The KUR scheme has been explained in
 more detail in Section 4.3.1.3.3.

 6.2.1.2.3. Tedious Process

 Sixty percent of the respondents have stated that the tedious loan application
 process is a key deterrent for approaching commercial banks. The poor
 understanding of document requirements of FIs, especially those of commercial
 banks, make the process time consuming and complex. The MFIs, especially
 cooperatives and VCs, have tackled this challenge by conducting training sessions
 for its first-time customers. The training focuses on financial prudence in addition
 to creating awareness about products and associated loan terms.

 6.2.2. Loan Approval




 The loan approval process is primarily concerned with the verification of
 information submitted to an FI. The process also involves physical verification
 of the business, asset under collateral, etc. to ensure the genuineness of the loan
 requirement and also assess the ability or the willingness of the enterprise to repay
 the loan. Prudence in the loan approval process is the key for FIs in mitigating
 lending risks.




73
6.2.2.1.	Financial Institution Challenges

6.2.2.1.1. Provision for Asset Losses

FIs are mandated to maintain a loss reserve to protect bank assets against bad
loans. This reserve is a proportion of the FIs’ total lending portfolio. In the case
of collateralized loans, the proportion of market value of the underlying asset is
allowed to be deducted while calculating the provision for asset losses (Penyisihan
Penghapusan Aktiva - PPA).

External Barriers

The banking assets are classified as earning assets or non-earning assets for the
purpose of provisioning losses. Loans that are covered by collateral assets that fall
under earning assets are required to be provisioned as follows (Table 23):

**Excluding placement of rural banks on Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBI) and loans guaranteed by liquid collateral
of SBI, securities issued by the Government of Indonesia, savings and/or time deposits blocked by the rural bank in
question accompanied by power of attorney for disbursement and fiduciary money.


While traditionally the financial sector has seen lending only against fixed assets
such as land and building, there has been a deliberate effort by BI to create a
platform for FIs to look at movable assets as collateral for lending and at the
same time be covered against the loan loss reserve provisioning requirement. As
mentioned above, BI allows many movable assets as deductions in determining loan
loss reserves when allocating credit to MSMEs. BI has specific guidelines for the
proportion of collateral deductible from the PPA.

 * Depending on the vintage of appraisal of the collateral95

 As part of the above guidelines, accounts receivable which are the major constituent
 of MSME assets are not allowed to be deducted while calculating the provision for
 asset losses. In developed economies like the United States and Canada, more than
 40 percent of MSME lending use accounts receivable as collateral. In Indonesia,
 very few banks actually lend based on accounts receivable. Accounts receivable
 based financing is considered to be uncollateralized. Proper guidelines for accounts
 receivable based lending could potentially unlock huge supplies of capital for
 MSMEs. As mentioned in Section 4.3.1.2., accounts receivable based lending is used
 exclusively by FIs for institutional lending. No provision for accounts receivable puts
 these institutions at a disadvantage.

 Further, to increase lending to the fisheries sector, BI is contemplating a guideline
 for small boat based lending.

 Internal Barriers

 Perceived risks on movable collateral: Banks in Indonesia have historically only
 lent on fixed collateral. Since 2004, banks have allowed collateralization of movable
 assets. But the loan officials who perceive movable assets as risky are still sceptical
 95 Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 14/15/ PBI / 2012 concerning assessment of commercial bank asset
 quality




75
to lend on movable assets. This trend has been observed particularly in state-
owned banks (SOBs) where higher non-performing loan (NPL) rates are equated to
corruption. In addition, implementation of guidelines has been ineffective: BI issued
PBI no. 13/26/PBI/2011 to encourage lending on movable assets with prudence,
but the awareness and adoption of this is still poor among rural banks. Currently,
lending is limited to a few categories of assets including land, building, cash and
vehicles.

6.2.2.1.2. Shortcomings in Credit Bureaus

The Debtor Information System (SID) is a credit bureau owned and managed by
BI, which maintains the credit history of both individuals and business. Currently
120 commercial banks, 1,304 Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (BPRs) and 20 non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs) are members of SID. The Financial Services Authority
(OJK) is contemplating mandating NBFIs to be a part of SID to make it a more
robust and comprehensive database for providing credit history of debtors.

One objective of SID is for MSMEs to get access to financing based on their credit
records rather than just depend on the availability of collateral. Most of MSMEs
avail loans from MFIs who are not members of SID. When MSMEs graduate to
the next level (i.e. micro to small) and approach commercial banks to meet their
higher demand, banks do not have access to the past credit information of these
enterprises. MSMEs then have to re-establish their credentials, thereby defeating
one of the key objectives of SID. SID currently captures only the name of the
creditor, debtor and the repayment status. Banks have to access other databases like
Fiducia to avail complete credit history of the debtor. The data gaps in SID are one of
the key challenges for banks while determining the debtor’s credit history.

Through regulation 15/1/PBI/2013, BI has opened the credit information sharing
practice to private entities (Lembaga Pengelola Informasi Perkreditan – LPIP). The
private credit bureaus are expected to capture other information including utility
payments, and can be operational by 2016. The new bureaus could also capture
information from other FIs including MFIs, NBFIs, etc. As one of the ”grass roots” of
credit information sharing practice, SISKOPDIT is developed by one of the largest
MFI associations, INKOPDIT, to capture information of its 930+ credit unions.

While it may seem logical to integrate the information stored on SISKOPDIT with
the information on SID, MFI associations such as INKOPDIT have shown resistance
towards this thought as it may reduce their competitive advantage, and may
potentially cause loss of their good customers to commercial banks providing credit
at lower interest rates.

6.2.2.1.3. Shortcomings in Fiducia

The Fiduciary Transfer Law was adopted in 199996 to regulate fiduciary securities.
Fiduciary security is a right, securing the repayment of debt over tangible and
intangible movable assets and fixed assets. Unless mentioned otherwise in the
agreement between creditor and debtor, the security also covers products resulting
from, or insurance claims from, the assets collateralized. The collateralized assets
96 Law no. 42 of 1999




                                                                                          76
     are in the possession of the debtor. The FRO was set up as a part of the Ministry of
     Law and Human Rights (MoLHR) under this law.97

     The key benefits that the FRO provides are:

          a) Asset execution rights to creditors on payment defaults.
          b) Provision for both current and future debts to be secured by fiduciary transfer,
          c) Creation of transparency by making fiduciary security registry open to public,
          d) Enabling of secondary financing by allowing financing on secured sales contract,
          e) Following the collateral into the hands of transferees,
          f) Definition of scope of collateral to include the profits and proceeds of the
             original collateral
          g) Definition of priority of the creditor.

     The system was originally manual but moved online in February 2013. Till
     November 12, 201398, for example, more than three million fiducia securities
     are registered in DKI Jakarta regional office. The manual data has still not been
     digitized. The system currently does not capture specifics of collateral. Only 20
     percent99 of the collateralized loans are registered with the fiducia system. Many
     developing countries such as China, Ghana, Vietnam and Cambodia among others
     have addressed this situation where the assets collateralized are registered with the
     collateral registry. The registry maintains critical information on the assets, including
     movable assets, and ensures that each asset registered has a unique identification
     attached to the collateral. The details on the asset coverage for collateral registry and
     other details regarding Fiducia are covered in Section 8.3.4.

     Data gaps in the Fiducia database and manual nature of old data render the cross-
     checking process tedious, time-consuming and practically unfeasible.

     6.2.2.1.4. Valuation of Assets

     Valuation of collateral is a critical component of the loan approval process. This
     helps FIs cover their risks efficiently. On valuation of fixed assets, banks usually
     use internal surveyors. Banks use the property tax certificates and knowledge of
     the prevalent property rates to value these assets. As per BI, for a loan above IDR 5
     billion an external surveyor is required, the additional cost of which is restricted to a
     maximum of 10 percent of asset value.

     As far as movable assets are concerned, with respect to their valuation for deriving
     their LTV, most banks are sceptical about the quality of movable assets other than
     vehicles (banks use local newspapers like Poskota for valuation of vehicles) and do
     not have robust valuation mechanisms for dynamic movable assets such as accounts
     receivable, livestock, inventory, etc. The proportion of the collateral which can be
     subtracted as deductible from reserve also depends on the vintage of the survey (see
     Table 25 for land and buildings, as specified by BI).


     97 In 2000, via Presidential Decree Number 139/2000
     98 Based on primary interaction with Fiducia Registration Office on November 12, 2013
     99 According to Secretary General of the General Administrative Law and Human Rights Ministry, revenue lost by
     FRO is IDR 300 billion against IDR 90 billion revenues, making total registration rate of around 23%.

For example, if the market value of land was found to be IDR 5 billion when
surveyed 15 months ago, then IDR 3.5 billion could be subtracted from the loan
reserve if the survey was conducted by an external surveyor, or IDR 2.5 billion could
be subtracted if the bank conducted an internal survey. Thus, the assets collateral
needs to be valued on a continuous basis to draw benefits.

High cost of valuation and limited availability of surveyors is an important barrier
in the loan approval process.

6.2.2.2.	MSME Challenges

The challenges faced by FIs make the loan approval process lengthy. The loan
approval process can take up to four to six100 months for a commercial bank.
Generally, cooperatives lending on the group lending model, and CUs, train MSMEs
for a period of three to six months before approving the first loan. For the second
loan onwards the loan disbursement process takes less than a week. MSMEs
require funds immediately to run their operation. This delay impacts their business
negatively making it an important challenge for MSMEs.

6.2.3.	 Loan Disbursement

6.2.3.1. Financial Institution Challenges




6.2.3.1.1. Fiducia Time Taken

Registration with FRO is a two-step process. The steps are:

Step I: Notarizing the loan deed

A loan agreement is first signed between the creditor and debtor in Bahasa
Indonesia which is then notarized by the public notary. Any notary registered with
the MoLHR can notarize the loan agreement.

While notarizing the deed is a one-day process, the availability of an authorized
public notary has been identified by many FIs as a big concern and has often
resulted in delayed collateral registration due to non-availability of the public
notaries.

100 Based on primary interaction with 34 MSMEs, 14 large commercial banks in Indonesia and 53 MFI/
MFI holding companies which have been interviewed across Jakarta, East Java and Central Java. Details of the
financial institutions have been provided in appendix.




                                                                                                               78
 Step II: Registration of the notarized assignment with the FRO

 Earlier, registrations were done by the provincial FRO resulting in additional travel
 costs and time. In the online system which became effective in February 2013,
 a registered public notary files the collateral registration online. The number of
 notaries registered with the system to facilitate the process is limited as indicated
 above. Even in the Jakarta National Capital Region, only around 150 notaries are
 registered with the online system. FIs have indicated that notaries are not available
 on some smaller islands, and representatives have to travel to another island for
 registering with the FRO. After the notary files the registration, it usually takes
 around a month for the Fiducia certificate to be issued. It is therefore imperative to
 address the situation of who additionally can be authorized to register the collateral
 with the FRO, or alternatively to address the limited availability of the public
 notaries for the Fiducia registration.

 To overcome this challenge, the state-owned Pawnshop PT Pegadaian has Fiducia-
 based lending in their urban centers only where they have connections with
 notaries. Several NBFIs have also indicated that they only register with the FRO
 when the loan quality deteriorates.

 6.2.3.1.2. Dynamic Collateral Management

 FIs have indicated that unavailability of human capital to manage the dynamic
 collateral acts as an impediment to lend based on dynamic collateral like inventory.
 A few larger banks like Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) hire external collateral
 managers for managing inventory.

 There is currently no separate cost structure for registering dynamic collateral.
 Banks like Bank Andara which predominantly lend on accounts receivable have
 indicated that they would like to update the changed value of collateral with the
 FRO but currently the cost and time taken is the same as a new registration.
 Inadequate human capital and high cost of updating collateral values with the FRO
 is a challenge for lending against dynamic collateral.

 6.2.3.1.3. Multiple Registrations

 Vehicles are the dominant collateral for movable assets based lending in Indonesia.
 For credit provided based on vehicles as collateral, FIs have to register with both the
 FRO and the Police Department to cover their risks. This step adds to the cost (IDR
 50,000) and time taken.

 6.2.3.2.	MSME Challenges

 6.2.3.2.1. Fiducia Cost

 Although the FI is responsible for registering with the FRO, the cost is borne by
 MSMEs.

        IDR 500 billion– IDR 1 trillion                           3,200,000

           More than IDR 1 trillion                               6,400,000


Primary interactions with FIs under this study revealed that the actual cost for
registration including notary charges and other unofficial costs is much higher.
The actual costs provided by FIs (including fiducia registration cost and the notary
fees)102 are:
      a) IDR 1 million for a IDR 1 billion loan
      b) IDR 700,000 for a IDR 500 million loan
      c) IDR 175,000 for a IDR 50 million loan

Global benchmarks suggest that the cost of Fiducia registration range around USD 5
for every asset registration. When compared to the global benchmarks, the current
cost structure of Fiducia registration in Indonesia is fairly high and could potentially
be lowered in times to come.

6.2.4. Collateral Execution

6.2.4.1.	 Financial Institution Challenges

6.2.4.1.1. Priority of Collateral

In Indonesia, an asset can be collateralized only once until the debt against the
asset is paid off. In case of double collateralization, the Fiducia law103 prioritizes the
creditors based on the date of registration, leaving the second lender unprotected.
Currently, the Fiducia registry does not capture the unique identification number of
collateral, making it difficult to cross-check against the re-registration of the same
asset with a different lender. In the past there have been cases where a motorcycle
was pledged as collateral with a cooperative and then pawned with PT Pegadaian.
In such cases, FIs have to undergo a lengthy and costly legal case to claim execution
rights on the collateral.

and 14 large commercial banks in Indonesia. Details of the interviewees have been mentioned in the appendix.

                                                                                                                80
     6.2.4.1.2. Asset Degradation and Loss

     Assets pledged under the Fiducia law remain in possession of the debtor. Improper
     use of pledged assets leads to asset degradation and devaluations. Considering
     that movable collateral can be stolen and also hidden at the time of enforcement
     further complicates the possibility of exercising movable collateral for lending.
     Unavailability of unique identification numbers for collateral makes it easier for
     debtors to replace it. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there have been cases in
     which parts of high-end motorcycles were replaced with cheaper parts.

     6.2.4.1.3. Lengthy and Costly Process

     The Fiducia law gives the creditor executionary right and not the right to ownership
     over the pledged asset in case of default. FIs have stated that this has caused specific
     problems especially when Police Departments become involved. While the fiducia
     law provides the executionary right of the asset, the information on the asset
     registry is not passed on to the Police Department. Considering that the asset is still
     legally owned by the debtor, the police officers generally ask for a court document
     to allow repossession. This leads to a lengthy and costly legal process.

     Enforcement Cost

     As per the World Bank Doing Business Report (2014), the cost of enforcing
     contracts in Indonesia is 139 percent of the value of contract and among one of the
     highest in the world. It should be noted that the cost of police involvement is not
     included in this estimate. Comparison with other geographies has been captured in
     Section 8.1.

     FIGURE 53: ENFORCEMENT COSTS




     6.2.5. Challenges Related to Technical Capacity of Financial Institutions

     Many FIs are facing significant capacity-related challenges especially while lending
     to MSMEs. Though these challenges are FI specific, the inefficiencies created
     significantly impact the MSME lending sector.

     6.2.5.1.	 Attrition

     Attrition is identified as a significant challenge especially for FIs in microbanking.
     Movement of professionals is seen across cooperatives, Unit Desa, BPRs and
     microbanking units of major banks. Relationships and comfort level between loan
     officers and debtors is key in this sector. Relationships also play an important role
     when the debtor graduates from micro to the small/commercial category.


81
6.2.5.2.	Technical Capability of Human Capital

Understanding and awareness of the risks associated and valuation mechanism of
various types of movable collateral is considered to be one of the key challenges for
movable assets based lending. Many FIs have also pointed out that skill and lack
of technical know-how of human resources required for management of movable
collateral of a dynamic nature (such as inventory and accounts receivable), and
perceived complexity of the warehouse receipt business model, are the key reasons
for minimal lending on such movable assets.

6.3. Summarizing Key Challenges

The challenges in the lending process highlighted above can be broadly classified as
1) technical capacity and awareness related challenges, 2) infrastructural challenges
and 3) challenges resulting from inadequate regulations and legal provisions. These
challenges are further explained below.

 Technical Capacity and Awareness Related Challenges
 MSME awareness regarding loan process and documentation
 FI capacity related to valuating collateral, managing movable collateral and
 determination of risks in movable assets based lending
 Inadequate knowledge among Police about Fiducia laws
 Infrastructural Challenges
 Data gaps in the credit bureau (SID)
 Data gaps in the Fiducia registry, unavailability of cross checking facility
 and high cost of registration
 Limited number of notaries, surveyors and warehouse managers
 No information integration to track credit history, assets collateralized and
 interaction with the law enforcement (police) information
 Inadequate warehouse infrastructure
 Challenges Resulting From Inadequate Regulations and Legal Provisions
 No protection for creditor with second lien
 No guidelines for lending on accounts receivable
 Lax enforcement laws in case of defaults

                                                                                        82
     7. Key Recommendations
     As identified in the challenges section, improvements and initiatives are required:
     a) to enhance technical capacities of all stakeholders; b) for integration and
     upgrading of supporting infrastructure (databases and registries); and c) in current
     laws and regulations.

     Key recommendations for improving movable assets based lending to MSMEs are:

     Awareness Creation and Capacity Building
     Raising MSME awareness about loan requirements and building technical
     capacity in loan documentation (financial statement)
     Building FI capacity in asset valuation and risk associated with collateral
     Raising Notaries and Police awareness about Fiducia laws
     Centralized and Accessible Infrastructure
     Greater credit bureau penetration among FIs
     Cheaper and more accessible Fiducia with specifics on collateral and search
     capability
     Cross-linking information between credit bureaus, Fiducia and police databases
     Stronger Laws and Comprehensive Regulation
     Creditor priority and stronger enforcement rights post default
     Regulation and guidelines to lend on movable collateral, for example accounts
     receivable

     7.1. Awareness Creation and Capacity Building

     7.1.1. Capacity of MSMEs

     7.1.1.1.	Awareness and Capacity Building Related to Loan Documentation

     It has been observed that most of the challenges faced by MSMEs are perceived in
     nature; hence it is important to create awareness about lending practices including
     collateral and documentation for MSMEs. BI has taken many steps to increase
     awareness. These include:

        a) Issuance of PBI no. 14/22/PBI/2012 which addresses technical capacity
           building of MSMEs,
        b) Development of templates for financial statements of MSMEs and pilot
           project for their adoption, and
        c) Development of MSME rating tool.

     While BI consistently endeavors to increase technical capacity of MSMEs, additional
     steps need to be taken to increase awareness and penetration of these programs.



83
7.1.1.2.	Improving Enterprise Registrations

MSMEs also face significant challenges in the registration process. These include:

    a) Perception by MSMEs that registration with the MoLHR or the Directorate
       General of Taxation would increase their tax liability, and
    b) Lack of possession of trade licenses by many MSMEs, and the fact that many
       are not registered with local governments.

The MoLHR, the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises
(MCSME) and other relevant central and local governments need to assist MSMEs in
getting registered. This can be achieved by registration camps or by setting up one-
window services as proposed by the MCSME.

7.1.2.	 Capacity of Financial Institutions

Human capital is a key concern for FIs especially in the microbanking space. There
is a need to increase the supply of microbanking professionals to keep pace with the
increasing demand. Many specific training and awareness programs are required as
mentioned below:

   a) Training in understanding of MSME business,
   b) Capacity building for movable assets based lending especially to loan officers,
      enabling them to make informed decisions,
   c) Awareness about technical guidelines on movable assets based lending,
   d) Valuation of movable assets, and
   e) Movable collateral management especially for dynamic collateral like
      inventory.

BI has initiated specific programs for increasing capacity of FIs, especially focused
on MSME lending. Other regulators including OJK and the MCSME need to
undertake similar initiatives.

7.1.3.	 Capacity of Other Stakeholders

The lending process involves many stakeholders such as police officials, notaries
and lawyers. Specific training needs have been identified for these stakeholders.

    •	 Police officials: The Police Department is involved in the collateral execution
       process. Limited awareness about the Fiducia law among police officials has
       been identified as a key challenge.
    •	 Notaries: The notary is the critical link between FIs and the Fiducia registry.
       The limited number of notaries registered with the online fiducia system
       is a bottleneck in the registration process. Efforts need to be undertaken to
       increase the number of notaries registered with the Fiducia system.
    •	 Warehouses and surveyors: Lack of warehouse infrastructure is limiting
       the penetration of warehouse receipts-based financing. In addition there is
       a need to increase the supply of surveyors and valuators to increase both
       conventional and warehouse based lending.




                                                                                         84
 As the capacity building requirements for police officials and notaries are
 related to the Fiducia law, the MoLHR would be the key in implementing this
 recommendation.

 7.2. Centralized and Accessible Infrastructure

 7.2.1. Credit Bureau

 The current operational credit bureau, SID, is managed by BI. Currently only 120
 commercial banks, 1304 rural banks and 20 NBFIs are members of SID. Although
 the members of the credit bureau supply 70 percent104 of the formal supply to
 MSMEs, data for most of the microenterprises availing loans from cooperatives and
 other MFIs is not captured. Thus there is a need to develop a comprehensive credit
 bureau with complete credit history of MSMEs. This would improve financial access
 of MSMEs.

 It should be understood that the credit bureau is a closed system with proprietary
 data. Through regulation 15/1/PBI/2013, BI has opened the credit information
 sharing practice to private entities (LPIP). These new LPIPs should target larger
 penetration across the financial landscape along with capturing other relevant
 credit data like utility payments.

 7.2.2. Fiducia System

      a) Accessibility: The Fiducia system moved online in February 2013, but is
         accessible only to notaries. The unavailability of notaries is a key concern.
         Therefore, like SID, the Fiducia registry should be directly accessible to FIs.
      b) Cost rationalization: The cost of registration (including notarizing cost) is
         high in Indonesia. Internationally the cost of registration is below USD 5105.
         Cost of updating dynamic collateral and issuance of duplicate certificates
         needs to be rationalized.
      c) Specifics on collateral: The collateral registry could include additional fields
         to enter specifics of the collateral (such as the chassis number of vehicles).
      d) Digitization of old data: As the registry only moved online in February
         2013, the old manual data needs to be digitized to facilitate the search facility.
      e) Increase of penetration: As per Indonesian Central Auditor reports, the
         registry is losing revenue of IDR 300 billion as against an income of IDR 70
         million. This depicts that the registration on the registry is not exhaustive;
         efforts need to be taken to increase adoption of the registry among FIs.
      f) Cross-checking facility: Data gaps, manual data and inadequate parameters
         make it difficult to cross-check the asset collateralization status. This allows
         duplicate registration on the same assets.

 As the Fiducia system is currently managed by the MoLHR, it should play an
 important role in implementing the recommendations.

 104 Based on supply side estimation, of credit to MSMEs, from different sources such as banks, MFI, other
 financial institutions etc. Further accounting for rural banks in the SID system and few NBFIS, 70% has been
 estimated.

 shortlisted for Global Best Practices, Vietnam, China and Ghana, are further referred to in the section 8 below..




85
7.2.3. Linkages between the Credit Bureau, the Fiducia Registry and the Police
Database

Currently, FIs need to interact with all three agencies to sufficiently manage their
risks. An inter-linked database would help FIs as it would reduce time and cost.

FIGURE 54: PROPOSED INTEGRATED SYSTEM




Under the proposed system, during the loan approval system an FI obtains all
the relevant data from the credit bureau. However, during the loan disbursement
process, the FI needs to interact with both the credit bureau and the FRO. The FRO
would inform the Police Department after the Fiduciary security is registered.

7.3.	   Laws and Regulations

7.3.1.	 Stronger Creditors’ Rights

Indonesian laws have certain provisions defining creditor priority. The current
laws give creditors merely executionary right in case of default as against right
to ownership, even in cases where the debtor agrees to transferring the security.
Limited knowledge of the Fiducia law among police personnel makes it necessary to
take a legal recourse. Quick and simple enforcement would help improve creditors’
rights and further improve movable assets based lending. Though the law currently
provides for a publicly accessible security registry, the creditors lack access to this
critical information. The provision of a system to easily access the information of
existing securities would significantly help in assuring the rights of the creditors.

The SOBs in Indonesia are required to enforce securities through the public
auction route, whereby the value realization is lower than market rate. Designing
laws similar to the Indian Securitization Act of 2003 which allow SOBs to enforce
security out of court would help improve movable assets based lending from
state-owned FIs in Indonesia. In India, the time for execution of collateral has
dropped from 10 years to nine months. It should be noted however that though
this act has significantly reduced the time for execution, IFC is working with Indian
agencies such as Central Registry of Securitization Asset Reconstruction and
Security Interest of India (CERSAI) to improve other aspects of regulation related to
movable assets based lending,


                                                                                          86
     Currently various types of interest over assets including the Fiducia registry,
     financial leases, long-term operating leases, secured sales etc., are governed by
     different laws in Indonesia. A single comprehensive legal framework should be
     implemented in which all these non-possessionary interests could be considered as
     equal in defining the priority and rights of the creditors.

     7.3.2. Improved Regulations

     Currently, accounts receivable are not allowed to be deducted while calculating the
     provision for asset losses. Guidelines to lend against accounts receivable would
     improve financial access to MSMEs, as they constitute a significant proportion of the
     MSMEs asset base.

7.5.1. Analysis of Ease of Implementation vs. Time for Implementing

FIGURE 55: EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION VERSUS TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING




							
The categorization of the recommendations has been done based on involvement
of multiple stakeholders in and the estimated duration for the implementation.
Capacity building of FIs and other stakeholders constitutes a “low-hanging fruit”.
Owing to the large number of MSMEs, the overall time taken for implementation
of MSMEs’ technical capacity building and awareness raising is fairly long. The
success of interlinking the SID, the Fiducia and the police database depends on the
improvements made in the Fiducia and the credit bureau system, making it a costly
and time-consuming affair.

     In developed counties, accounts receivable based lending forms a significant
     proportion of movable MSME lending. In Indonesia, the accounts receivable form a
     significant proportion of the MSMEs’ assets. Thus improved regulation for accounts
     receivable is a high-impact activity. The other high-impact recommendations are
     improving infrastructure for warehouse receipts and improvements in the Fiducia
     system. Though time consuming and difficult to implement, these are needed for
     long-term sustainable development of the MSME financing sector.

8. International Best Practices
According to the Enterprise Survey, around 32.5 percent of SMEs internationally
identify access to financing as a major constraint to their businesses. One of the key
reasons for poor access to financing has been identified as lack of acceptable collateral.
In the developing world, 78 percent of the capital stock of businesses is typically in
movable assets such as machinery, equipment or receivables, and only 22 percent in
immovable property. In economies with a modern secured transactions system, these
assets could easily be used as collateral. But in many developing economies movable
property might be unacceptable to lenders as collateral – either because the law does
not recognize non-possessory interests in movable collateral or because it does not
provide sufficient protection for lenders accepting it.

IFC has developed the Secured Lending Program to promote and facilitate the
development of efficient secured transactions systems and collateral registries,
resulting in expansion of access to finance especially for SMEs.

8.1. Indonesia in Comparison with Other Developing Economies

When compared with other developing economies such as Ghana, Vietnam and China,
Indonesia performs poorly on broad parameters such as firm registration, getting
credit and contract enforcement.

     Firm Registrations – Globally, Indonesia ranks at 175 out of 189 economies on ease
     of starting a business. The average number of days required to start a business is
     high when compared to other developing economies such as Ghana, Vietnam and
     China. Though Indonesia made efforts in 2012 to improve the application process
     by allowing applicants to simultaneously obtain both a general trading license and a
     business registration certificate, this has not significantly improved its performance
     vis-à-vis other economies.

     A major cost involved for an enterprise to register its business in Indonesia is
     for notarizing company documents (IDR 4,464,464/USD 450) and fees for legal
     services (IDR 200,000/USD 20 for name check + IDR 1,580,000/USD 158 non-
     tax state revenue, PNBP fees for legal service). These costs are exempted for a
     micro and small sized company in China; are around USD 5 in Ghana for name
     search and approximately USD 100 for other fees; and under USD 125 in Vietnam
     (which includes USD 10 for name search as well as business registration and tax
     registration certificate).

     Getting Credit – The depth of credit information index measures the coverage,
     scope and accessibility of credit information available through a public credit
     registry or a private credit bureau. It also includes strength of legal rights of lender
     through collateral laws.

     As compared to China, Ghana and Vietnam, the credit information bureau in
     Indonesia does not distribute more than two years of historical credit information.
     This does not allow the lender to assess the repayment capacity of the borrowers,
     and acts against making prudent lending decisions. Furthermore, when compared
     to Ghana and Vietnam, Indonesia needs to improve its legal rights for lenders in
     regards to collateral registry.

     Strength of Legal Rights – As a part of credit index, strength of legal rights assess
     rights of borrowers and lenders through collateral laws and protection of secured
     creditors’ rights through bankruptcy laws.

     Indonesia does not have a functional online registry for assets that is unified
     geographically and by asset type, with an electronic database indexed by debtor’s
     names. This when compared to Ghana and Vietnam acts as a deterrent for the
     lender to ascertain imposition of guarantee on the collateral, and prevents clear
     establishment of its rights in case of default. In addition, secured creditors are not
     paid first in the event of insolvency of the debtor or when the debtor defaults.
     As compared to other developing economies, laws in Indonesia do not allow
     the creditors to enter into an agreement at the time of lending that out of court
     settlement of the collateral may be initiated by the creditor in case the borrower
     defaults. This increases the enforcement time and cost for the creditor.

     Enforcing Contracts – Concerning the time taken and cost incurred to enforce
     a contract in Indonesia, filing a court case in Indonesia takes approximately 100
     days, as compared to other economies like Ghana and China in which it takes less
     than 20 days.




91
The overall cost of a claim, which is as high as 140 percent of claim value, makes
judicial proceedings for enforcement economically nonviable. The cost of attorney
is maximum in Indonesia (111 percent of claim), when compared to China (7.6
percent of claim), Ghana (10 percent of claim), and Vietnam (21 percent of claim).

8.2. Current State of Secured Transactions in Indonesia

FIs in Indonesia lending to MSMEs prefer immovable collateral such as land and
building, and lend only on vehicles as movable collateral. There are some MFIs
which lend on other movable collateral such as accounts receivable, consumer
durables, etc. but their share in the total MSME lending is very insignificant.

Lack of clarity on regulations for movable assets based lending, high cost and
other constraints of collateral registry and inadequate enforcement laws are major
challenges for growth of this business. These challenges have been successfully
addressed in other developing economies through secured transaction reforms,
which improved access to finance for MSMEs. Case studies on countries such as
Vietnam, Ghana and China are discussed below.

8.3. International Best Practices for Secured Transactions

Globally, implementation of the collateral registry for movable assets has increased
firms’ access to finance by around 8 percent, with the largest impact on smaller
firms. Access to women entrepreneurs has improved, with women-owned
businesses accessing credit based on non-land collateral.107

8.3.1. Vietnam

In Vietnam, regulations to use movable assets as collateral have been in place since
1999, as Decree 165 of the Civil Code of Vietnam, but subsequent amendments to
the act have led to restrictive practices to lend against movable collateral.
State-owned commercial banks and private banks provided commercial loans
secured by movable collateral only as a supplementary collateral. Lending was
biased towards real estate which was used as the most preferred collateral by
banks, followed by machinery and equipment. Lenders faced enforcement issues on
movable assets.

The Civil Code of 2005 introduced reforms for secured transactions. This Code
contains provisions on movable property as security that are broadly in line with
those in the original Decree 165. The new regulations allowed all types of movable
property to be used as collateral, including property that arises in the future. It also
confirmed payment priority of the creditors and reduced registration time of the
movable assets. The online registry was launched in March 2012, and is managed
by the Ministry of Justice.

 8.3.2. Ghana

 Before 2008, 85 percent108 of the lending activities in Ghana were mainly
 concentrated around state-owned enterprises and large corporate clients (both
 local and foreign), due to their low risk profile.

 FIs had limited portfolios towards MSME lending due to lack of collateral or the risk
 that the same collateral would be used for multiple loans. SMEs were given loans
 only in cases involving immovable assets such as land to offer as collateral. Lending
 to new clients who did not have past credit records was riskier since there was no
 credit information bureau to share past credit history of the borrowers.
 Identifying the need of a strong law defining borrowers and creditors’ rights,
 the Ghanaian Government passed the Borrowers and Lenders Act in 2008 and
 subsequently (2010) a collateral registry was established in the Bank of Ghana.
 By June 2013 more than 53,000 security interests had been registered by FIs. These
 account for more than USD 10 billion in loans secured with movable property –
 loans that have benefited more than 7,000 SMEs and 30,000 microenterprises.
 More than 10,000 women entrepreneurs received formal finances109.

 FIGURE 57: TYPE OF COLLATERAL REGISTERED




 The collateral registry and law has also increased the confidence of banks and
 NBFIs taking movable property as collateral: out of 52 FIs, 39 institutions (17
 banks, 16 NBFIs, four foreign-based banks and two rural banks) have registered
 with the collateral registry and granted loans secured with movable property.

 8.3.3. China

 China has a large number of SMEs whose assets are mostly in the form of
 equipment, inventory and receivables. Lack of credit has been cited as one of the
 most significant constraints for businesses in China 110.

 Secured transactions laws in China restricted the use of movable collateral. Due to
 this unfavorable legal framework and lack of knowledge, lenders did not want to
 take movable assets as collateral. This resulted in Chinese businesses holding more
 than USD 2 trillion as “dead capital” (their movable assets).

China enacted the new Property Law in China in 2007, adopting a number of
important principles of a modern secured transactions system and opening up
the scope for movables lending (including receivables). The law also sets up a
clearer priority rule and provides a better basis for enforcement. Further, registries
for accounts receivable and leasing were created in October 2007 and 2009
respectively. These were managed by the Credit Reference Center, People’s Bank
of China. The online registry, accessible to the public, helped in disseminating
creditors’ information and defining creditors’ priority over movable collateral.
As of June 30, 2011, more than 385,000 transactions have been registered,
facilitating USD 3.58 trillion accounts receivable financing including USD 1.09
trillion of SME lending in China. In addition, the total number of commercial loans
involving movable finance grew by 21 percent per year over 2008–10. These
interventions also had a significant effect on leasing and factoring markets. The
lease registry has recorded 35,426 leasing transactions cumulatively. The value
of factoring grew from 2.6 billion Euros in 2003 to 67.3 billion Euros in 2009,
according to data from Factors Chain International. Four of the five big banks have
reported an average 25 percent CAGR of their movables lending over 2008–2010 (2
percent over 2006–08).

Similar interventions in Liberia, Malawi, Honduras, and Mexico have improved the
access to financing in these countries.

8.3.4.	 Coverage of Movable Assets in Other Economies

As a part of secured transaction reforms, different movable assets have been
allowed by country-specific regulations to be registered for collateralize lending.
Except in the case of China, where accounts receivable are the only movable assets
to be registered, almost all other types of movable assets have been allowed to be
registered to ease lending to MSMEs.

 8.4. Key Learnings From Global Secured Transaction Reforms

 Implementation of secured transaction globally has improved the status quo of
 financing for MSMEs. Major highlights of secured transaction programs can be
 summed up as indicated below,

         Credit Information

            •	 Secured transaction reforms improving the disclosure standards of
               borrowers and lenders
            •	 Licensing private credit bureaus with access to government databases
            •	 Basic data on credit, details of lenders and borrowers and linking to the
               data on collateral used, which in turns is collected in a notice-based filing
               system
            •	 Allowing borrowers to examine their own credit history
     	
         Collateral Registry

            •	 Modern centralised registry, managed by financial institutions or a
               government body having strong influence on the financial system of the
               country
            •	 Low/flat fees for registration, amendments, searches and certificates
               (average below USD 5)

         Enforcement

            •	 Incorporating specific rules about priority of creditors by date of
               registration, rules on proceeds, buyers of collateral, special priority, etc.
            •	 Allowing lenders to initiate out-of-court settlement in case of defaults, and
               allowing private sale of collateral at market prices
