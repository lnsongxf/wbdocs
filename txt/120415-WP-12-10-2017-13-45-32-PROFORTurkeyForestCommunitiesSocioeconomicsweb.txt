NWFPs have traditionally been collected by forest villagers at
low prices (tariff price) and there is a need to strengthen the
value-chain of NWFPs by encouraging more local processing
and value adding. Targeted programs that enable investments
in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for processing and
packaging of NWFPs would strengthen the value chain and
local connections (e.g. via e-commerce). While the potential
of NWFPs should not be oversold in terms of their potential
for lifting thousands of people out of poverty, they can make
a difference to those located near high-value products that
can be developed. So where are the opportunities for NWFP
strengthening and development?

Recommendation 3: A comprehensive and expansive National
Forestry Inventory (NFI) is an essential tool for future policy
and NWFP sector development. The current system of assessing
forest data on a national level relies on the amalgamation of
information from forest management plans to provide data on
forest resources at a national level for policy, planning and for
data to comply with its international reporting commitments.
This has a number of shortcomings including the timeliness of
data and lack of precision in the main parameters. National
forest policy also requires accurate, timely and comprehensive
information. An NFI could help identify region-specific issues,
such as tourism opportunities, road infrastructure, NWFP
location and potential and help the GDF prioritize these issues.
Information generated would also be useful to forest villagers
for local development and support programs. Work in this area
would also include expanding the NFI to cover other important
issues such as biomass and soil carbon. This wider accounting
stance would allow for estimation of the Total Economic Value
(TEV) of forest and ecosystem services, which are not currently
valued, which leads to more informed decision making on the
development potential of specific forest areas.

The NFI could be combined with future socioeconomic surveys
of forest villagers to help identify potential new opportunities of
support through ORKOY.

   or more are classed as “productive” forest and required to have an allowable cut identified in the forest management plan. The area of forests owned by private persons
   and public entities with status as a legal entity is approximately 22,000 ha. However due to the definition of forest and the fact that some private land planted with trees
   remains classed as agricultural land, the area of private forest is significantly understated, and includes an estimated 160,000 - 200,000 ha of high yielding plantations

       total budget was 150 million TL ($US50 million) – with 120 million allocated to loans/credits and 30 million to
       grants. Individuals can apply for credits and grants for social and economic purposes. Loans and grants are also
       offered to established cooperatives within villages.

       Individual Credit/Grant program

       Social Purpose Credit Support: These credits target improvements for forest villagers’ quality of life and forest
       conservation efforts, specifically to reduce the use wood as fuel for heating and preventing the misuse of wood.
       Some examples include roof covering materials, central heating systems for households and energy efficient stoves
       with ovens, solar water heating systems, and exterior thermal insulation projects. Social purpose credits may be
       repaid over a period between 3-7 years, and are interest-free on the first 20%. Between the period 2004-2015,
       139,295 solar water heating systems were installed, benefitting over 557,000 forest villagers. In 2016, ORKOY
       also began supporting electricity production from photovoltaics (PV).

       Economic Purpose Credit Support: These credits aim to create income-generating opportunities for forest villagers.
       For example: animal husbandry, beekeeping, mushroom cultivation, medicinal and aromatic plant production,
       greenhouses, viniculture, fisheries and micro credit programs for housewives.

       The terms for economic credits are:

       •	 For revenue-generating projects, the annual interest rate is 1/7th the T.C. Ziraat Bank’s agricultural loan annual
          interest rate; currently 1.5% over the maturity date, and loan repayments vary from 4-7 years, depending on the
          activity. Livestock support is currently interest-free.
       •	 There is also grant support for these projects at a rate of 20% of the project amount.

       *Appendix 1 provides examples and further details on requirements and eligibility.

       Cooperative Loan/Grant Program

       Cooperative loans and grants support established forest village cooperatives to improve the cooperation’s capacity,
       gain greater value-added for forest villager’s products and increase the level of income of cooperative shareholders.
       Previous successful examples include a trout processing plant, dairy barns and construction equipment. Appendix 1
       provides examples and further details on the terms and conditions.

      Box 3. The Central Union of Forest Villagers Cooperatives (OR-KOOP)

      The Central Union of Turkish Forest Village Cooperatives, ORKOOP, is a unique example of the Labor Union in
      Turkey, founded on July 11, 1997 with the support of 7 Regional Unions of Forestry Cooperatives. ORKOOP was
      created as part of a social security solution to the issues of forest villagers; who are viewed as working under difficult
      conditions often with inadequate equipment and who receive only modest compensation for their labor. Since its
      foundation, ORKOOP’s belief is that forests represent Turkey’s largest natural capital wealth and it works to carry out
      constant communication and cooperation with related institutions as well as defend the economic and social benefits
      of its partners.

      ORKOOP advocates on behalf of forest villagers to ensure their equitable share from forest resources. It participates
      in activities aimed at developing and growing forests to ensure production according to national interests. Main
      activities focus on providing social rights to forestry villagers, and providing training, auditing, and awareness
      raising in forest villages and cooperatives. The majority of the cooperative members of OR-KOOP deal mainly
      with forestry work. Other members also carry out agriculture and animal husbandry work. ORKOOP abides by
      international cooperative principles.

      Sources of funding

      OR-KOOP is funded through established Cooperative Unions in 28 Regional Unions. The State Forest Organizations
      deduct one percent of the proceeds from the annual allowable cut under the heading “Training and Supervision
      Deduction” on behalf of the Cooperative Union. These funds are then transferred to the account of the Regional
      Cooperative Union, with 1% deducted on behalf of OR-KOOP and transferred to the Central Union’s account. This is
      the main source of income for the OR-KOOP Central Union. OR-KOOP holds an annual financial general assembly
      meeting and an elections assembly every four years.

Note: Gross forest income (1a) consists of sales of forest product collection and subsistence value (the imputed income from household consumption of collected forest products).
Forest collection net income is estimated by subtracting cost of transportation and input from collection from gross income.  Agriculture and livestock sales are gross income
because the cost for agriculture and livestock production is not collected in the survey. Total income is the summation of the 8 income items from 1.a to 8, but not including 1b.

9	 There is a long-standing debate about which is the better measure of standards of living. For developing countries, a strong case can be made for preferring consumption,
    based on both conceptual and practical considerations (Deaton and Grosh, 2000). The poverty analysis uses income as a welfare measure because of unavailability of
    consumption data. The seasonality issue associated with income data, to some extent, is lessened as the income covers the past 12 months.

    line defines monthly food expenditures (hunger limits) for a healthy, balanced and adequate nutrition for a "four-person family" and is TL 1,370. The total amount of other
    monthly expenditures required for clothing, housing (rent, electricity, water, fuel), transportation, education, health and similar needs together with food expenditures (poverty
    limit) amounted to TL 4,461. This is about 1,115 TL /per capita per month (without taking into account equivalent adult scales). The monthly cost of living for a single
    employee was TL 1,704.70 (http://www.turkis.org.tr).
11	 Similarly, Central East Anatolia is ranked the fifth poorest region among forest villages, but has the highest poverty rate using the national survey data.

industrial wood, poorer households collected more firewood
and less industrial wood than non-poor households, and fewer
households sold industrial wood in the market.                                                       Firewood                   Mushroom                   Other

2013 the major exports were thyme (US$56.3 million), bay
leaves (US$32.26 million), sage (US$6.3 million) and plant

and reaped gross sales that were 17 times higher than those of
poorer households. About a quarter of the households surveyed
sold agricultural and horticultural products, with sales from
tobacco being the most profitable (despite being collected by
only 1% of households), followed by tea, olives and apricots.




12	 Respondents were asked to list the non-wood forest products they collected - and in some cases they listed agricultural or horticultural products. This could have been a
    misunderstanding of the question in classifying products. Therefore, we cannot presume that these are the only agricultural and horticultural products collected by households.

across the income spectrum depend on forests for their energy                             than average in the last 10 years. The primary reason for
needs; approximately 95% of SEHS sampled use fuelwood                                     planting woodlots across households was for food. Secondary
and 43% use charcoal (as seen in Table 4‑1 below). However,                               concerns included soil fertility and carbon sequestration.
differences exist in their method of procurement (with non-poor
more likely to purchase) as well as their use. Poorer households                          A fifth of households engaged in pasture management
depend on fuelwood for cooking and heating water almost                                   with no significant differences between poor and non-poor
twice as much as non-poor households. This possibly reflects                              households, apart from the average land size managed by
their lack of access to modern energy sources, such as                                    households. Pasture land was used mainly for grazing, and
electricity and gas.                                                                      marginally for cropping.

food production, timber and other economic benefits (Brack et          communities, households and women’s rights to forest access

                                                                       benefits accrue to the poor (see Box 5 below).




       Box 5. P.R.I.M.E. - Pathways Toward Prosperity

       Five broad pathways can help launch the forest-dependent poor onto a sustainable path toward prosperity. These
       pathways, referred to as PRIME, identify economic development strategies and build on the premise that forests
       themselves remain intact.

       PRODUCTIVITY: Growth in labor and resource productivity (P) is integral to economic development. In forested
       landscapes, labor productivity can be improved by enhancing individual and community skills in sustainable forest
       management. Resource productivity can be improved through the infusion of capital (for instance, portable saw mills),
       forest fire and pest management or tree plantations. Associated technologies, policies and capacity strengthening
       activities need to meet the requirements of women, indigenous people and other marginalized households to ensure
       that the poorest benefit.

       RIGHTS: Wealth accumulation is an essential pathway out of poverty. One strategy is to increase the wealth of
       the poor by strengthening their rights (R) over natural capital. A large body of literature and local environmental
       movements point to the importance of community rights to using and selling forest resources in the reduction of
       poverty. Within forested communities, it is particularly important to empower women and other marginalized
       individuals to have tenure rights and decision-making power.

       INVESTMENTS: Poverty reduction in forested landscapes will not be possible without investments (I) in complementary
       institutions and public services. Forest-related pathways to prosperity are only likely if the poor also have inclusive and
       affordable access to complementary public services such as education, health, agricultural extension, transportation
       and mobile phone access. The role of gender-responsive institutional arrangements in providing information,
       enabling local level innovation and offering insurance against down-side risks will be important.

       MARKETS: Income generation and diversification require the strengthening of small and medium timber and non-
       timber enterprises and increasing their access to markets (M). Markets for a small number of high-value non-timber
       forest products (e.g. Brazil or Shea nuts) are one example of a pathway that is likely to be more beneficial to women.
       Timber certification and export markets for timber offer an alternate broader approach. This pathway may need
       careful designing to be responsive to the preferences of women, indigenous households and youths, as well as
       conservation requirements.

       ECOSYSTEMS: Ecosystems and their hidden services (E) are integral to prosperity. Over the last decades, policy
       instruments such as eco-tourism, payments for eco-system services and carbon markets have proven to be useful
       mechanisms to regulate ecosystem services and their benefits. It is important to channel this demand for ecosystem
       services into monetary and non-monetary support for the poor, and, women within poor households.

       Box 6. Targeting Development Programs around the World

       One of the key components of program development is to concentrate resources on “target groups” of poor or
       vulnerable households. Based on a review of experiences and lessons learnt from 122 antipoverty programs/projects
       in 47 transition and developing countries, Coady, Grosh and Hoddinott (2004), conclude that targeting has the
       potential to increase the effectiveness of these programs. Targeting is particularly important for the transfer of programs
       that constitute safety nets to address vulnerability, but the choice of targeting methods must be driven by local context.

       The recognition of the important linkages between poverty and vulnerability has led to a dramatic expansion in the
       number of developing countries that have established relatively large cash transfer programs focused on society’s
       low income and excluded groups (Hanlon, Barrientos and Hulme, 2010). Social protection programs cover public
       transfers, in cash or in kind, to protect and raise the consumption of the poorest households. Fiszbein et al. (2014)
       estimated that social protection programs are currently preventing 150 million people from falling into poverty.

       However, development programs that aim to simultaneously improve social as well as ecological protections remain
       very few. Some examples include public employment programs, such as India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
       Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), South Africa’s Working for Water program, and the Brazilian Bolsa
       Verde program which links an existing social protection program (Bolsa Família) with a scheme of Payment for

       One of the world’s largest social protection programs, Bolsa Verde, has been implemented in many extractive
       reserves and forests in Brazil where rural poverty was widespread. In 2011, the Ministry of Environment collaborated
       with the Ministry of Social Development to create Bolsa Verde as part of the Brazil Without Extreme Poverty Plan,
       which distributed $34 million to 44,388 households. Bolsa Verde provides households with social security support
       and guaranteed quarterly income combined with training and technical support, in exchange for a household’s
       contribution to various activities linked to forest management and conservation.

Note: The income model is in semi-log form, therefore, the estimated coefficients (times 100), represent a percent change in income for unit increase in the covariates (in the case
of continuous variables) and discrete change (in the case of dummy variables). For example, col (7) for total income, 0.13*, means that, on average, households belonging to
cooperatives, earn a 13% higher total income, compared with non-member households, all other factors being the same.
