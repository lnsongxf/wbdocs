Foreword



Modern and efficient seaports are ever more important for Africa to seize opportu-
nities from international trade. Without frequent and reliable cost-effective ship-
ping services, African exports will be less competitive and the continent less attrac-
tive for investors. As UNCTAD 1 data on transport costs and liner shipping connec-
tivity show, Africa still pays more for the transport of its international trade, and
most countries on the continent have relatively low levels of maritime transport
connectivity.

But improvements are on the way. African countries are advancing with trade facil-
itation reforms as well as port reforms, and infrastructure investments in their sea-
ports have caught up with other continents. Latin American and Asian countries
had already in the 1990s and 2000s invested heavily in their seaports, initially with
“brownfield” reforms in Latin America, and mostly new “greenfield” ports in Asia.
As shown by the recent study of the World Bank Container Terminals Concessions –
Making the Most of Ports in West Africa (World Bank Report ACS17308), important
improvements have now also been achieved in Africa.

However, not all operational and cost improvements achieved in African ports have
been passed on to the shipper in terms of lower prices or better services. It is for this
reason that concessions need to be better planned and implemented. The present
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines are a very timely and helpful contribu-
tion in this regard.

Most African ports largely serve their own national hinterland, with few clients in
neighboring countries. Inter-port competition is limited due to low levels of trade
and transit facilitation, obstacles at border crossings, and no common regional mar-
kets for trucking transport services. Many ports are thus de facto in a monopolistic
position, with little alternative choices for importers and exporters. It is important
for policy makers to carefully plan private sector participation in such situations.

This is especially the case in the current environment, where container ports are
confronted with ever larger ships and changing alliances among carriers. The Con-
tainer Terminals Concession Guidelines will help port authorities and ministries of
transport and infrastructure to take decisions on alternative concession schemes,
time frames, and the timely planning of extensions.

Two African port associations, the Port Management Association of West and Cen-
tral Africa (PMAWCA) and the Port Management Association of Eastern and
Southern Africa (PMAESA), requested the support of the SSATP to develop guide-
lines on container terminal concessions that provide strategic and practical advice
to high level government decision-makers and general managers of port authorities,
in their endeavor to attract professional private sector partners to invest in and op-
erate container terminal facilities.

The Container Terminal Concession Guidelines was developed by SSATP. Marc Juhel,
consultant and former Transport Practice Manager at the World Bank is the main
author, with inputs from Yaya Yedan, SSATP Regional Integration pillar leader,

Preliminary Considerations


Port container terminals are important to efficiently accommodate external trade
flows in many countries around the world, and are considered critical for African
countries engaged in improving the overall competitiveness of their economies.
However, ports are just a node in the logistics chains linking the African continent
to the world and if optimizing this node is important, it is far from being sufficient.
Adequate attention also needs to be paid to the whole transport chain, in particular
the inland logistics segment. This necessity becomes obvious when looking at the
typical costs distribution for transporting a 20-foot or 40-foot container between
Europe and a landlocked African country, which shows port handling amounting
to less than 10% of the total costs in most cases (see example below). Even if this
share may be slightly higher for a coastal country, it will remain noticeably less than
the cost of both shipping and land transport. Coastal countries can indirectly impact
sea freight tariffs by offering very cost-efficient calls to shipping lines. While this
should be a key objective of any container terminal concession, governments have
other means at their disposal to lower inland logistics costs. Improved road infra-
structure, higher market contestability, as well as enhanced cross-border facilitation
measures should be used as part of a broader strategy to increase competition be-
tween regional logistics chains, and consequently to exercise a downward pressure
on inland transport costs.

The container terminal industry in Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a changing envi-
ronment – much less predictability and greater uncertainties on expected volumes.
The containerization of its trades was largely complete by the time the first wave of
concession deals took place (concession of the container terminal in Dar es Salaam,
management contract for the port of Djibouti, and concession of the port of Ma-
puto, all in 2000). From 2000 to 2015, container traffic growth was supported by the
strong economic growth in the continent at a time when the elasticity of trade to
gross domestic product (GDP) was much greater than 1. Even the world crisis of
2008-2009 was just a temporary and short lived pause in what was largely perceived
as an unending period of growth.

In such a context, concessions for brownfield terminals were straightforward
enough, as the base traffic at the time of the concession could only grow, allowing
the incoming operator to modernize the equipment and the terminal with the cash
generated by the revenue of the concession. The strong growth prospects also
prompted further development of greenfield ports already in operation (Doraleh in
Djibouti, starting operations in December 2008, Coega in South Africa, starting op-
erations in October 2009), or still at blueprint stage (Lekki and Badagry in Lagos
Nigeria, for instance).

However, the commodity crisis hitting oil and mining products exporting countries
from 2015 onwards on one hand, and the decoupling of trade growth from GDP
growth which now sees trade growing slower than GDP on the other hand, com-
bined with the relative scarcity of available seafront in existing container terminals
are now conspiring together to make future port development both more expensive
and far riskier.

The industry is also shifting from brownfield terminals to greenfield developments.
Terminal operation concessionaire and port authorities have expanded the capacity
of existing terminals by investing heavily into modern handling equipment, adding
ship-to-shore (STC) gantry cranes, densifying the container yard through rubber-
tired gantry (RTG) operation or expanding container yard space by converting ad-
jacent breakbulk yards. However, there are limits to the number of cranes that can
be added along the existing berths, and any significant capacity development in fu-
ture will need to be on new berths within the existing port limits (TC2 in Abidjan,
Berth 19 in Mombasa), or in completely new sites (Lekki and Badagry in Nigeria,
Lamu in Kenya, or the dig-out extension of Durban).

As a result, the magnitude of investments is several orders higher than just in cranes,
from a couple of hundred million dollars for new berths within a port to a couple
of billion dollars if a new marine infrastructure needs to be created.

Furthermore, the investment amount is not the only added complexity in greenfield
terminals, it is also the difference in the cash flow profile. In brownfield terminals,
terminal operation concessionaires generally operate with a positive cash flow
throughout the concession, financing the upgrades in the handling equipment from
the revenue. In greenfield developments, the investment comes first, and it is only
several years later that the terminal can finally enter into operation and start gener-
ating revenue to reimburse the invested capital expenditure.

This will often imply for concessionaires and port authorities the need to resort to
debt financing at a time when lenders, increasingly concerned about the uncertain-
ties on future levels of activity, will tend to require a higher percentage of equity
financing to close the deal. It will also create substantial contingent public financial
liabilities as governments will be exposed to the full costs and liabilities of certain
force majeure events or early termination scenarios that neither private operators
nor private lenders will accept to endorse.




                                                                                      xvii
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Finally, governments need to do their homework and set realistic ambitions for the
project like regional gateway versus hub versus local economy. Because past conces-
sions largely managed to successfully transform dilapidated terminals into modern
facilities while generating revenue for the port authorities and the governments, and
in certain cases, increased transshipment activities, many ports now harbor ambi-
tions to become regional hub, or become the sole gateway for their landlocked hin-
terland. The inherent optimism underpinning infrastructure investment plans is
common in the transport sector, and by far not only for ports, but it remains nev-
ertheless necessary for governments and port authorities to take fully into account
the regional context in their traffic forecasts. In particular, it is advisable to keep in
mind that developing a transshipment hub requires a minimum level of certainty
about the commitment of a shipping line to channel a significant enough traffic
through the terminal (refer for instance to the initial plans of MSC shipping com-
pany to use San Pedro as transshipment hub for West Africa, before switching to
Lomé).

1. Background



Why are those Guidelines needed?

The decision, by a national government or a port authority, to contract out the de-
velopment and operation of a container terminal facility to a qualified private op-
erator sets in motion a process involving relationships with quite a different set of
players compared to traditional port operations and management. It also most often
requires a change in the function of the port authority, either from service provider
to regulator, or from licensing authority to long-term contract manager, or a mix of
both. Whatever the specific local conditions in play, this means a clear evolution in
the respective roles of the public and private players having to work together to de-
liver the services expected by the clients of the port and the national economy at
large.

Effectively dealing with experienced private container terminal operators requires
public counterparts, port authorities and government administrations, to master
the legal and institutional skills necessary to reach balanced and profitable arrange-
ments for their countries. Even when the required legal framework has been thor-
oughly established, existing institutions may find it hard to adjust to dealing with
partners whose short-term objectives may not at first sight coincide systematically
with the long-term policy goals of public authorities. However, past and current
experience does show that both can be preserved, provided both sides have the tools
and skills needed to reach an effective contractual agreement. Not surprisingly, as
this is the nature of the markets they have been operating in, private operators will
bring to the negotiation table very strong legal competencies and experienced nego-
tiating skills. Since these skills were not so much required to deliver their usual man-
date so far, many port authorities may lack at the outset a comparable capacity.
While on-the-job training will definitely be part of the learning process, specialized
assistance by transaction management professionals is often warranted. The Guide-
lines will identify key areas that typically may need support to ensure a successful
outcome.

Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




These Guidelines do not intend to summarize or replace the various books and
toolkits that exist and provide valuable insights and knowledge on the port conces-
sioning process 2. Instead, they will refer to those sources for generic information on
definitions and processes, and will focus primarily on highlighting critical steps,
contract provisions, or contract management tools, which need particular attention
throughout a concessioning journey. Whenever available, illustrative examples will
be provided.


Definition and content of a port concession agreement

The World Bank Group defines a concession as “An arrangement whereby a private
party (concessionaire) leases assets from an authorized public entity (grantor) for a
defined period and has responsibility for financing specified new fixed investments
during the period and for providing specified services associated with the assets; in
return, the concessionaire receives specified revenues from the operation of the as-
sets; the assets revert to the public sector at expiration of the contract” (World Bank
Port Reform Toolkit).

Concession including new infrastructure construction (BOT and variants)

Terminal infrastructure financing and construction as part of a concession contract
can come in a number of different contractual arrangements, Build-Operate-Trans-
fer, Build-Own-Operate-Transfer, Build-Transfer-Operate, Design-Build-Finance-
Operate, etc. These variants imply specific provisions in the tendering process as
well as in the concession contract itself. The World Bank Port Reform Toolkit offers
a list of detailed definitions of these arrangements. For container terminals, two var-
iants in particular are often used:
       BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER (BOT): Legal title to the newly constructed port
       infrastructure, and sometimes other assets, remains with the government
       or the port authority until the end of the concession period. The conces-
       sionaire concludes a long-term leasehold agreement, which conveys rights
       similar to holding title over the land.



2   Two useful pieces of work are worth mentioning: (i) The World Bank Port Reform Toolkit
     Edition 2006, available on the eLibrary of the World Bank Group and (ii) Les Concessions
     Portuaires by Jean Grosdidier de Matons, Editions EMS, 2012, available on line at editions-
     ems.fr.

                                                               The Concessioning Process




    BUILD-OWN-OPERATE-TRANSFER (BOOT): It is also possible that a legal ti-
    tle for the land is acquired directly by the concessionaire. Under a BOOT
    model, the parties agree to have title over all assets that are passed to the
    government at the end of the concession.

Concession of operations (with or without equipment financing)
Operational concessions may take the characteristics of a leasehold on a defined port
area, complemented with performance objectives to ensure optimal utilization of a
scarce public resource. If the concession includes equipment financing, it must spec-
ify whether the equipment remains under the ownership of the operator at the end
of the concession or if it is transferred to the port authority, and under which con-
ditions.


Different scopes of a port concession

Concession of a specialized terminal

Most concession contracts involve a single specialized terminal facility. Container
terminals, dry bulk and liquid bulk terminals make the greatest proportions of those
contracts. However, bulk terminals are frequently concessioned and operated as
part of broader vertically integrated industrial logistics chains, whereas container
terminals are mostly stand-alone facilities. Corresponding concession contracts re-
flect this distinction accordingly, particularly in terms of performance criteria and
monitoring arrangements.

Concession of a whole port (with delegation of public authority)

In this formula, two distinct agreements are packaged into one: (i) a commercial
contract that basically includes the provisions of a traditional concession, and (ii)
an administrative agreement that delegates specific public authority mandates to the
operator. Control and monitoring of this kind of contract requires a double level of
supervision on both the operational and regulatory sides. In particular, the recourse
options against regulatory decisions by the concessionaire must be explicitly spelled

Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Objectives of a container terminal concessioning process

The decision to concession out a container terminal must be reached based on ex-
plicit objectives, which will guide a number of critical decisions in the process, like
selection criteria, key performance indicators, monitoring tools and remedies.

Operational efficiency and innovation

Efficiency improvements and opening up to innovative practices should usually be
at the core of a port concessioning process. Irrespective of other potential objectives,
efficiency and innovations should always be explicitly pursued and contractual pro-
visions should provide a clear incentive structure towards these goals. The main ra-
tionale for these lay in the need to optimize utilization of existing public assets and
of any development that will ultimately revert to the port authority. This approach
ensures the best cost-efficient use of public investments in the port and in collateral
assets.

Port costs reduction

In parallel with efficiency improvements, bringing port costs down is the natural
complement of operational rationalization. It comes back to the core mission of the
port system, which is to serve the domestic economy by providing efficient sea/land
transfer services at the least possible cost. While ports can and often offer a broader
array of services, it must remain the first critical objective of any port, and a conces-
sion operation must help achieving it. Pursuing this objective implies having first a
reliable assessment of actual port costs in the present situation, and a good under-
standing of the potential for costs reduction in the terminal operating structure.
This potential will then have to be mobilized, both in the bidding/negotiation pro-
cess itself, and in the monitoring of key performance indicators of the concession.
This is also an area where users’ feedback is of paramount importance, to avoid sit-
uations where costs get just transferred to other parts of the port system, with little
meaningful impact in final analysis for port users.

Finance mobilization

Concessions are sometimes viewed by governments or public authorities as a means
to access infrastructure financing options outside the fiscal constraints of national
budgets. But private and commercial financing is practically always more costly than
traditional public funding, and worthwhile only when it makes the attainment of
the efficiency and port costs reduction objectives possible. Care should also be taken

to avoid subscribing to contingent liabilities over the concession period, which have
the potential to significantly undermine the financial bottom line of the operation
for public authorities. In any case, a concession should not be construed primarily
as a source of alternative funding for long-term terminal infrastructure, at the ex-
pense of efficiency improvements and, in particular, of a sustainable reduction in
costs for port users.

Revenues optimization

While it is legitimate for the concessioning authority to ensure full cost recovery of
incurred expenses in building the assets to be concessioned or in preparing the area
to be developed by the concessionaire, and to get a fair remuneration of its invest-
ments, care should be taken to avoid turning a port concession into a cash cow for
public finances. This would come in all likelihood at the expense of the port costs
reduction objective, and consequently result in an additional tax on the economy as
a whole. However, if a port authority, because of special circumstances, still intends
to select a concessionaire based on an income maximization criterion, it should do
so while simultaneously focusing on two collateral aspects: (i) factoring in the ex-
pected operational improvements, assess the final costs to be borne by the terminal’s
users, and assess what these costs would be should the expected operational im-
provements fail to materialize; and (ii) develop an allocation plan for use of the ad-
ditional resources generated by the concession (over and above the costs of conces-
sioned assets referred to above), which should be primarily, if not exclusively, de-
voted to further modernize or extend port capacity in line with expected demand.

Facilitate port growth and development
This is a generic objective that must be construed as part of the optimization of the
port sector contribution to the national economy. In this context, it may include
valuing the additional networking opportunities the concessionaire may bring to
the maritime connectivity of the country through its relationships with shipping
lines and foreign terminals, or its capacity to contribute to the development of spe-
cial economic zones and improve the domestic investment climate, therefore help-
ing bringing more activities and employment around the port area. While this ob-
jective may be formally added to any of the previous ones, one should realize its
translation into practical evaluation criteria is likely to remain subjective and prone
to exaggeration, so it should probably be construed more as an overall background
goal than as an objective assessment tool when it comes to assessing a possible deal.

2. The Concessioning Process


Before embarking on a concessioning process, care must be taken to clearly identify
the many players, local and international, who may have a stake in the process.
While some will naturally become involved as the operation progresses, the conces-
sioning authority may need to proactively reach out to others to ensure its strategy
and intentions are well understood, and in doing so quell concerns that, if not ad-
dressed early in the process, may stall it at a later stage, if not derail it entirely. Once
stakeholders are all accounted for, a decision will have to be reached as to which
kind of process the concessioning authority intends to follow to select a terminal
operator. This decision will then trigger a series of steps ultimately leading, if suc-
cessful, to the signature of a concession contract.


The players

Governments

Governments have the seminal role of establishing the legal and regulatory frame-
work that will make the concessioning process possible. Beyond that, it is generally
not advisable that they directly enter into concessions agreements with private port
operators, unless the local conditions make it the only practical option (in post-
conflict situations for instance, when the domestic administration is not yet in a
position to issue and manage contracts). There are several practical reasons for this.
Firstly, a government, or a line ministry for that matter, is not the place to manage
contracts on a daily basis, its role is to define strategy, not manage commercial op-
erations. Secondly, by construction it lacks the responsiveness required to answer
requests coming from a market operator, particularly when local authorities have
vested interests in the matter (an example was the early container terminal conces-
sion in Buenos Aires, signed with the Ministry of Transport, where land use issues
for further development involved the municipality and the port authority, leading
to delayed decisions or stalled developments). Finally, it complicates conflict reso-
lution, since any contractual disagreement has to be treated at the ministerial level
instead of locally.




                                                                                          7
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Port authorities

Local port authorities are usually the natural concessioning authorities for container
terminals. They will conduct the concessioning process under the framework de-
fined by the government, either in a port sector law or in a more generic piece of
legislation specifying the procedure to be followed and the requirements to be met
to maximize the benefits for the country. They will be the contractual counterpart
of the private concessionaire and will manage all aspects of the contractual relation-
ship – operational, commercial, and regulatory as needed. Most importantly, it is
highly advisable that they refrain from requiring to be part of the shareholding
structure of the concessionaire. The notion of the port authority being a shareholder
in an operator, even in a minority position, contradicts the landlord port principle
whereby the port authority should not be involved in commercial operations. Fur-
thermore, not only does it create an obvious conflict of interest, but to maintain an
appearance of level playing field the port authority should then be a shareholder at
the same level in all future concessions in the area it manages, which quickly be-
comes impractical. The usual reason invoked has to do with control of the conces-
sionaire, but the good answer to that is a good enforceable contract, competent
monitoring of performance, and willingness to apply remedies when warranted.

Box 1: Risks for a port authority being a shareholder of its terminal operator


    By becoming a shareholder, even on a minority basis, in the concessionaire operating its con-
    tainer terminal, a port authority puts itself in a situation of potential multiple conflicts of interest:
    Strategic development: as traffic grows, the concessionaire’s best interest would be to apply
    for the authorization to expand its facilities so that it remains in a monopoly situation within
    the port area, whereby the port authority’s strategic interest would be to promote competi-
    tion by bringing in another concessionaire when traffic levels make it possible.
    Tariff policy: while the concessionaire’s short term objective is to maximize profit for its share-
    holders, the port authority’s paramount goal is to lower port costs for its clients.
    Customer claims: while the concessionaire’s interest would be to settle a claim quickly and dis-
    creetly, the port authority’s concern should be to hold the concessionaire accountable for any
    wrongdoing, in particular in case of potential discrimination between terminal customers.



Terminal operating companies

The terminal operating companies can be of three different kinds: (i) independent
operators, with no corporate linkages with the shipping lines (Hutchison, ICTSI,
SSA…), (ii) subsidiaries of major shipping lines (APMT, Cosco, TIL, Terminal
Link…), and (iii) operators linked to port authorities (PSA Corporation, DP

kinds, handle about 37% of the world’s container port throughput. Some shipping
lines also operate their own terminals.

Shipping lines

The shipping lines are the direct customers of a terminal. They are mostly interested
in the reliability and cost of calls for their ships. Schedule integrity being a para-
mount requirement of liner services, reliable and consistent container handling
productivity, together with guaranteed timely access to terminals through berthing
window schemes, will be of major concern for them and will guide their choices of
ports of call, in particular for motherships.

Shippers

The shippers are the ultimate consumers of port services, but they are typically not
a party to their organization. Widening the range of shipping services available in
any given port is in their interest, as it will normally increase the competitive pres-
sure on freight rates and simultaneously expand the number of destinations eco-
nomically reachable for products distribution or inputs sourcing. Furthermore, im-
proving the cost efficiency and operational performance of a container terminal is
clearly a strong argument to bring more shipping lines to call at the port. So shippers
will have a vested interest in seeing the concessioning process yield positive results
in terms of productivity increase and costs reduction. They may have a concern
though, if the main or single container terminal of the country is to be concessioned
to a specific shipping line, since fears of possible discrimination risk may deter other
lines from calling at the port and rather serve it through cheaper feeder ships, hence
reducing direct connectivity and making market access and sourcing more difficult.

Port labor

Port workers often entertain legitimate concerns about concessions to the extent
that in many instances, ports have been used in the past by governments as conven-
ient social shelters to provide employment to a number of unskilled or poorly skilled
laborers. As a result, working practices have been slow to evolve, in particular when
modernization of port operations leads to a reduction in operational jobs, which is
typically the case with container handling. Port labor must therefore be closely as-
sociated by port management when initiating a terminal concessioning process, so
that appropriate transition measures are defined and implemented ahead of con-
cluding the deal itself. It is therefore recommended practice to associate port labor
unions early on to the discussions on potential container terminal concessioning.
When there are some reasons to anticipate significant change in manpower require-
ments following the concessioning, forming a special task force with unions’ partic-
ipation to plan ahead for the evolution of the working conditions and jobs on the
terminal is advisable (see World Bank Port Reform Toolkit Module #7).


International competition versus direct contracting

When considering the option to concession out a container terminal, port authori-
ties have basically two main options: (i) organize an international tendering process,
or (ii) contract directly through negotiations with a known partner of the port or
with an entity having submitted and unsolicited bid.

Benefits of international competition
The paramount concern of governments and public authorities when entering any
kind of public-private partnership arrangement, like a container terminal conces-
sioning process, is to ensure, and demonstrate to their constituents, that it will pro-
duce value for money, i.e. they will get more out of it compared to what they were
getting with the traditional public operated system, and hopefully at a better price.
To this end, they must convince all stakeholders that the commercial partner they
will select is indeed the most capable of producing this outcome. A very effective
way to go about this is to organize an open international competition. If properly
managed, it will mechanically ensure the port is getting the best possible partner at
this particular point in time. It will also avoid the suspicion that almost systemati-
cally comes in case of a direct negotiation with a single project sponsor. And as ex-
posed before, a number of players are available today to compete for these conces-
sion contracts. So whenever possible, organizing an international tendering process




                                                                                     11
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




should be the preferred option to seek a professional operator for a container ter-
minal.

Direct contracting
Apart from the usual misgivings about the optimization of contract conditions, di-
rect contracting may also risk losing an opportunity for the port to avail itself of
innovative solutions that may come up during an open consultation process. How-
ever, a sub-optimal agreement where a good deal of the financial benefits gets cap-
tured by the concessionaire at the expense of port users is by far the greatest risk.
There are cases, however, where direct contracting may make sense, provided ap-
propriate safeguards are implemented:
      When an existing facility, so far operated under the “tool port” model with private
       stevedores, is turned into a full-fledged container terminal (see Box 2): The in-
       cumbent operators may then form a consortium to negotiate with the port au-
       thority a concession contract replacing the typical operating license they were
       operating under. In such a case, the port authority should, in principle, be well
       equipped for this negotiation, since it will be expected to have a deep knowledge
       of the costs involved in the operations to date, as well of the costs involved in
       both transforming and operating the new facility. Simultaneously, the incum-
       bent operators, because of their inherent detailed knowledge of the local con-
       ditions, may be expected to put forward a competitive proposal. In any case, a
       comprehensive understanding by the port authority of the costs of the new op-
       eration and of the appropriate productivity targets to be met by the concession-
       aire is a must for the direct negotiation of a concession contract to be successful
       for both parties.

Box 2: Nigeria direct contracting concessions

  In 2004, the authorities established a new legal and regulatory framework that made it possible
  to convert the Nigeria Ports Authority into a true landlord port agency and set up the independ-
  ent Regulatory Commission. Bid documents were issued in four rounds in 2004 and 2005, leading
  eventually to the award of twenty-five terminal concessions. While thirteen were concessioned
  through a competitive process, another twelve were so through direct negotiations.
  These negotiations involved the local companies having been operating the terminals so far,
  with or without the participation of new international partners. Ultimately, two concessions were
  awarded to local groups, and the other ten went to consortia made of the original local operators
  joined by international companies.

   When a shipping line, or a consortium including a shipping line, comes forward
     with a proposal to build and operate a new greenfield container terminal, possibly
     aiming also at transshipment activities (see Box 3): Since the project is usually
     part of the line’s commercial development strategy, it may not lend itself to
     optimization via an international competitive tendering process. However, the
     port authority must still consider how to optimize its outcome as far as the
     national economy is concerned. Two considerations are paramount here: (i)
     assess the proposal against any alternative use that could have been considered
     for the project location (coastal land is a scarce resource and must be carefully
     managed by national authorities), and (ii) ensure the proposal will deliver the
     best possible results for the country, both financially (return on concessioned
     assets, i.e. land), and economically (cost efficiency of services to port clients).
     An additional issue may come into play when the project intends to serve pri-
     marily, and sometimes exclusively, the shipping line that sponsors it. In such a
     case, and when a common user terminal already exists in the vicinity, the port
     authority’s concern should be to assess whether the withdrawal of this shipping
     line from the existing terminal may make the present operation no longer via-
     ble. Maintaining a common user terminal available to all port clients is obvi-
     ously a must (apart from situations where traffic is large enough for each ship-
     ping line to operate its own terminal, as on the US West Coast).

Box 3: Lomé Container Terminal in Togo

 Further to an initial concession contract negotiated in 2001, Bolloré Africa Logistics (BAL) was
 awarded in 2010 a 35-year concession to operate the Container Togo Terminal. In March 2011,
 the extension work for Togo Terminal was launched, for an additional quay of 450 meters and 16
 hectares of yard space, which became operational in October 2014.
 However, a second concession was signed in December 2008 for the development of a new
 greenfield container terminal with Lomé Container Terminal (LCT). LCT is owned by Thesar Mari-
 time Limited, a Cyprus subsidiary of Global Terminal Limited (GTL), a sister company of Terminal
 Investment Limited (TIL), the terminal operating arm of MSC. GTL was absorbed in 2012 by TIL,
 while China Merchant Holding International (CMHI) acquired a share of 50% in Thesar Maritime
 Limited (TML) in August 2012. The final shareholders of LCT are therefore now TIL/MSC and CMHI,
 holding 50% each. The duration of the concession is 35 years, with an option for 10 more years.
 The terminal is a multi-user facility, not reserved for MSC, and mainly devoted to transshipment
 operations. The Terminal entered into service in October 2014. The second phase of the devel-
 opment of LCT will enable it to reach a capacity of 2 million TEUs, with a maximum vessel size of
 14,000 TEUs. As of beginning of 2015, LCT operates with 12 STS (ship-to-shore crane). So far the
 activity is promising and transshipment is picking up.

Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Unsolicited proposals

As a rule, unsolicited proposals must be handled carefully to avoid any misinterpre-
tation by other stakeholders, whatever the outcome of the proposal. Openness and
transparency must be brought into the process despite the possible confidentiality
requirements expressed by the sponsor. Should the government or port authority
find the proposal may have merit, an advisable way to move the process forward
would be to reinject a modicum of competition in it using a Swiss Challenge formula.

The Swiss Challenge is a procurement method whereby a public authority, having
received an unsolicited bid and found some technical merit in it, publishes the tech-
nical component of the original bid and asks for counter financial proposals. Should
a new bidder bid lower for the same technical content, the original bidder is given a
chance to match this new bid, in which case he is awarded the contract, but if he
declines, the contract goes to the new lowest bidder. This formula actually works as
a market test to ascertain the cost/quality ratio of unsolicited proposals.

When a port authority contemplates the possibility of accepting an unsolicited bid,
without putting it through a Swiss Challenge, it must go back to the two paramount
considerations highlighted above (see paragraph on Direct contracting). It is critical,
in particular, for the port authority to be able to assess the realism and reliability of
the cost structure of the proposal, for both the construction and operation phases,
and to determine the adequacy of the proposed performance objectives by compar-
ison with the regional competitors, to ensure the resulting combination of tariff and
productivity will be an attractive option for present and future line customers. Yard-
stick benchmarking is therefore imperative in such a situation to avoid settling for
a sub-optimal outcome.


Organizing an international tendering process

Sequence and timeline
Establishing a comprehensive and realistic timeline at the outset of the process is
important to identify all the tasks to be taken care of and get a good handle on the
overall organization of the project. For both credibility and transparency, it is im-
portant not to underestimate the time required to effectively complete every step of
the process. Over ambitious timelines will unavoidably backfire and lead to criticism
of the implementing authority for supposed lack of efficiency, whereas it was most
likely just over-optimism. But the consequence will be just as harmful. So better

assess as reasonably as possible the time needed at each step of the way, paying par-
ticular attention to the approval stages, where clearance to move forward will be
expected from public authorities. To the extent possible, past records of government
approval sequences should guide the elaboration of the overall project timeline. The
concessioning authority will hardly be criticized for completing the process earlier
than planned, but most surely if the reverse happens. Once a timeline has been de-
termined, it should be made public so that all stakeholders and interested parties are
aware of the project status and of its anticipated milestones.

Figure 3 compares timelines for several concessions. The comparatively long time
period to put in place the concession in Tin Can Island and the first Abidjan Ter-
minal can be explained by the circumstances surrounding the concession: the pro-
cess in Abidjan was interrupted by the civil unrest in 2002 and resumed on a nego-
tiated basis, while in Lagos, Tin Can Island was part of a series of concessions that
required additional time to assess. At the other end of the spectrum, Cotonou ben-
efitted from an extensive preparation phase, while the delayed entry into operation
was linked to the construction work for the new terminal which was funded under
the Millennium Challenge Account. Overall, depending on review and approval pe-
riods by public authorities, a total transaction period lasting between 12 and 18
months looks like a reasonable estimate.

As an initial guidance, it is reasonable to anticipate the following timeline when
starting the process from scratch.

Overall, depending on review and approval periods by public authorities, a total
transaction period lasting between 12 and 18 months is a reasonable estimate.

Term of the proposed concession contract
Determining the term of the proposed concession is a critical element, since it will
decide the length of the contractual commitment between the authority and the op-
erator. The first question could actually be whether it should be decided upfront by
the concessioning authority, and therefore be an input into the tendering process,
or should it be left for the bidders to propose, as a variable element to be assessed




16
                                                                The Concessioning Process




alongside the other evaluation criteria identified in the tender documents. At this
point, it is worth bearing in mind:

    FROM THE CONCESSIONING AUTHORITY’S STANDPOINT, the shorter the
    term is, the more often it will have the opportunity to re-open the com-
    petition for the market and consequently, to incentivize the incumbent
    to keep up its performance to justify getting a term extension.

    FROM THE OPERATOR’S STANDPOINT, the longer the term is, the easier it is
    to plan for the development of the facility and the more comfortable it is
    to secure longer term financing backed by the expected revenues of the
    operations.

As a sensible rule, the term of the concession must match the depreciation period of
the assets the concessionaire is required to invest in. It flows from this that the term
could be rather short for a brownfield concession of a fully equipped terminal al-
ready in complete operational order, where the operator will just have to maintain
the equipment and possibly invest in limited renewals, say between 5 to 10 years.
Conversely, when the operator is asked to build and fully equip a greenfield facility,
the size of the investment will lead to a longer contract, the experience suggests con-
cession terms varying between 20 and 30 years.

So when it comes to choosing between the concession term being an input or a var-
iable, the concessioning authority, based on its assessment of the investment costs
involved and of the expected traffic to be handled at the terminal, may find it more
practical to define the term for which it is seeking an operator. Otherwise, the risk
exists that the bidders will be tempted to ask for longer terms than the above-men-
tioned rule would suggest, and even if the authority may specify it, it will give pref-
erence to shorter term submissions, factoring in this criterion in the bid evaluation
methodology, alongside tariff, royalties, and income flows, which may prove chal-
lenging while simultaneously maintaining transparency and objectivity in the selec-
tion process.

Administration and management

A core team must be put in charge of the process under the direct supervision of the
office of the general manager of the port authority. The team will allocate tasks,
monitor progress, take action to resolve issues as they crop up, and keep the port
management informed at all times about the progress of the operation. At the very
outset of the project, a decision has also to be made as to whether it would be helpful




                                                                                      17
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




to hire specialized advisers to help in organizing and conducting the concessioning
process. One arm of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World
Bank Group, is devoted to providing transaction advisory services of this kind. If
there is agreement that some professional advice is warranted, two options are ba-
sically available to the concessioning authority: (i) contract out the whole process,
tendering, evaluation, award proposal, negotiations and closing, to a transaction ad-
viser who will then work under the control of the authority, but be in charge of all
the steps and sequencing actions required to move the process to its ultimate con-
clusion, or (ii) hire only the specific professional help required, like for instance a
legal adviser experienced in preparing and negotiating concession contracts. It is
worth bearing in mind that the potential bidders for a container terminal conces-
sion, be it independent terminal operators or shipping lines, will come to the nego-
tiation table well equipped in legal capacity and negotiating experience, and it is of
paramount importance that the concessioning authority be able to avail itself of an
equivalent ability to improve the likelihood of reaching a balance agreement by the
end of the process 4. Finally, it is paramount to understand that following negotia-
tions, if and when a concessionaire must seek out commercial debt, he may have to
seek subsequently further modifications to the concession contract in order to meet
commercial lenders’ obligations. This process will invariably tax further the ability
of the conceding authority to negotiate a concession contract, and it will often in-
volve the negotiation of a direct agreement between lenders and the host govern-
ment, as lenders will seek to ensure that local authorities cannot deny after the fact
both their rights and obligations taken by public companies and/or regulatory au-
thorities.

Procurement notice and advertisement

The first official communication of the port authority’s intention to select a conces-
sionaire for one of its terminals must be widely disseminated through both domestic
media networks and international publications covering the port and shipping in-
dustries. The procurement notice must provide the initial provisional timetable for

the operation, as well as the firm timeline expected for the request for prequalifica-
tion, with information on how to collect prequalification documents and on the
submission deadline.

Rules of information disclosure

Throughout the process, a member of the core team will be designated to communi-
cate with the media and to answer questions about the progress of the operation.
Proactively, the port authority will release, preferably on its website, all information
on the characteristics of the project and on the procurement process being followed.
Regular updates on progress, in particular when pre-identified milestones are
reached, will be published accordingly.


Prequalification criteria

Generally speaking, the prequalification criteria must be aligned with the scale of
the project, so as to ensure the potential capacity of bidders to deliver the expected
results, but without being overly demanding and so unreasonably restricting the
range of potential competitors.

Professional experience

Professional references will document the capacity of the bidder to manage and op-
erate facilities similar or slightly more important than the one object of the opera-
tion. They will provide information on investments, traffic, productivity and overall
performance, supplemented as the case may be with certificates of appreciation
from concessioning authorities or customers.

Financial references

Financial references will support the ability of the bidder to undertake the expected
investments, and will provide information on the overall financial health of the or-
ganization. They should also include information on ongoing contracts and opera-
tional portfolio, to make it possible to assess whether the new contract is compatible
with the organization and the bidder’s work plan, or if the bidder intends to expand
its operational capacity to take on this assignment, how he plans to go about it.




                                                                                      19
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Relationships with shipping lines

As most of the projects considered in these Guidelines are assumed to be common
user facilities, the issue of shipping lines involvement with terminal operators must
be given adequate attention. On the upside, one might think an operator affiliated
with a line will be in a better position to secure the patronage of its mother company,
and possibly to grow its operations, for instance with transshipment activities. But
on the downside, the risk of preferential treatment perception by other shipping
lines calling at the port must be carefully managed (see section on Clause on non-
discrimination and common user principle). The prequalification documents will
have in particular to indicate whether a shipping line itself would be eligible to par-
ticipate in the tender. As a general rule, if there is no other common user terminal
in the port, it should probably be avoided.

However, it is definitely possible to have a common user terminal run by a profes-
sional operator having an arm-length relationship with a shipping line, provided the
non-discriminatory provisions of the concession contract are compelling and rig-
orously backed-up by a robust user feedback mechanism including appropriate
remedies as needed.


Data requirements and organization

Information disclosure

As a rule, information disclosure on all aspects of the operation should be as broad
as possible. Technical information for bidders should preferably be made available
on a dedicated webpage, where prequalified companies will have protected access
and where they will be able to submit queries. Simultaneously, the port authority
should set up and regularly update a dedicated webpage where all interested parties
and the public at large could track the progress of the concessioning project.

Market studies
Before embarking on the concessioning operation, the port authority will have com-
missioned one or several market studies documenting the prospects of the facility
over the concession period. These studies must be made available to the prequalified
bidders, but specifying that they will remain responsible for their own market as-
sessment of the project, without being able to hold the port authority liable for the
commercial forecasts presented in its studies. If one of the selection criteria involves
traffic projections, like the total discounted revenue throughout the concession period,




20
                                                                The Concessioning Process




then the traffic forecasts proposed by the port authority market studies will be used
to assess this criterion for all submitted bids.

Data room

The port authority will set up a physical/virtual data room, accessible by all prequal-
ified bidders, where all relevant information pertaining to the proposed concession
will be presented. Additionally, a site visit will be organized to allow all prequalified
bidders to get a full physical understanding of the conditions of the terminal to be
concessioned (see section on Bids preparation).


Selection criteria

The selection criteria need to be consistent with the objectives of the concessioning
process, as described earlier. Depending of the preferred objectives, the potential
criteria below will be given differentiated importance and weight.

Business plan

The business plan must outline how the operator intends to meet the performance
criteria requested in the contract (see section on Performance parameters). It will
also describe the operator’s strategy to grow the business of the facility and generally
document his understanding of the role of the terminal, both within the port and
more broadly within the country’s national and regional logistics chain.

Typically, a business plan based on the traffic forecasts provided by the port author-
ity will aim at achieving two main objectives:
   It will describe how the bidder intends to handle expected terminal throughput
    while meeting required performance targets, which is likely to include a depic-
    tion of its operational structure and the evolution of equipment throughout the
    concession period.

   It will offer a vision of its commercial approach with shipping lines in order to
    improve the development prospects of the facility, and of the relationships it
    proposes to build with other logistics players to strengthen and increase the role
    of the container platform nationally, and as the case may be, regionally.

While it is useful for the port authority to get a good overview of the approach of
the bidder to the operational and commercial side of the business—meant to




                                                                                      21
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




demonstrate the candidate’s ability to tackle the specific challenges of the facility to
be concessioned—it is advisable not to read too much into this kind of document,
nor to give it too high a weight if it is part of the overall proposals scoring system.
The risk in doing otherwise would be to turn the competition into some kind of
beauty contest where the presentation skills and other marketing gimmicks would
take precedence over the substantive professional qualities of the bids.

Performance commitments

The bidders will have to commit to the minimum performance requirements
spelled out in the draft concession contract, but the bidding documents may offer
bonus evaluation points to the bidders who commit to higher performance levels,
with the understanding that these higher performance commitments will replace
the original ones in the final contract, and will therefore also become the new thresh-
old triggering penalties in case of non-compliance.

Operational performance targets are advisable in all circumstances, with the follow-
ing comments:

   What the port authority is mostly interested in are outcome-oriented indica-
     tors, irrespective of operational tools put to use. In other words, the key perfor-
     mance indicators must convey a level of commercial achievement, typically
     with the shipping lines that are the direct customers of the terminal and the
     shippers who bring in and pick up containers from the yard. Additional indi-
     cators, like individual equipment productivity ratios, are useful to assess the
     performance of the operator’s assets and its overall organizational efficiency,
     but should not become the primary measures of his performance. Similarly, the
     port authority must be concerned first and foremost with the level of service
     delivered to the customers of the terminal, and not so much with the technical
     means implemented by the operator, provided the required level is met and all
     legal obligations fulfilled. In particular, the concessioning authority should re-
     frain from prescribing the use of specific pieces of handling equipment, in ca-
     pacity and number, as well as demanding a time-bound investment schedule
     committing the operator to replacement and additions of specific units.

   Investment requirements should to the largest possible extent be linked to ca-
     pacity utilization and operational performance, only when there is an obvious
     need, reconstruction or hazard to operate, should they be time-bound. De-
     manding a concessionaire to sign off on a pre-determined, time-bound invest-

                                                                The Concessioning Process




    ment schedule in other circumstances carries at least three risks: (i) that invest-
    ments are made too much ahead of time if demand does not follow forecasts,
    which carries a cost that one way or another will be charged back to the port
    authority, (ii) that investments are made despite sub-optimal productivity of
    existing assets, which removes much incentive to maximize utilization of exist-
    ing infrastructure, and (iii) that the concessionaire prefers to litigate rather than
    comply, arguing for instance that an unexpected economic depression made all
    forecasts irrelevant. The best formula is to include objective triggers in the con-
    cession contract, like reaching 80% of optimal capacity two years in a row, or
    reaching maximum average acceptable waiting times six months in a row (oc-
    cupation ratios are not so much relevant anymore with window-berthing
    schemes), to launch investments operations.

   The competitive situation of the terminal will also have an impact on the rela-
    tive importance of the performance parameters. If the terminal is faced with
    true competitors for most of its expected traffic, the incentive to perform nat-
    urally built-in by this situation makes it less important for the port authority to
    monitor the inner workings of the operator, who is already strongly incentiv-
    ized to optimize its operations, whereas it is critical for the port authority to
    closely follow the performance level offered to customers compared with local
    or regional competitors. When the competition is weak or non-existent, which
    is the case for most container terminals in Sub-Saharan Africa for domestic
    traffic, owing largely to the lack of facilitation of cross-border transport across
    the continent, it becomes necessary for the port authority to ensure not only
    that its customers are well served (rationale for the outcome-oriented indica-
    tors) but also that the port assets under the concession are optimally used (ra-
    tionale for individual equipment and asset productivity indicators).

Examples of various possible performance indicators are presented in section on
Performance parameters.

Traffic commitments
Port authorities are often tempted to require commitments on the volume of traffic
to go through the terminal, in particular when the concessioning project has among
its objectives to develop transshipment and transit activities. Since domestic traffic
is largely contingent on the overall national economic growth, which is obviously
beyond the control of the terminal operator, one can see the apparent rationale for
such a request when these kinds of additional traffic are anticipated. However, in




                                                                                      23
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




most cases the requirement for a container volume commitment is counter-produc-
tive, if not just unreasonable.

Firstly, let’s recognize the obvious that when it comes to independent terminal op-
erators, they just have no control whatsoever on the cargo or on the shipping lines,
so asking them to commit to a certain volume of traffic does not make sense. The
best they can do, and actually have to do to grow their business, is to make their
services as attractive as possible to the lines, on productivity and on price.

Secondly, when it comes to subsidiaries of shipping lines, but operating at arm’s
length from their mother company, and bidding to operate a common user termi-
nal, requiring from them a volume guarantee because of this affiliation runs intui-
tively counter to the principle of non-discrimination to the extent it lets people be-
lieve the operator may be led to give priority to the ships of its related company to
meet this commitment.

Thirdly, volume guarantees will make it harder and maybe costlier for private oper-
ators to raise debt from commercial banks as such commitments inflate the financial
risks taken by the borrower (s).

Ultimately, there is only one case where the requirement for a traffic volume guar-
antee is not only advisable, but sometimes necessary, when a shipping line proposes
to build and operate a container terminal exclusively for its own account. Since the
proposed facility would still be developed on a piece of public land on the shore-
line—always a scarce public resource—the concessioning authority has the respon-
sibility to ensure it will generate enough activity, and create jobs accordingly, to jus-
tify alienating the public domain for the term of the concession.

In final analysis, not even the shipping line owns the traffic, and any kind of traffic
guarantee just creates an additional risk element that the terminal operator will have
to hedge against. And he will do so, in one way or another, by making the port au-
thority, and eventually the terminal users, pay for the cost of this risk. The best way
for the port authority to achieve its goals for a successful concession is not in im-
posing artificial constraints that unavoidably result in additional costs, but in creat-
ing the right incentives for the operator to deliver at its best. These incentives may
include the initial level of investment in the facility, an astute profit-sharing mech-
anism (see the section on Concession fee), and an effective customer feedback loop
(see section on Customer feedback).

Tariffs

If the main objective of the concession is to lower port costs, the main or even only
selection criterion may be the lowest tariff charged to users. Depending on the struc-
ture of the traffic, this criterion may be presented differently (see Table 3):

   If the expected traffic is mostly domestic, the handling charge per TEU for any
     container going through the terminal is the logical criteria.

   If the expected traffic is split between domestic and transshipment flows, bear-
     ing in mind the main objective of lowering port costs for national economic
     actors, the handling charge per TEU for any domestic container going through
     the terminal is the logical criterion, the handling charge for transshipment con-
     tainers can then be left for the operator to decide based on what the market can
     bear given the regional competition context for this traffic.

   If the expected traffic is mostly transshipment, or in cases where the port au-
     thority wants to proactively promote transshipment activities, the bidding doc-
     uments can then unilaterally decide the level of the handling charge for domes-
     tic containers, and make the handling charge for transshipment containers the
     main selection criterion.

Concession fee

The concession payments may be split between an upfront payment and a series of
annual payments. If the annual concession payment is the selection criterion, typi-
cally the upfront payment will be unilaterally decided by the port authority and in-
dicated in the bidding documents. If the latter is chosen as the selection criterion,
the annual concession payment will be decided by the port authority. If both are left




                                                                                                25
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




to be proposed by the bidders, the selection criterion moves toward the total dis-
counted revenue throughout the concession period.

As to the annual concession payment, there will typically be a floor level defined in
the bidding documents, reflecting the lease value for an existing facility or the re-
muneration of the preparatory investments and the land value for a greenfield op-
eration. Topping this floor level may be the selection criterion.

Royalty fee

The royalty fee is an amount per TEU handled which represents a profit sharing tool
between the port authority and the operator. It can be left for the bidder to propose
and become a selection criterion, or it can also be predefined in the bidding docu-
ments, in particular when it is designed as an incentive to grow the traffic of the
facility, for instance using a decreasing scale as traffic grows (see section on Royalty
sliding scale, page 37).

When the royalty fee is the main or the only selection criterion, all other concession
payments, upfront payments and annual fees, are unilaterally defined by the port
authority in the bidding documents. When the royalty fee is left for the bidder to
propose alongside other payments, the selection criterion moves toward the total
discounted revenue throughout the concession period (see below).

Total discounted revenue throughout the concession period

This is usually the preferred criterion when the main objective of the concession is
the optimization of revenues for the port authority. In this case, most revenue items
will be left for the bidders to propose, maybe apart from the floor lease payment.
The port authority should however assess the consequences of any proposed reve-
nue package on the cost for port users, and may decide on a maximum applicable
tariff, in particular for domestic containers, when opting for this criterion.

Summary

For the sake of both transparency and objectivity in the selection process, it is highly
advisable to focus on a limited number of criteria:

      Some qualitative ones used to validate the technical credibility of the proposal:
       (i) the business plan, which should be precise enough to assert the capacity of
       the bidder to deliver on his commitments, but not overly presumptuous, and

                                 (ii) the key minimum performance indicators, to which the bidder must for-
                                 mally commit. If the bidding documents offer the option to propose higher
                                 performance targets, which would become contractual commitments, they
                                 must spell out how bonus evaluation points will be calculated and applied to-
                                 wards the final evaluation results.
      Some quantitative, and preferably one only, to make an objective selection easy
       and undisputable when disclosing the results of the bidding process to all stake-
       holders. The following table sums up the options available to the concessioning
       authority when choosing a single quantitative criterion to select the preferred

Bids preparation

Site visit
The port authority will schedule a comprehensive site visit and questions/answers
session with prequalified bidders. It must take place as early as possible following
the prequalification results. Care must also be taken to leave enough time following
the site visit for the prequalified bidders to prepare their proposals.




                                                                                                                  27
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




Interactions with prequalified bidders

As soon as the prequalified bidders are notified, all information exchanges between
the port authority and the bidders must be conducted in an even fashion, ensuring
a total symmetry of information among all bidders. A transparent way to manage
this is to use a dedicated website to post all transaction relevant information, receive
questions from the bidders, and post answers. An access protected protocol will en-
able bidders to safely visit the site, which will be designed in such a way that ques-
tions of the bidders and answers of the port authority will be viewable by all bidders
simultaneously.


Bids opening

Public opening session
The bids opening session must be public, and all bidders will be invited to attend.
The main elements of the bids in particular:

   the presence of all mandatory elements of the submission, including the bank’s
    bond,
   any performance commitment exceeding the minimum requirements, and
   the quoted value for the selection criteria

will be read aloud and reported in the minutes of the bids opening session, which
will then be posted on the public access section of the website of the port authority.
The bids will then be given to the Bids Evaluation Committee.

Publication of results

The bids evaluation results will be announced publicly by the port authority and
simultaneously posted on its website, together with the full Bids Evaluation Report
showing the ranking of the bidders. The preferred bidder will be invited to negotiate
the concession contract without delay.


Pre-concession documents

The typical pre-concession documents are described in detail in the World Bank
Port Reform Toolkit, 2006 edition. They are just mentioned here for reference.

                                                               The Concessioning Process




Letter of intent (LOI)

The LOI is a pre-concession agreement stating the intention of the concessionaire
to design, construct, or renovate a new or existing port facility, and the willingness
of the port authority to establish terms for a privately operated facility under a con-
cession agreement and to cooperate with the concessionaire in compliance with cer-
tain local requirements (permits, registrations, and qualifications to do business…).
The LOI is prepared in accordance with draft functional specifications that were
originally submitted as part of the bid documentation.

Detailed project report (DPR—for BOT and variants)

The DPR is a document submitted to the port authority as an outline of the func-
tional design or general technical design and time schedules (milestones) for the
various phases of the construction. Once approved by the port authority, the DPR
would be incorporated in the concession agreement, at which point the milestones
become binding.

Joint development agreement (JDA)

When the successful bidder is a consortium of several companies, the JDA is an
agreement among members of the consortium that allocates project responsibilities
(for example, shareholding, financing, construction, or tax advantages). This agree-
ment might also include the port authority itself.


Contract negotiation and award

Negotiation team

The negotiation team will usually be led by the general manager of the port author-
ity, and include its legal counsel, the financial director, the operation director and
the technical director. If an external transaction adviser has been retained by the
authority (see section on Organizing an international tendering process), he/she will
be part of the negotiation team as well.

Issues open to negotiations

The scope of the contract negotiations will have been circumscribed in the bidding
documentation. In particular, it cannot include any element having led to the
award, like financial commitments and performance criteria. It cannot result in any
significant departure from the original conditions of the tendering process. It will




                                                                                     29
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




likely include issues like firming up the contract implementation timetable, fine-
tuning the handover process in case of an existing facility, and confirming the effec-
tiveness conditions of the final agreement.

Negotiation period and conclusion

To avoid dragging along the process, the port authority will define a time window
within which to conclude the negotiations with the preferred bidder. If for a reason
the preferred bidder is not in a position to sign the final agreement by the end of the
defined negotiation period, the port authority may then decide to end the negotia-
tions and invite the second-ranked bidder to negotiate the contract.


Transparency principles throughout the concessioning process

From the initial announcement and publication of the procurement notice to the
final award and signature of the contract, all steps achieved will be reported on the
website of the port authority and regular publications to keep the general public
informed on the progress of the operation. Key documents, including the bidding
documentation, the prequalification report, the bids opening session minutes, the
bids evaluation report, and the final contract award report, will be made available
on the website of the port authority. To the extent it does not include proprietary
information that could be detrimental for the bidder to share, the final concession
contract should also be made public. (Example: TC2 in Abidjan, see Box 4).

3. The Concession Contract



Extensive examples of contract provisions for port concessions are provided in the
World Bank Port Reform Toolkit, Module 4, Legal Tools for Port Reform. This section
will focus on providing examples of wording for critical provisions of any container
terminal concession contract, which require particular attention to ensure a bal-
anced and sustainable agreement can be reached.


Conditions precedent

Conditions to be met by the concessionaire to make the contract effective

Those conditions can be listed in two categories:

   Legal requirements documenting the capacity of the concessionaire to enter the
    contractual agreement: certificate of incorporation, resolution of the board of
    directors approving the contractual commitments made by the concessionaire
    in the project and pre-concession documents.

   Project specific requirements: execution and delivery of the project documents,
    receipt of applicable permits, evidence of required insurance policies, ac-
    ceptance of transferred assets (as the case may be), recognition and formal ac-
    ceptance of the conditions of the concession area (in terms of environmental
    status, climate, geology, hydrology, etc.).

Conditions to be met by the port authority to make the contract effective

Those conditions can be listed in two categories:
   Necessary conditions for the ability of the terminal to operate effectively: ade-
    quate protection and maritime access, including guaranteed draught and
    maintenance dredging schedule; adequate land access and links to land
    transport networks (road and/or rail and waterways).

   Conditions pertaining to the situation of the site as regards the environment
    legislation: the port authority must certify the environmental status of the con-
    cession site; this does not systematically mean it must be fully cleaned or devoid
    of any existing pollutant—often contaminated material is buried beneath con-
    tainer terminals because it is better than moving it. But the status has to be




                                                                                   33
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




     acknowledged as compliant with existing regulations and therefore formally
     agreed as the reference starting point for the concessionaire.


Exclusivity

Situations where an exclusivity clause may be warranted

Although competition-restricting provisions are generally not advisable, there are
situations where some kind of limited exclusivity may be considered:

   When existing container traffic at the time of concessioning is only marginally
    sufficient to make a balanced operation possible for a private operator. Typi-
    cally, if fully privately financed, even a small scale terminal, two berths for in-
    stance, three/four gantry cranes and corresponding yard equipment, will need
    around 100,000 TEUs per year to break even under an average container han-
    dling tariff. As long as the traffic remains in this vicinity or slightly above, al-
    lowing for the possibility of a competitor, a shipping line for instance, to set up
    its own terminal to handle its own traffic could undermine practically overnight
    the financial sustainability of the concession.

   When the investment required from the concessionaire is well above what
    would be necessary to handle existing traffic under normal circumstances,
    which is the case for instance if the concessionaire has to invest in an infrastruc-
    ture with a high threshold effect, like an island terminal that cannot easily be
    developed in stages. Clearly, in such a situation, the port authority could avoid
    the exclusivity issue if it could afford financing the share of the investment over
    and above the level necessary to cater to existing traffic.


Traffic-bound and time-bound exclusivity

In all cases, however, the exclusivity provision must not be open-ended. It must be
either time-bound or traffic-bound, and can be expressed in a formula using the
following wording: no new port infrastructure for handling containers will be devel-
oped that competes with the terminal operated by the Concessionaire within xx km of
the Port for x years or as long as the traffic does not reach xxx,000 TEUs per year, which-
ever comes first. Five years will often be a reasonable period, and it provide the con-
cessionaire with some incentive to keep improving the quality/cost ratio of its ser-
vices to deter its customers from moving to a potential competitor in case the traffic
level remains below the other exclusivity limit.

Performance parameters

Schedule of key performance indicators
Key performance indicators may include:

   SHIP PRODUCTIVITY: number of container moves per ship hour at berth. This is the
    best indicator of the terminal’s commercial performance for shipping lines. A
    minimum benchmark for gearless full containerships today would be 60 moves
    per hour at berth. This objective will be adjusted downward for smaller size
    vessels, non-cellular vessels and feeder vessels, which cannot be worked on with
    several gantry cranes simultaneously.

   SHIP CALL PRODUCTIVITY: number of container moves per ship hour in port. This
    is the ultimate port performance indicator for the shipping lines, but obviously
    it includes aspects outside of the control of the terminal operator, like towage
    and vessel movements governed by the Harbor Master’s Office. So it should not
    be part of the concession indicators, but the port authority should monitor it
    nonetheless, since any large disconnect between ship productivity and ship call
    productivity would be a clue that marine services are likely below standard, bar-
    ring disrupting weather events.

   CRANE PRODUCTIVITY: number of container moves per gross working hours (gross
    productivity) or per net working hours (net productivity, deducting all non-opera-
    tional and idle time experienced by each crane). The difference between gross and
    net productivity can be an indication of a ship difficult to work (non-optimal
    bay plans, physical characteristics) or of operational inefficiencies on the ter-
    minal. Similarly, a high disconnect between gross crane productivity times the
    number of cranes working a ship, and ship productivity would likely be an in-
    dicator of sub-optimal call management by the terminal, or of unpredictable
    disrupting events (e.g. weather).

   QUAY PRODUCTIVITY: number of container moves per meter of quay per year. This
    is a utilization indicator the port authority must monitor to assess the capacity
    utilization of the sea side of the terminal.

   TERMINAL PRODUCTIVITY: number of containers handled per hectare or square
    meter of container yard per year. This is a utilization indicator the port authority
    must monitor to assess the capacity utilization of the land side of the terminal.
    It obviously varies with the type of operational equipment in use, as well as with
    the containers dwell time, over which the operator has little control.




                                                                                     35
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




   DWELL TIME: It measures the period from the time a container is lifted off the ship
    to the time it departs the container yard for imports, and the reverse for exports. It
    is a critical indicator of the efficient use of the terminal area, but it may depend
    on other actors than the terminal operator, notably customs, and sometimes
    importers’ commercial practices. But it must be carefully monitored so that
    corrective measures or policy incentives can be deployed in case of excessive
    dwell time in the terminal area. Two days for exports and seven days for imports
    should be considered a maximum acceptable level in most cases.

   TRUCK TURNAROUND TIME: It measures the time from entry to exit in the terminal
    area when delivering or picking up a box. Twenty minutes is the common effi-
    ciency benchmark for efficient operations.


Remedies for insufficient performance

Performance must be assessed on a monthly basis, but bearing in mind possible
variations between calls characteristics, contractual performance should be formally
evaluated annually. If the annual average performance is below target, a financial
penalty can be assessed.

To be both fair and effective in providing the right incentive, a penalty should only
apply to an objective which is fully under the control of the operator and which best
illustrates the overall operational performance of the terminal. Ship productivity
meets those two criteria.

The penalty formula could then apply the missing percentage of the performance
target to total traffic times the royalty fee. Example:

   Ship productivity contractual objective: 60 moves per ship hour at berth.
   Annual ship productivity achieved: 54 moves per ship hour at berth.
   Missing productivity percentage: 10%
   Total traffic handled at the terminal that year: 200,000 TEUs
   Royalty per TEU: US$5
      Penalty: 0.10 x 200,000 x 5 = US$100,000

To account for the adjustment period when the concessionaire takes over the facil-
ity, no penalty shall be payable for not meeting the performance target in the first
year of operation.




36
                                                                The Concession Contract




However, if the concessionaire comes short of the performance target by 20% or
more for three consecutive years of operation or in any three years out of a consec-
utive five years of operation period, then the port authority may elect, in its sole
discretion, to declare this a contractual event of default, and the corresponding pro-
vision must then be included in the concession contract.


Investments

Investments requirements should to the largest possible extent be linked to capacity
utilization and operational performance—only when there is an obvious need, re-
construction or hazard to operate, should they be made contractual and time-
bound, as also for safety and security purposes (lighting, fences, etc.). Under normal
circumstances, making a pre-determined and time-bound investment schedule
contractual carries at least three risks: (i) that investments are made too much ahead
of time if demand does not follow forecasts, which carries a cost that will one way
or another be charged back to the port authority, (ii) that investments are made
despite sub-optimal productivity of existing assets, which removes much incentive
to maximize utilization of existing infrastructure, and (iii) that the concessionaire
prefers to litigate rather than comply, arguing for instance that an unexpected eco-
nomic depression made all forecasts irrelevant. The best formula is to include ob-
jective triggers in the concession contract, like reaching 80% of optimal capacity two
years in a row, or reaching maximum average acceptable waiting times six months
in a row (occupation ratios are not so much relevant anymore with window-berth-
ing schemes), to launch investments operations.


Concession fee

The concession fee may or may not include an initial down payment, followed by a
series of annual payments typically representing both the cost of leasing the conces-
sion area and the fee for the right to operate the terminal.

Down payment

The down payment may be justified to cover the necessary adjustments costs the
port authority may have to incur to make the concession possible, for instance (i)
the social costs of right-sizing the workforce through early retirement, voluntary
departures and retraining programs, or (ii) infrastructure investments required to
improve accessibility, like dredging or dedicated land access routes. As discussed




                                                                                    37
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




earlier, it can either be determined by the port authority as an input into the bidding
documents, or left for the bidder to propose as one of the selection criteria. Over
time, down payments have become the norm, as illustrated in table 6 (Berbera is a
specific case, due to the political and commercial risk, as the main potential is to
attract Ethiopia transit once the connecting infrastructure is built).

           2016            Berbera                        10



Annual payments

The annual payments cover the price for leasing the concession area, which remains
under the ownership of the port authority, as well as the fee for the right to operate
the terminal. The lease value can be determined by the port authority either based
on the land market for a greenfield project, or on the amount invested in the assets
of the terminal when concessioning out an existing facility. If the port authority de-
veloped the facility with debt financing, the lease must at the minimum cover the
cost of debt amortization payments. These bases for calculating the lease provide
the ground for establishing a floor level for the annual concession payment, even
when the total annual fee is left for the bidder to propose. The amount of the annual
concession fee over and above the lease value reflects the price to be paid for the
right to operate the terminal.

Escalation clause

The concession fee is usually expressed in dollar, euro, or other hard currency. Since
the term of the concession might reach 25 or 30 years, costs inflation must clearly
be considered. A contract should therefore include a specific clause on indexation.

An option would be to adjust the fee periodically on the basis of a basket of curren-
cies, such as a combination of the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the currency in which
the concession fee is expressed. The national Consumer Price Index can also be used
as a reference to the extent the local economy is open enough so that the CPI reflects
the variations in costs of both internal and external inputs.

It is advisable to adjust the concession fee at regular intervals, probably aligned with
tariff adjustments, then avoiding leaving the commercial terms unchanged for too
long a period, which may lead to financial distortions detrimental to the sound
management of the concession. A three-year period looks like a reasonable maxi-
mum interval between revisions.


Royalty fee

Profit sharing principles

The royalty fee schedule is an opportunity to set up a mechanism whereby the fi-
nancial benefits of the growth of traffic, achieved thanks in part to the performance
of the operator but also to the management of the port authority, are shared between
the partners to the concession contract. It illustrates one shared objective of both
the port authority and the concessionaire, which is to grow the traffic, even if it may
be for different ultimate goals, economic growth for the port, and financial return
for the operator.

Royalty sliding scale

There are actually two ways to build this profit-sharing mechanism:

   If the main objective of the port authority in concessioning out the terminal is
    to maximize revenues, the royal fee schedule can be designed with an upward
    staggered structure, whereby the amount per TEU increases with traffic (Abid-
    jan TC1 for instance).

   If the objective of the port authority is to boost traffic, as part of a policy to
    promote the port as a transshipment hub, the royalty fee schedule can be de-
    signed with a downward staggered structure, whereby the amount per TEU de-
    creases as traffic grows. This provides an additional incentive to the operator to
    increase the traffic, as his profit per container will grow with the traffic.




                                                                                      39
     Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




     In both cases, to avoid too brisk a change up or down in revenues of the port au-
     thority, it is advisable to apply the royalty schedule by tranches, and not to the total
     traffic as one threshold is reached.

     Moreover, the royalty fee may be defined at different levels for different traffic flows,
     domestic and transshipment for instance.


     Tariff and regulation principles

     These Guidelines consider how tariffs for commercial services charged by a conces-
     sionaire for handling containers going through the terminal it operates should be
     regulated. There are, however, other financial flows taking place between economic
     actors around a container terminal that cannot easily be apprehended, including
     charging arrangements between shipping lines, consignees, freight forwarders,
     which ultimately have a bearing on the total transit cost through the terminal, but
     do not typically fall under the purview of a public regulatory regime, unless partic-
     ular circumstances apply. The structure of port costs is inherently complex, and port
     authorities should keep monitoring the total spectrum of charges being levied on
     the cargo as it moves through the port, so that they have an updated picture of the
     whole process at all times and can assess its competitiveness accordingly.

Keeping in mind that the economic regulation of tariffs is fundamentally a proxy
for insufficient competition, tariff regulation may vary depending on the level of
competition the operator faces for different categories of traffic 5.

Captive traffic

In most cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, domestic traffic will be deemed captive for
want of alternative ways to bring it in or out of the country. This is the consequence,
on one hand, of the limited number of possible ports of entry in individual countries
(sometimes only one), and on the other hand, of the lack of trade and transport
facilitation across land borders with neighboring countries, which prevent the es-
tablishment of additional cross-regional supply chains. The terminal operator
therefore enjoys a natural monopoly on captive traffic, which justifies economic
regulation of its tariff by the port authority. This regulation is embedded in the con-
cession contract, which stipulates the maximum tariff the operator is allowed to ap-
ply.

To ensure the financial integrity of the concession, this tariff cap should not be be-
low the costs incurred by the operator in providing the service, plus a reasonable
profit margin. The cap is meant to prevent him from overcharging by taking ad-
vantage of the lack of competition, not to deny him a fair profit. This is why the
concession contract can sometimes also include a provision to monitor the financial
rate of return allowed on the investments by the operator, and to provide for ad-
justments of the concession fee or of the tariff cap in case the financial balance of
the concession is at risk of being undermined (as in Abidjan TC2 for instance).

Competitive traffic (including transshipment)

When there is natural competition, as in the case of transshipment traffic, there is
no ground for economic regulation of tariff, and the operator should be free to set
up his tariff schedule. This will be acted in the concession contract.

There could be instances where public authorities wish to impose tariff caps on
some specific commodities, whether or not they are subject to competition for port
services. This is typically the case for basic supplies or specific export cargoes (cotton
in Dakar for instance), but these provisions are policy instruments that use port

    Regulator in South Africa www.portsregulator.org/economic/tariff-methodology.

tariffs to further their goals, and should not be construed as economic regulation of
port tariff. Should these imposed tariff caps be blatantly below the cost of providing
the service, they could even justify compensation payments as consequence of pub-
lic service obligations, as in other transport sectors (public transport for instance).
However, an easier way to gauge their impact on the financial balance of the con-
cession would be to monitor the rate of return on investments as discussed above,
and adjust other financial terms of the contract accordingly.


Clause on non-discrimination and common user principle

Terminal operating companies

The concessionaire shall endeavor to serve all customers without preference or dis-
crimination, be it on price or quality of service, irrespective of any link of any kind
it may have, corporate or otherwise, with any particular customer. Discrimination
complaints, if established, could lead to remedies that could, if repeated, result in
the port authority rescinding the concession contract due to event of default by the
concessionaire.

The formal customer feedback loop described below will be instrumental in docu-
menting complaints.

Special case of the shipping lines

When a shipping line is awarded a concession to operate a container terminal, most
often it is to exclusively handle its own traffic. However, when the terminal to be
operated is a common user facility, special care must be exercised by the port au-
thority to assuage concerns that all customers may not be treated equally. The non-
discrimination clause mentioned above shall be strengthened to explicitly state that
the operator’s ships shall not benefit from any preferred operational treatment. Dis-
crimination complaints will be handled as indicated above.


Information requirements

The purpose of the port authority in collecting this information is to ensure, in par-
ticular when it is dealing with a monopoly situation but the rationale stands in all
cases, that the piece of waterfront concessioned to the private operator is exploited
with optimal efficiency. As the ultimate owner of a scarce resource like coastal land,

                                                                 The Concession Contract




and as trustee of the public interest, the port authority has a duty to monitor the use
being made of this resource and be satisfied that it is optimally exploited for the
good of the national economy.

Operational information

The concession contract must spell out the operational information the concession-
aire is expected to provide the port authority with at regular intervals. Beyond the
data necessary to assess the level of performance achieved as per the contractual ob-
jectives, a monthly operational report will be prepared by the concessionaire docu-
menting the following:

     Monthly analysis of container throughput by shipping line
     Average ship productivity by shipping line
     Average crane gross and net productivity
     Average container dwell time import and export
     Average truck turnaround time
     Equipment availability rates
     Equipment utilization rates
     Information on industrial accidents, if any
     Information on industrial disputes, if any


Financial information

The concessionaire shall submit to the port authority, within six months after the
end of each financial year, a report of its financial operations pertaining to the ter-
minal, together with its audited accounts, including balance sheet, operating ac-
count, profit and losses account, cash flow, and any relevant notes and annexes, as
well as the auditors’ report.


Review clause

In some particular circumstances (e.g. volatile market demand, uncertain invest-
ment needs sharing with host government or port authority, currency devaluation)
it might make sense to build within a concession contract a review clause that allows
both public and private sector to discuss possible amendment to the concession
framework either at fixed intervals (e.g. every five years) or whenever one or several
economic condition changes already identified in the initial concession contract




                                                                                     43
Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




have occurred. This approach can assist in adjusting the concession contract frame-
work in a transparent and predictable manner. In frontier markets such as those of
Sub-Saharan Africa, this approach, if sensibly designed and negotiated (i.e. it does
not only provide upside to the public party), could actual result in lowering the risk
perception of private investors and their commercial lenders.


Extension of the concession

A contractual option to extend the concession at the end of the initial concession
period provides a natural incentive for the concessionaire to keep up his perfor-
mance and maintenance efforts as the contract nears its term, but the conditions
under which it can be requested by the operator and granted by the port authority
must be explicitly spelled out in the initial concession contract to ensure a transpar-
ent negotiation. In particular, it must make clear that the ultimate decision whether
or not to extend the concession remains fully with the port authority, without hav-
ing to justify its decision in case of refusal.

In the case of long-term concessions (20 to 30 years), it is good practice to start the
formal extension discussions two years before the end of the contract, and to reach
a decision at least one year before the expiry of the initial concession.


Expiration of the concession

If the concession is not extended, the contract must define how the assets of the
concession are to be transferred to the port authority, and in particular specify the
compensation to be paid to the concessionaire for the assets not fully depreciated.
A fair compensation mechanism is critical to protect against the potential tempta-
tion for the concessionaire to cut back on maintenance during the last two years of
the contract.

For the assets that had been transferred to the concessionaire at the outset of the
contract, and have to be returned to the port authority, like gantry cranes and heavy
yard equipment, the contract must provide for a joint inspection procedure to de-
termine whether the assets are in full working order at the time of transfer. Should
any action be taken to restore the full capacity of any asset to be returned, it must
be at the expense of the concessionaire.

Dispute resolution

Arbitration
If a conflict between the parties cannot be solved by amicable settlement, the con-
cession contract may provide an arbitration procedure. A decision has to be made
as to the Court of Arbitration. Typically, port authorities prefer a local court, often
housed in the national Chamber of Commerce and Industry or equivalent institu-
tion, while international lenders, when they are involved in financing or supporting
the concession agreement, may prefer an international court like the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the London Court of International Arbitration
(LCIA). It is worthwhile noting that the LCIA has set up local or affiliated branches
in several countries, namely in the United Arab Emirates (DFIC-LCIA in Dubai), in
Mauritius (LCIA-MIAC), in India and in Singapore. The International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), part of the World Bank Group, may
also provide a venue (as was the case after the cancellation of the concession for the
Conakry Container Terminal in Guinea).

Court proceedings

In the case that one of the parties refuses the arbitration protocol, the ultimate venue
to settle a contractual conflict will be the court of justice of the country hosting the
concession.

Lenders’ rights

When the concession project involves commercial lenders to finance planned capi-
tal expenditures, these lenders will always want to make sure that they have a series
of rights to protect their interests. Among the most prominent is their right linked
to an event of an early termination of the concession agreement. In this case most
multilateral lenders such as Proparco (private arm of the French development
agency, Agence Française de Dévelopement), IFC (private arm of the World Bank
Group), etc., because of their articles of incorporation that forbids them to lend to
a public entity must require that the conceding authority liquidates any outstanding
debt at the time of termination, including pays for any early debt liquidation penal-
ties embedded in their commercial loans. Likewise, lenders will want to make sure
that they have preemption rights to any liquidated damages and other payments
made to the concessionaire by the conceding authority in similar case of early ter-
mination. Likewise, Lenders will usually ask the conceding authority to grant them
up to a year to find and seek a replacement to the operator, or restructure of the

shareholding of the operator, if the conceding authority decides to trigger a default
clause against the operator that would lead to the early termination of the conces-
sion agreement for cause. Lastly, the lenders may require some oversight rights or
approval rights regarding the tariff setting mechanisms (specifically when this leads
to the lowering of maximum applicable tariffs or the re basing of tariffs in local cur-
rency using a decision making process that was not identified in the concession con-
tract at the time of its signature) and/or level of indebtness that the concession can
accrue.

4. The Management and Control of the Concession



Access requirements of the port authority

On-site access

The port authority must have at all time full access to the terminal, without of course
disrupting the operations. It will in particular carry out regular technical visits to
control the maintenance activities on the terminal infrastructure, as defined in the
concession agreement.

Access to information
The concession agreement will specify the information to be made available to the
port authority on a regular fashion (see section on Information requirements). The
monthly operational reports should be made available to the general public by being
disclosed on the website of the port authority or the operator (Example: Meridian
Port Services, the operator of the Tema container terminal, publishes on line de-
tailed monthly operational reports 6). The annual financial reports will be shared
with the port community council when it exists.

Port community systems (PCS) also provide an opportunity to widely share opera-
tional information among all port and shipping stakeholders. As defined by the In-
ternational Port Community Systems Association (IPCSA), “A PCS is a modular
system with functionality designed to provide all the various sectors and players within
a port community environment with tools specific to them, thus delivering a tightly in-
tegrated system. Developed for port users by port users, a PCS encompasses exports, im-
ports, transshipments, consolidations, hazardous cargo and maritime statistics report-
ing”. Operational terminal statistics can therefore find their way on a PCS website.
Similarly, single windows could also provide access to the same kind of operational
information to their participants.

Container Terminals Concession Guidelines




On particular occasions, the port authority may need access to additional opera-
tional and financial information and data, as when discussing with the concession-
aire the opportunity to increase handling charges. This information must be made
available with the caveat that it may not be disclosed to third parties as some of it
may pertain to the proprietary arrangements of the operator.

As a rule, in monopoly or quasi-monopoly situations like the ones prevailing in
many Sub-Saharan African countries for container terminals operations, as far as
domestic traffic is concerned, the port authority must require full financial trans-
parency from the terminal operating company, so that it can satisfy itself through-
out the term of the concession that the legitimate profit margin of the concession-
aire remain within reasonable bounds.

In particular, when applying to the port authority for an increase in the maximum
handling charge allowed for domestic traffic, the concessionaire shall provide doc-
umented evidence of the raise of its own operating costs that justify the request on
the basis of maintaining his profit margin at an acceptable level for both contractual
partners. Available cost accounting results shall be made available to the port au-
thority to support the operator’s claims.

Beyond the monthly performance reports, a more comprehensive performance re-
view will also be warranted when discussing tariff increases, so that the port author-
ity can assess the overall degree of efficiency displayed by the concessionaire in ex-
ploiting all the assets at his disposal. Should potential improvement possibilities be
identified during such a review, the port authority may then postpone its decision
on increasing tariffs until the time when the identified improvements materialize.
An updated cost accounting review will be carried out at this point to establish
whether the request can actually be supported.

Performance monitoring

Ongoing assessment of key performance indicators

The operations directorate of the port authority will monitor the performance of
the terminal on an ongoing basis by reviewing the monthly operational reports sub-
mitted by the operator. It will also confirm them with the shipping lines represent-
atives, for instance during the regular meetings of the port community council or of
any equivalent consultative body representing the port and the shipping profes-
sional community. Any contradictory information tabled during these consulta-
tions will then be submitted back to the operator for clarification or correction.

Periodicity and format of reviews

On top of the monthly reports required by the concession agreement, and upon
which penalties may be assessed annually in case of insufficient performance (see
section on Performance parameters), the port authority may want to carry out quar-
terly performance reviews to fully document the workings of the facility.

These quarterly reviews will focus on the overall operational organization of the ter-
minal, including access protocols, security arrangements and ISPS (International
Ship and Port Facility Security code) implementation, safety procedures, data man-
agement, customer service, dispute resolution, equipment and infrastructure
maintenance, interface with customs and review of customers’ feedback.

Like the monthly operational reports, the quarterly reviews will be posted on the
website of the port authority and made accessible by the general public.

Customer feedback

Formalization of a customer feedback loop
Mobilizing port customers is a very powerful way to both ascertain the true level of
performance of the operator and keep him focused on delivering the best results. To
this end, customer feedback must be formalized, since absent this provision, it re-
mains difficult to act on it. A conduit to channel feedback could be the port com-
munity council if this kind of structure exists.

Establishing a port community council goes beyond the realm of these Guidelines,
but it is worthwhile to stress the usefulness and importance of such a venue to dis-
cuss critical aspects of port management and performance and, above all, to set up
and nurture a constructive relationship between the port authority and all its con-
stituents (see section on Role of the port community council). As part of the prepara-
tory steps towards a terminal concession project, setting up a port community coun-
cil, if not yet in place, is another positive means to foster a spirit of transparency and
shared purpose among the port community at large. Furthermore, when such coun-
cils do exist but with just an advisory function, it would be highly advisable to get
them moved from a mere consultative role to the status of an official forum where
issues raised should get answers within a definite period of time.

If a concession is awarded without an existing port community council, a formal
customer feedback channel must be provided, on the port website for instance
where professionals would have a specific access-protected protocol to submit their
assessments. The concession agreement must also refer to this feedback and define
how the port authority may use it. (Examples: The Mombasa Port Community to-
gether with the Northern Corridor Transport Observatory publishes a Performance
Dashboard Report summing up productivity and efficiency results across the corri-
dor, starting in the port of Mombasa http://top.ttcanc.org/).

Process to handle customer feedback

Whether collected through the port community council or directly from port cus-
tomers through the website of the port authority, the feedback must be processed,
i.e. submitted for answer or comments to the relevant directorate of the port au-
thority and/or to the concessionaire, and the answers sent to the customers using
the same channel. To instill some discipline into the process, a maximum time win-
dow must be enforced for the answers to be provided, for instance two weeks for




                                                                                       51

issues related to simple daily working practices, up to two months for issues requir-
ing a specific investigation. All questions and answers will be posted on the website
of the port authority and made available to the general public.

For issues of particular sensitivity, like discrimination claims, a very thorough pro-
cess is required. Practical monitoring of common user requirements can most ef-
fectively be done by setting up a formal feedback mechanism allowing users who
believe they have been discriminated against to voice their claims. Those claims and
the results of their review by the port authority should then be made public, for
instance on its website. The concession contract will establish this formal mecha-
nism, which must be made public if the contract itself is not, and will state that over
a certain number of legitimate claims in a given year, three for instance, the conces-
sion could be terminated at the concessionaire’s fault. Simultaneously, to avoid
abuse by the claimants, any claimant found to have brought forward two illegitimate
claims would be subject to financial penalties by the port authority.

Role of the port community council

The port community council has a critical role to play in improving the transpar-
ency of port operations, for the benefit of all users and final customers of port ser-
vices, including shippers. It must be a formal instance, with an explicit mandate and

working arrangements. It will hold regular meetings, typically on a monthly basis,
and barring any special circumstances, its deliberations will be made public (Exam-
ple: Mauritius below).

Box 5: Mauritius Ports Authority (MPA) Port Users Council


 The Port Users Council in collaboration with the MPA is:
   - actively interacting with port users for efficient port operations;
   - undertaking market studies to identify potential new port users and their requirements;
   - promoting the facilities, services and future potential of Port Louis in close co-operation with
      the operators of port services and the Mauritius Freeport Authority; and
   - responding positively to third parties expressing interest in the development of port or port-
      related activities.
 The Council which has a consultative status deliberates extensively on important matters like port
 development projects, tariffs revision, changes in legislation and procedures, etc.

 Terms of Reference
   - to provide a regular medium of communication between port authorities and related agen-
     cies on the one hand, and all port users on the other;
   - to discuss matters affecting clients’ interests in general, level and adequacy of port services
     and port performance;
   - to examine and discuss the port situation and port efficiency;
   - to advise on port regulations, procedures and practices, documentation systems and other
     related matters;
   - to discuss port development projects and advise on adequacy of port facilities;
   - to make suggestions on security, safety and environment projects likely to affect the effi-
     ciency of the port;
   - to assist the port in its marketing strategy and the enhancement of its image;
   - to suggest and propose improvements in areas of common interest to the port users; and
     to discuss any other related issues.




Most existing port community councils are consultative entities, which are obvi-
ously valuable as a conduit between port authorities and their professional environ-
ment, but this status could be enhanced by making them an official channel to table
questions from port customers about, for instance, the implementation and super-
vision of a container terminal concession. To make it an effective process, this chan-
nel must be part of a customer feedback loop defined as such in the port institutional
and contractual arrangements. The issues transmitted to the council would be for-
mally submitted to the port authority, which will have, as suggested above, maxi-
mum periods of time to reply, depending on the complexity of the question. Im-
portantly, both the questions and answers will be posted on the website of the port




                                                                                                   53

community council or on the one of the port authority, so that all port stakeholders
will receive an even and complete information.


Annual operational reviews

During the final quarter of the fiscal year, the port authority will carry out an annual
operational review of the concession that will be featured in the port authority’s
annual report. This review will build on the previous quarterly reviews and provide
an overall assessment of the performance and service quality offered on the terminal
throughout the year. If warranted, it will also suggest possible adjustments to im-
prove overall performance and customers’ relations.


Public information disclosure

As a rule, apart from situations where proprietary information belonging to the con-
cessionaire must remain confidential, all monitoring reports on the performance of
the concession should be made public and posted on the website of the port author-
ity. Financial reports will be shared with the port community council when it exists,
and the audited reports can also be made public.


Adaptation of contract provisions

During the life of a 25- or 30-year concession, circumstances may change in ways
that could not be anticipated at the time when the original contract was negotiated.
It is therefore possible that at some point in time some provisions of the contract
may have to be adjusted. But while this is acceptable in principle, it must be very
strictly circumscribed to situations which undeniably warrant reconsideration of
previously agreed arrangements. It should not, in particular, occur within a short
time frame following the signing of the original agreement, at the risk of undermin-
ing the validity and seriousness of the original bidding process. The concession
agreement may actually specify a timeframe within which adjustment of any con-
tract provision is prohibited, barring force majeure events.

Box 6: Dar Es Salaam concession adjustments

 The container terminal in Dar Es Salaam port is concessioned. The original concessionaire was a
 consortium consisting of International Container Terminal Inc in the Philippines (ICTSI) with 70%
 of shares and Vertex Financial services of Tanzania with 30%. The consortium registered a local
 company Tanzania International Container Terminals Services Ltd (TICTS), which began opera-
 tions in September 2000 with a ten-year contract. Subsequently, Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH)
 of Hong Kong purchased a proportion of worldwide interests of ICTSI, so that 70% of the shares
 in the concession are now held by HPH.
 The initial concession was for 10 years, without the possibility of extension but with a review after
 5 years in the event of greater-than-expected traffic volumes. The contract did not offer exclusiv-
 ity to the concession for container handling.
 The contract was renegotiated in the fifth year of the concession, in 2005, when traffic was in-
 creasing strongly and the terminal productivity was at its highest. An extended contract was
 signed for an additional 15 years, giving 25 years in total. The extended contract differed in con-
 cept from the original contract, which was envisaged as primarily an operating contract, with min-
 imal investment obligations. The extended contract requires the concessionaire to make substan-
 tial investments. In addition it contains some important operating changes, with the provision of
 additional berth space and an extended back-up area. A clause was included giving exclusivity for
 the handling of container vessels to the concessionaire, to apply until a level of 650,000 TEUs had
 been reached.

Should the concessionaire believe a contract adjustment has become warranted ow-
ing to unforeseeable and significant change in the economic environment within
which he has to operate, it falls on him to prepare a documented request for contract
adjustment and submit it to the port authority. It must be stressed, however, that
the port authority has all latitude on whether to consider the request or deny it,
based on its own assessment of the local conditions (see Box 6 above).

5. Conclusion



The objective of the guidelines is to help public authorities steer their way as effi-
ciently as possible towards successful negotiation and implementation of container
terminal concessions. However, it will always be for them alone to do the heavy lift-
ing that such an endeavor entails.

All said and done, it remains paramount for decision-making authorities, govern-
ments and port authorities, not to lose sight of the goals they set for themselves when
embarking on the concessioning journey, for it remains often too easy to get di-
verted towards secondary short-term objectives. Let’s keep in mind the kind of con-
tractual relationship a concession agreement involves is far more complex than the
regular owner/contractor relationship public authorities have been used to so far—
and so more complex is the procurement and negotiation process as well.

Because of this complexity, and of the initial asymmetry of experience between the
public concessioning authority and the private terminal operator, it is absolutely
essential that public authorities be equipped with all required skills, legal in partic-
ular, to enable them to negotiate on a level playing field with their private counter-
parts. This is the reason why multilateral development banks usually stand ready to
provide, or finance, technical assistance to concessioning authorities when they de-
cide to launch a container terminal concession. As an example, the private sector
arm of the World Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation, is offering
transaction advisory and management services to client countries to help them cope
effectively with these situations.
