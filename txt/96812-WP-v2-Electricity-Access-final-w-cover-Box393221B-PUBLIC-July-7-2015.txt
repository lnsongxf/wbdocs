This report was written in conjunction with IEG’s evaluation of the World Bank
Group’s electricity access activities as a complementary review of partnership
programs active in energy access. Some of the main findings of this review are
integrated in the electricity access evaluation. It follows a modified format for global
program reviews. Anna Aghumian and Rasmus Heltberg were the task team
leaders. Andres Liebenthal and Anna Amato completed the team which was
supported by Yasmin Angeles. Fernando Manibog was the peer reviewer. The team
is grateful to the many people listed in appendix C who agreed to be interviewed for
this study.

        Introduction, Purpose, and Methodology
Sustainable Energy for All—A Compelling but Challenging Goal
There is a broad international consensus for the goal of providing universal access to
modern energy services. This goal has been strongly endorsed by the leadership of
the UN and the World Bank and declared in the ‘Sustainable Energy for All’
(SE4ALL) initiative co-chaired by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and World
Bank President Jim Kim.

The World Bank Group’s latest energy sector strategy mirrors the SE4All goals of
achieving universal access, accelerating improvements in energy efficiency, and
doubling the global share of renewable energy by 2030. It announces specific
commitments to help meet the SE4All goals. As expressed in the World Bank
Group’s 2013 energy strategy paper, “supporting universal access to reliable modern
energy is a priority. Economic growth, which is essential for poverty reduction, is
not possible without adequate energy. And economic growth cannot be said to be
building shared prosperity as long as 1.2 billion people are without access to
electricity and 2.8 billion are without modern cooking facilities. Lack of energy limits
opportunity, job creation, business development, and access to health and
education.”1

The pursuit of universal energy access faces major challenges related to cost,
affordability, technology, and the need for cross-sectoral solutions. Energy is
expensive, and the cost of supply often exceeds the ability and willingness to pay of
low-income families. A 2008 IEG evaluation of rural electrification found that it is
difficult to generalize about the potential welfare impacts, as they are highly context
specific.2 Energy costs are especially prohibitive in rural areas, where low density of
demand raises costs and reduces profitability for prospective energy suppliers.
Energy access issues often require coordination with the development of
complementary sectors: credit programs may be needed to facilitate uptake by
poorer households; business development services may be required to help small
businesses take advantage of electrification; and health campaigns may be needed to
raise awareness about the (very detrimental) health impacts of indoor air pollution
and stimulate the demand for improved cookstoves.3

INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, AND METHODOLOGY

Partnership Programs Have Long Contributed to Energy Access
The Bank has a long record of supporting electricity access through projects and
partnership programs such as the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) which has been a major supporter of learning, policy advice, technical
assistance (TA), and knowledge management on access issues since its inception in
1983.

In support of the UN-World Bank Group commitment to universal energy access—
and in order to complement IEG’s sector evaluation of the Bank Group’s work in
energy access—IEG has undertaken a review of a cluster of four partnership
programs that support energy access activities. It aimed to assess to what extent
these partnership programs have contributed to the objective of universal access to
modern energy services. It also assessed the extent to which this objective has been
pursued in a gender sensitive manner, in line with the World Bank Group’s
commitment to empower women in the energy sector.

The review focused on the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Lighting Africa, and the
Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE). These four programs
were selected because they are the largest and most prominent World Bank Group-
supported partnership programs engaged with energy access (they also engage in
other areas but this review focuses on their energy access activities). Their combined
expenditures were almost $270 million during the 2007–13 period, of which IEG
estimates that about $132 million was for energy access (Table 1.1). More than 50
percent of these comprise GPOBA’s subsidy projects. On average, the four programs
have initiated about 16 energy access activities per year during this period (Figure
1.1).

All four programs promote energy access with technical assistance and knowledge
activities. These constitute the entirety of Lighting Africa’s and the major part of
ESMAP and ASTAE’s energy access portfolios. ESMAP and, especially, ASTAE, also
support preparation and implementation of World Bank energy access projects.
GPOBA’s main thrust lies in targeted subsidies for energy access. (Figure 1.2).

GPOBA was established as a partnership program in 2003 to fund, design,
demonstrate, and document output-based aid (OBA) approaches to improve
delivery of basic services to the poor in developing countries. As of June 30, 2013,
the GPOBA had funded a diverse portfolio of 36 projects, with total commitments of
$161.3 million. Energy access accounted for 12 (33 percent) of these projects and for
$68.1 million (42 percent) of total funding. In addition, GPOBA has supported
knowledge and learning program to extract, analyze, and share lessons from the
design and implementation of OBA approaches.

ESMAP was established in 1983 as a global, multi-donor technical assistance trust
fund administered by the World Bank. Its mission is to assist low- and middle-
income countries to increase their know-how and capacity to achieve
environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic
growth. Given this mission, ESMAP has focused on analytical and advisory services,
which include technical assistance, economic and sector work, capacity building,
and knowledge generation. The program covers a wide range of energy issues,
including energy access starting in the early 1990s. Based on its 2013 portfolio

review, energy access accounted for 39 (21 percent) of ESMAP’s completed activities
and $12.3 million (26 percent) of total budget allocations during the FY2009–2012
period. Fourteen (36 percent) of these activities informed policies and strategies, 3 (8
percent) increased knowledge, 4 (10 percent) generated innovative approaches and
solutions, 11 (28 percent) informed development financing, and 7 (18 percent)
increased client capacity.

Lighting Africa, a joint program of the World Bank and IFC, was launched in 2007
with the aim of improving access to clean, affordable lighting in Africa. Its goal is to
help catalyze markets for quality, affordable, clean, and safe off-grid lighting, and
ultimately to create a sustainable commercial platform that will realize the vision of
providing 250 million people with modern off-grid lighting by 2030. The overall
approach is to demonstrate the viability of the market by providing market
intelligence, improve the enabling environment by developing a quality assurance
infrastructure, facilitate business to business interactions, help governments address
policy barriers, provide business development services, and facilitate access to
finance for manufacturers, local distributors and other stakeholders. Donors have
contributed about $22 million to Lighting Africa in 2007-2013. The Global
Environment Facility was the largest donor providing more than one third of the
funds. As of June 2013 Lighting Africa had disbursed $16 million, of which $5.1
million (about 30 percent) was allocated to knowledge products and dissemination.

The Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE) was created in 1992
with the mandate to scale up the use of sustainable energy options in Asia. In 2002
the program scaled up and broadened its objective by adding a third pillar—access
to modern energy services—designed to address energy poverty and its impact on
the environment. ASTAE has supported World Bank energy access operations by:
supporting innovative investment delivery mechanisms, enhancing policy and
regulatory frameworks, building capacity, and sharing knowledge. During 2007-13
ASTAE funded 34 energy access activities in the amount of $6.5 million ranging
from project preparation work to knowledge generation and dissemination.


How Do These Partnership Programs Compare?
Each of these four programs has different scope, coverage and approach to
improving access to energy by promoting a range of technological and market
solutions (Table 1.3).

 GPOBA and ESMAP—the two largest programs—are global in scope. ESMAP’s
objective is broad and its upstream knowledge work, which is the program’s main
contribution, covers policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional aspects as well as
technologies to expand access to energy. GPOBA’s subsidy projects fund energy
access regardless of the applied technology. Ensuring that the poor get access to
basic services is key for GPOBA and to achieve that the programs applies a specific
output-based aid model that is built on the provision of targeted subsidies.

Both ASTAE and Lighting Africa are regional in scope, focusing on the regions with
the lowest access to electricity rates in the world—Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
respectively. Lighting Africa pilots market solution to improving access to energy in
Sub-Saharan Africa. The program’s objective is narrowly defined. It promotes one
type of off-grid technology: basic solar lanterns (PicoPV) predominantly for lighting
in households in selected Sub-Saharan countries. ASTAE’s original focus was on
renewable energy. However the program covers all spectrum of technologies — grid
and off-grid, including photovoltaic systems, micro hydro power plants, improved
cookstoves, biogas plants, and digesters.

All these programs, except for Lighting Africa, are partnership programs with
governance structures that separate management and governance functions (table
1.4). The Bank shares authority and accountability for strategic direction and
oversight of these programs through the governing bodies which include the donors

and the Bank. However, these structures function differently in each of these
programs in terms of the balance of decision-making power between the World
Bank and other partners. In some instances, the Bank makes most of the decisions
and treats the program as a trust-funded program managed by the Bank, while in
another cases donors are more involved. Lighting Africa’s structure is different. It is
a joint initiative of the Bank and IFC. This design has implications for both the
governance and management of the program. First, Lighting Africa has two
program managers – one for the Bank and one for the IFC. Teams collaborate daily
on strategic and operational issues but their work-- and their funding—are managed
independently. The programs also raise donor funds independently. The program
receives much of its funding from the World Bank and the IFC, as well as from other
global and regional partnership programs (table 1.4).

Despite the difference in their approach and structures, all four programs have goals
that are relevant to helping the Bank Group and its clients learn about how to
achieve universal energy access. Their broad objective is to help countries address
the obstacles to energy access through diagnostic analyses, knowledge sharing,
design and piloting of innovative delivery mechanisms, and capacity building.
Much of this knowledge and piloting can, at least in principle, be more efficiently
done by global programs than by individual donors or countries.


Scope, Methodology, and Timeframe
The review assessed the relevance and effectiveness of the four programs through
the following evaluation questions:

         To what extent have the four selected partnership programs contributed to
          their objective of assisting client countries in improving access to energy in a
          gender sensitive manner? Were their design, strategies, and activities
          appropriate for achieving this objective?
         To what extent have the programs achieved their intended results in energy
          access and how well have they performed?
         To what extent have the programs delivered knowledge products of high
          quality that generate new evidence and provide sound analysis and
          recommendations fit for the purpose of supporting decisions on the
          promotion of universal access to energy?

This review adopts a customized approach to assessing each of the four programs.
This approach was chosen because the programs are vastly different in size, scope,
and quality of their results frameworks. Two of the programs—ESMAP and
Lighting Africa—have recently had external evaluations which IEG’s team was able
to draw upon. IEG did not review these programs in depth, and chose instead to
focus on the quality and relevance of programs’ knowledge products, something
that had not been substantially covered by external evaluations. In contrast, GPOBA
has not had an external evaluation since 2007 and ASTAE has never had any
external evaluation since its inception in 1992. In the absence of recent external

evaluations, IEG carried out more in-depth review of ASTAE’s and GPOBA’s
performance and took a broader look at drivers of program effectiveness beyond
their portfolio of energy access activities.

This cluster review also departs in several ways from IEG’s standard evaluation
framework for Global Program Reviews:

       its perspective is sectoral, rather than program specific;
       it is not necessarily complemented by a recent external evaluation of the
        programs (allowing IEG to also cover partnership programs that have not
        recently been independently evaluated);
       it is focused on the programs’ energy access activities, not the overall
        performance of the program; and
       it pays very limited attention to governance and management structures and
        programs’ cost-effectiveness.

In support of the Bank Group’s emphasis on the “science of delivery”—and in line
with the programs’ common mandate for creation, dissemination, and application of
knowledge—the review adopts a special focus on knowledge and learning. This was
done through an in-depth assessment of a sample of 20 recent knowledge products,
published from 2009-2014. This five-year timeframe was chosen to capture the most
recent publications. The sample was purposively selected to include substantive
publications from all four programs and covering a wide range of energy access
topics. However, the lion share of knowledge products (14) reviewed are ESMAP-
sponsored, since it supports by far the largest number of knowledge products
among the four programs. The desk review was supplemented by interviews with
authors and energy sector staff using and following-up on these knowledge
products.

The review findings are based on an assessment of these four programs based on
multiple sources: a desk review of key documents such as major sector reports,
annual reports, monitoring reports, and external program evaluations; portfolio
analysis of World Bank activities and projects funded by these four programs;
interviews with GPOBA, ESMAP, Lighting Africa, and ASTAE staff and selected
World Bank Group task team leaders (TTLs) that have implemented activities
supported by these programs; evidence gathered from country visits in the
framework of IEG’s ongoing Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support for
Electricity Access; and, as mentioned, in-depth assessment of a sample of 20
knowledge products supported by the programs. Attention to gender was a cross-
cutting concern throughout the review.

INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, AND METHODOLOGY

The review covers the following timeframes for the programs:

        GPOBA’s work in the period of FY2006–2013 when the first pilot OBA
         project in energy access started;
        ESMAP’s work in the period of FY2009–2013;
        Lighting Africa’s work since its inception in 2009;
        ASTAE’s access to modern energy related activities in the period of FY2007–
         2013. This includes the completed and on-going activities under two
         business plans covering the periods of FY2007–2011 and FY2012–2015.

The remainder of the review is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews the
programs’ performance and results. Chapter 3 assesses the quality of the programs’
knowledge products based on a sample of 20 publications and a review of GPOBA’s
approach to piloting. Chapter 4 summarizes selected key insights on approaches to
expanding energy access that emerged during the course of conducting this review.
Chapter 5 presents concluding challenges for the future. Appendixes contain
detailed program descriptions and other supportive material.

        Program Performance and Effectiveness
This chapter assesses program performance and effectiveness: to what extent the
four partnership programs have achieved their expected results and supported the
goal of universal energy access. The chapter assesses each of the programs based on:

       The available evidence on results as reported by external evaluations and
        programs’ own M&E, where available;
       The available evidence on performance of the programs to the extent it
        affected the achievement of results;
       The relevance of their design and activities in relation to their strategy for
        promoting access to energy;
       The extent of gender mainstreaming.

The review finds that although most programs have made important and different
contributions, program performance has been very uneven and there are serious
accountability gaps. All four programs have supported activities of material
importance to energy access and the World Bank Group’s mandate, but the degree
to which the programs were integrated and coordinated with other World Bank
Group energy operations has varied substantially. Programs have room to improve
design relevance and to be more strategic in their choice of activities; in part, this
will require maintaining a proper balance between donor priorities and program’s
strategic goals. Performance reporting and monitoring has been weak for most of
these programs but has improved since 2012.


Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
PILOTING PRO-POOR APPROACHES IN ENERGY ACCESS
GPOBA’s objective is to facilitate learning on the potential contribution of OBA
approaches to the delivery of basic services by: (1) Supporting the design,
implementation and evaluation of a program of individual pilot OBA schemes; (2)
facilitating the identification and dissemination of knowledge on issues relating to
the role and application of OBA; and (3) contributing to the financing of output-
based payments for services under OBA schemes. The program started in 2003 with
the original mandate to assist in preparing OBA projects and to document and
disseminate the lessons learned. The provision of subsidies for OBA pilot projects
started in 2005 funded from an additional contribution from DFID.1

CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

While the program made substantial effort in taking stock of and disseminating the
key lessons from OBA practices, its objective to mainstream OBA approaches inside
the World Bank Group is still a work in progress. An assessment in 2009 found that
the Bank's OBA portfolio as of 2009 was 131 OBA projects with a total value of $3.5
billion of which only about 50 were GPOBA-funded.2 The approach championed by
GPOBA is a subset of the larger universe of results-based financing (RBF)
instruments (Box 2.1). Important gaps remain in understanding the merits of the
variety of RBF and in systematically distilling and facilitating critical learning.
Information on how projects using a variety of RBF models perform in comparison
with more traditional lending operations is scarce and dated.

To become a knowledge hub for OBA approaches, GPOBA should go beyond
learning from its own experiments and tap into the global wealth of results-based
financing work and develop stronger in-house expertise. The most recent annual
review carried out by DFID stressed the need for GPOBA to engage proactively with
the wider RBF community (inside the Bank Group and more broadly) to ensure that
its focus on OBA is not marginalized and GPOBA’s ambition to become a Center of
Expertise is perceived as relevant to those working with a wider range of RBF
instruments.3

In line with its mandate to design, pilot, and document OBA approaches to improve
the delivery of basic services to the poor in developing countries, GPOBA has
piloted 12 OBA schemes to projects in the 2006-2013 period (these are recipient
executed grants) that use diverse technologies to ensure access to electricity (see
table A3 for the full list). GPOBA’s pilots partner with both public and private
entities. These projects are well-integrated with the Bank’s country level work and
often build on existing IDA operations. Of these 12 subsidy projects only six were
closed at the time of this review (see appendix table A.3). It should be noted that
since these pilots have been recently closed, the lessons from design and
implementation are still being documented and incorporated in new OBA projects
which are beyond the scope of this review (Mali, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu,
ndZambia) and one scale-up (Bangladesh renewable energy program to be funded
by GPOBA) is in the pipeline for FY2015. Lessons learned from OBA in the energy
sector are also incorporated in setting up Climate Change Facilities in client
countries (e.g., Ethiopia).

In its pilot energy access projects, GPOBA either acted as a frontrunner introducing
the concept of output-based aid in the sector, like in Armenia and Colombia, or
aimed to replicate or improve the targeting of the results-based financed activities of
existing World Bank and IFC projects, such as in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bolivia.
For the projects where GPOBA replicated the OBA model already applied in large

                                                    PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS


investment operations, GPOBA’s value added was the fine-tuning of subsidy
targeting to reach the poor. In most of the cases, GPOBA built its projects on
implementation arrangements of IDA operations to reduce the transaction costs and
improve effectiveness.

GPOBA addresses issues on both the supply and demand side of service provision.
On the demand side, the low demand for energy access in poor households is
mainly due to high upfront connection costs and high tariffs. GPOBA scheme
addresses this issue by offering the poor targeted subsidies to facilitate their access:
in the majority of its 12 energy access projects, GPOBA offers connection subsidies
that support initial access rather than consumption.

On the supply side, especially in low income countries, most electricity utilities have
low cost recovery and are unable or unwilling to spend on capital investments for
extending the grid to remote or sparsely populated geographic areas. It is less
profitable for suppliers to sell solar PVs in remote areas as well. GPOBA’s OBA
scheme creates additional financial incentives for those public utility companies or
private entities to reach out and extend their services to the poor.

GPOBA pilots in electricity access have had mixed results and often faced
implementation challenges. Of the six closed subsidy projects, projects in Armenia,
Bangladesh and Colombia achieved and even exceeded their original targets, while
the India Slum Electrification project failed because of extended delays in the
implementation and the use of an outdated beneficiary survey. In Ethiopia, a
government-imposed moratorium on new connections outside the control of
GPOBA led to significant delays to most energy access programs in the country and
resulted in five times fewer household connections than expected. Successful
projects resulted in an increased number of households with new or improved
access to electricity.

The uneven implementation and results of these pilot projects point to certain issues
in how well project designs addressed key supply and demand barriers to energy
access:

       GPOBA relies on an approach with a fixed subsidy scheme where the level
        of subsidy and schedule of disbursement to providers are determined
        upfront. This has proven problematic in cases where subsidy levels were
        insufficient to convince utilities and suppliers to prioritize poor households.
        In Armenia, for instance, the gas company placed low commercial value on
        those additional consumers it would gain through the OBA scheme (their



                                                                                       15

         gas consumption was three times lower than the country average), and
         therefore was not very interested in the GPOBA project.
        GPOBA requires that suppliers are paid after work has been completed.
         Contractors and suppliers lacking access to working capital (a common
         occurrence) find it hard to finance upfront connection costs. A GPOBA
         project in Ghana which aimed to provide solar PVs to remote rural areas by
         providing microcredit to households stalled as vendors lacked the necessary
         working capital. The original design of the project did not anticipate such
         supply constraint. The project started to progress only after project team’s
         special effort to engage local banks to provide credit to interested private
         companies. While eventually the project succeeded and suppliers were able
         to find ways to finance their working capital and trade finance needs, ARB-
         APEX Bank decided that it no longer wanted to support the development of
         new business lines for its member banks. The continuing lack of access to
         working capital and trade finance and the decision not to start a successor
         project that would continue the subsidy program jeopardizes the business
         model that GPOBA had piloted.4
        On the demand side, in India Mumbai Improved Electricity Access to Indian
         Slum Dwellers Project, many poor households proved unwilling and unable
         to pay their share of up-front costs. This had not been anticipated in the
         project because the beneficiary survey to inform the project was carried out
         five years before the first connections were made.

Like other approaches to aid, the OBA approach is also vulnerable to external risks.
For example, GPOBA-sponsored projects in Bolivia and Ethiopia suffered major
delays from political uncertainty and changing government priorities. However, the
key factor determining success is how well the OBA model addresses supply and
demand factors.

 Box 2.1. Results-Based Financing (RBF) approaches and GPOBA’s Output-Based Aid (OBA)
 Approach
 GPOBA’s OBA model is a small subset in the variety of RBF approaches. GPOBA defines
 Output-Based Aid (OBA) as “a strategy for applying public money, through performance-
 based contracts, to subsidize the cost of delivering basic services and target these on the
 poor. OBA involves the delegation of service delivery to an operating entity, under
 arrangements that tie the disbursement of funding to pre-specified services or outputs
 that are delivered.” A distinctive feature of output- based aid is that “outputs are defined
 as closely to the desired outcome or impact as contractually possible.” Unlike some other
 RBF schemes, GPOBA’s model not only pays after the specified service is provided by the
 private vendor or public utility but also includes targeting in the design of the project to
 include market segments that would otherwise not be profitable to serve; GPOBA also
 hires Independent Verification Agents to monitor and verify the outputs.

REPLICATION, EXPERIMENTATION, AND LEARNING
The purpose of pilot projects is to learn about designs and mechanisms that can be
effective, efficient, and support scaling up. IEG’s review of GPOBA pilots in energy
access found several issues in project design that are important to consider before
replicating the model on a larger scale.

GPOBA requires very specific targeting and verification methods that may not
always be affordable and do not support administrative, financial, and technical
efficiencies that would be required for replicating and scaling the pilots:




                                                                                                                  17
CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

        While geographic targeting and self-selection (when granting higher
         subsidies for more basic solutions, or providing subsidies only some time
         after the service has become available) can be implemented easily, more
         sophisticated targeting schemes can be costly, time- consuming, and
         challenging in low-income countries with limited technical capacity. For
         instance, Uganda’s Grid-Based OBA Facility Project designed a targeting
         mechanism that required undertaking a poverty mapping exercise by a
         private electricity distribution company.
        Gradual grid-connections, that result from self-selection targeting, are
         technically and financially inefficient. It is more efficient for a utility
         company to connect all houses in a particular neighborhood than to connect
         selected eligible houses one-by-one, as it was designed in GPOBA’s Uganda
         and Ethiopia projects.
        The long-term follow-up maintenance visits—part of several GPOBA
         projects—required for suppliers to receive final payment, also proved
         unrealistic. Such schemes would likely be hard to sustain after closing the
         GPOBA projects unless there is a follow up Bank operation or the project is
         able to create and build on strong community ownership. GPOBA’s Bolivia
         project, for instance, envisaged maintenance contracts for four years, two
         years beyond the project duration. It was unclear who would make sure that
         service is provided and make the last payment to the service providers. The
         Ghana project had to make revisions in the service conditions to complete
         maintenance services before the close of the associated Bank project.
        The targeting methods devised in the GPOBA pilots do not always allow the
         suppliers to choose the least-cost alternatives to deliver the services, and the
         subsidy schemes do not provide sufficient financial incentives to cover those
         population groups that were otherwise unprofitable to cover.
        The funds allocated for output verification are high compared to the value of
         subsidies. While it is important to verify the outputs at piloting stage, they
         add to the complexity of GPOBA’s approach.

While some of these limitations are common for other RBF approaches as well, a
broader approach to learning and experimentation would likely add more value.
This would mean sponsoring an application of a broader and less prescriptive range
of results-based financing approaches that would allow more innovation and more
engagement of the private sector. This could enhance the learning potential of
GPOBA projects. While testing the OBA approach in new sectors (such as water and
sanitation) or areas (such as fragile countries) can provide useful insights, the pilots
reveal similar cross-cutting lessons stemming from GPOBA’s approach.

                                                  PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS


The program could consider sponsoring more analytical work and direct more
resources toward building a knowledge center for results-based financing
approaches to complement its mainstreaming efforts. More recently, the program
reinvigorated its technical assistance window to provide non-lending technical
assistance to helping clients building OBA facilities and introduce OBA schemes in
the energy sector. This effort is highly appreciated by World Bank teams since it
would allow more flexibility in experimenting with variations of OBA approach.

GPOBA’s work in mainstreaming output-based approaches could be enhanced by
providing more non-lending technical assistance to support Bank operations in
testing more varied approaches to results-based financing. It could also provide
more sector-specific, technically in-depth analysis, including of cross-cutting factors
critical for success of the OBA approach, such as design of subsidies or access to
finance. It should be noted that starting FY2014 the program has done more work in
this direction. Some of the examples include technical assistance, allocated to
support of Bank’s RBF and PforR preparation. GPOBA supported the preparation of
Tanzania Education PforR which is the first and only PforR in access to basic
services (as of end FY2014). Further, GPOBA carried out multiple OBA trainings for
donors and partners.

MONITORING AND REPORTING
GPOBA has established a good reporting system to monitor its projects; verifiable
outputs tied to disbursements are necessary for OBA and results frameworks and
monitoring arrangements are therefore designed upfront. GPOBA-funded
investment projects follow the same supervision and monitoring procedures as
other Bank projects. GPOBA staff participates in supervision missions for projects
that experience difficulties. In addition, the program has developed its own semi-
annual monitoring report template to report to donors on project progress and
issues in need of attention. These reports provide detailed monitoring of GPOBA’s
portfolio of technical assistance, dissemination activities, and subsidy projects on a
bi-annual basis and analyze implementation progress and trends. While it is unusual
that donors are informed about project progress with this frequency, Bank task
teams interviewed by IEG found the reporting to be light and not burdensome.

GPOBA operates and reports on annual work plans (IWAP). These plans are clear
on what the program intends to achieve annually and on M&E activities at project or
aggregate level (e.g., ICRs, GRMs, synthesizing lessons from several projects,
conducting impact evaluations). GPOBA issued a “Vision Statement” in 2008 with
an accompanying strategic framework describing how the program aims to achieve
its strategic objectives. This strategic framework depicts program’s theory of change


                                                                                     19
CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

and offers indicators to measure program’s achievements of higher level goals.
However, this strategic framework has not so far been used to report on progress
toward higher-level objectives (that is, mainstreaming of OBA and becoming a
Center of Expertize). The paucity of higher order reporting makes it hard for IEG,
donors, and other stakeholders to assess to what extent the program’s design and
approaches remain relevant, given also that the Bank has adopted a “Program-for-
Results” instrument and a variety of RBF approaches are being tested. One donor
has expressed concern that GPOBA’s current focus and approaches carry the risk of
it becoming marginalized.5

The program is stronger on information-sharing than on transparency. GPOBA’s
annual work plans, meeting minutes of the Program Council, and activity progress
reports are not publicly disclosed. Good practice in partnership programs is to have
more transparency in disclosing the key documents of the program. This being said,
the program’s website is a useful source of information about the World Bank and
GPOBA projects with output-based components. The World Bank operations system
still does not allow making an inventory of projects applying output-based
principles.


Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
PROMOTING KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING IN THE ENERGY ACCESS AGENDA
The External Evaluation of ESMAP 2007–2011 reviewed the outcomes and
achievements of the program during the five-year period from July 2006 to June
2011. Based on a desk review of 50 activities, including 9 on energy access,
supplemented by interviews and selected field visits, and excluding projects whose
outcomes are unknown or too early to assess, the External Evaluation found that the
objectives had been fully met in about half of the cases, and partly met in the
remaining ones. Overall, the evaluation concludes that, given its relative size in
terms of both staff and budget, ESMAP has been very successful in influencing
World Bank lending operations, and depending on context, has been relatively
successful in catalyzing private sector investment and moderately successful in
influencing the donor community. Main success factors relate to the existing
relationships and reputation of the World Bank in client countries, as well as
existing demand and timing of delivery of ESMAP products.6

IEG’s own review for this study also concluded that ESMAP has performed
reasonably well as a producer and promoter of knowledge and learning in the
energy access agenda. Its best publications have contributed to the advancement of
knowledge in this area with objectivity and rigor, their conclusions and

recommendations have been useful for the intended purpose, and they are readable
by the intended audience.

MONITORING AND REPORTING
As outlined in ESMAP’s 2008–2013 Strategic Business Plan, and reflecting the
underlying theory of change that ESMAP, with its three core functions – think tank,
knowledge clearinghouse, and operational leveraging – will help its client countries
make better policy decisions and translate these decisions into results-oriented
strategies and programs, the new results framework “will use logic models to trace
the chain of causality between inputs, activities outputs, outcomes and impacts for
its core functions. For example, indicators for the think tank function could measure
the quality and use of knowledge products created by ESMAP.” 7

The ESMAP Portfolio Review 2013 represents the first comprehensive application of
the programs new results monitoring framework, created in FY2009.8 It reports that
energy access accounted for 38 (21 percent) of ESMAP’s completed activities and
$12.3 million (26 percent) of total budget allocations during the FY2009–2012 period.
The Portfolio Review discusses the outcomes of these activities and, in most cases,
underpins the discussion with an appropriate outcome indicator. Thus, based on the
portfolio review, 14 of the energy access activities “informed” policies and
strategies, 3 increased knowledge, 4 generated innovative approaches and solutions,
11 “informed” development financing, and 7 increased client capacity.

In line with the new results framework, ESMAP’s recent annual reports have
supported their coverage of outcomes with monitoring indicators, such as the actual
“number of policies and strategies informed”, “number of lending operations
influenced”, “client capacity increased” by ESMAP activities in that particular year,
as well as (from 2013) the total number of academic references of ESMAP’s products
– a useful indicator of their impact on knowledge.9 The outcomes are not
disaggregated by focal area (energy access, clean energy, energy efficiency, and
energy assessments and strategy) but they convey a quantitative impression of
aggregate results. Thus, for example, in FY2013, ESMAP activities (in all four focal
areas) are reported to have informed 9 World Bank lending operations (with a total
volume of $1.2 billion), informed 18 policies and strategies, increased client capacity
with 9 activities, increased knowledge with 5 activities, and were referenced 161
times in academic publications.10

In IEG’s assessment, ESMAP’s newly revised M&E framework is well-designed to
track and report on the entire results chain of each activity. By focusing attention on
key linkages and outcomes, it has helped direct the program’s support for and

involvement with selected pilot projects in a highly relevant manner for
implementing a series of innovative (but also risky) initiatives at the cutting edge of
the energy access agenda.


Lighting Africa
PROMOTING MARKET-BASED SOLUTIONS TO ADVANCE ENERGY ACCESS
The external Mid-term Evaluation of IFC-World Bank Lighting Africa Project,
covering the period from program inception in 2007 to June 2011, concluded that
Lighting Africa had been a highly relevant and innovative program that had made
important contributions to the growth of the market for quality portable off-grid
lighting. Among other things, the evaluation found that the market intelligence
reports, such as Solar Lighting for the Base of the Pyramid, have been widely used
by industry participants for insights into product design, advocacy with internal
corporate stakeholders, and the mobilization of funding from investors and banks.
The mid-term evaluation also found that the policy and regulation component still
had few concrete examples of enabling environment reforms that could be directly
linked to the program.11 Comparing the early outcomes in the two pilot countries,
Kenya had better results than Ghana because of smaller market size, harder to access
off-grid consumer base, less developed renewable energy market, and more limited
government buy-in in Ghana, among other reasons. The presence of another IDA
off-grid energy initiative with different execution modalities but competing
objectives and overlapping beneficiary groups is reported to have been another
complication in Ghana.12

Lighting Africa’s mid-term evaluation also pointed to certain shortcomings with
respect to the program’s chosen monitoring indicators, which have tracked key
market developments, rather than the incremental contribution. Both the World
Bank and IFC LA teams reported the issues they had with monitoring indicators. On
IFC side the main challenge the team faced was how to fit the pilot program within a
set of defined IFC standard indicators that did not have much room to develop
customized indicators more appropriate for capturing the impacts of a
transformational and market based program. Lighting Africa had to track a large
number of indicators (71 outputs and 43 outcome level indicators). Following the
recommendation of latest evaluation of IFC’s Lighting Kenya and Lighting Africa
Global (December 2014)13 which is beyond the coverage of this review, the LA team
is working on improving its results framework. The team has identified a small set
of key indicators for which the team reports results in their supervision reports.

                                                 PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS


As for the World Bank Lighting Africa projects, since the Bank side of LA funding is
consolidated under ESMAP funding since July 2014, the initiative is implicitly
covered by the results framework, M&E, and reporting systems of ESMAP. To what
extent the ESMAP’s M&E framework would be able to capture the progress of this
pilot program is still be seen.

Thus, while the impact indicators attribute 100 percent of the quality-certified
product sales to the program, in the absence of an ex-ante market forecasting model
based on the program’s underlying theory of change, the additionality attributable
to the program cannot be established with accuracy. Nevertheless, based on
interviews and surveys in the two pilot countries, the evaluation found that
manufacturers and distributors attributed 50-60 percent of their sales in Kenya and
30 percent of those in Ghana to the Lighting Africa program, which suggests that its
impact was substantial. Lighting Africa IFC program‘s final evaluation also
acknowledged that more work is needed to determine the extent to which solar
lamp sales can be attributed to the programs and has made specific
recommendations to improve the program’s monitoring and evaluation before
starting new interventions. Among those is to improve attribution of sales to the LA
program by carrying out baseline studies in comparator countries that are not
targeted for intervention.

MONITORING AND REPORTING
Since the expansion of Lighting Africa its results monitoring framework has been in
suspension. Lighting Africa last published its Annual Report in 2011, and after that
it has only issued a first and only Donor Update in November 2012. 14 After that
period, the World Bank part of the program is monitored through the standard trust
fund monitoring tools (GFR and GRM), while the IFC part of the program reports
every six month through standard Program Supervision Reports s. IEG also had a
hard time to compile financial information on past and present trust funded
activities of Lighting Africa. There was no overall and easily accessible record or
systematic reporting, the data was outdated. In light of the rapid scale-up of the
program from its initial pilots in Ghana and Kenya to other countries in Africa and
Asia, the lack of results monitoring and reporting system is an important gap for the
accountability framework of the program. Although both sides of the program, the
Bank and the IFC, continue to monitor the progress through their own internal
institutional tools, integrated tracking of progress would have been useful in
providing a complete picture of the program as a joint World Bank-IFC endeavor.

The 2012 Donor Update reports that its target of reaching 2.5 million people with
modern lighting products sales in Africa has been surpassed by far; the market grew


                                                                                   23
CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

by 115 percent annually from FY2011 to FY2012, 15though as noted this cannot be
fully attributed to the program. Aside from market intelligence, the program’s most
effective contributions appear to have included the establishment of quality
standards and testing infrastructure, and business development assistance for
numerous importers and distributors of quality solar lighting products. While the
program has, to date, only reached about 2.5 percent of its potential market in
Africa, there is room for continued expansion in Africa and other regions.

IEG’s own review was able to confirm that Lighting Africa has played a relevant and
substantial role in facilitating the development of the market for off-grid lighting in
Africa. Its primary focus on the development of unsubsidized approaches bodes
well for the long term sustainability of its continued expansion in Africa and other
regions. The program’s design and experience could potentially inform the
development of market-based programs in other areas, such as for improved stoves.
The most recent evaluation of Lighting Kenya and Lighting Global also
recommended the program not only to expand its reach other markets but also to
explore the opportunity to scale up—that is, move up the ladder of energy access.
The program’s impact was not just in transforming the market for solar lamps, but
also in supporting the development of larger solar systems.16


Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program
TARGETED SUPPORT TO ENERGY ASSESS IN EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC
As a small technical assistance program housed in the Bank, ASTAE claimed to
support (i) early program identification work; (ii) project identification and
preparation, and supervision ; (iii) project-related capacity building in client
countries; (iv) assistance to TTLs for the mobilization of additional funds.

IEG has identified 34 ASTAE-funded (both completed and on-going) activities in the
period of FY2007–2013 in the amount of $6.5 million that aimed to support energy
access primarily in East Asia and Pacific region (table 7). Many of these activities are
linked to World Bank projects supporting different technological solutions ranging
from rural grid and off grid electrification to renewable energy solutions, clean
cooking, and heating. IEG’s assessment of these activities indicate that two types of
activities make up two-thirds of ASTAE’s funding— 1) “downstream” activities
including project preparation, early identification, piloting of new approaches and
some implementation support work and, 2) stand-alone technical assistance, mostly
comprised of knowledge products. The latter comprised one-third of ASTAE’s
activities and absorbed about one-third of its resources.

                                                                                        CHAPTER 2
                                                        PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS


At activity level, ASTAE’s funding generated valuable outputs in many countries of
the East Asia and Pacific region. Especially “downstream” activities— those related
to early project identification and preparation—were meaningful in supporting large
Bank lending operations. The TTLs also valued ASTAE’s contribution in helping to
disseminate the lessons from some of Bank lending operations.

The relevance and effectiveness of ASTAE-funded stand-alone activities, especially
reports, is less evident. IEG could not find sufficient evidence of client country
demand for some of the publications that we followed up. Follow up interviews
with the TTLs revealed that some of these reports were not linked to or not expected
to lead to lending operations. In some instances this was due to the fact that the
reports did not reflect issues of highest priority for recipient countries.

In the light of the fact that ASTAE claimed to carve out its niche in relation to
ESMAP by focusing on “downstream” activities rather than supporting “upstream”
analytical work, ASTAE’s investing in “upstream” work demonstrates that the
boundary between ASTAE and ESMAP in this area is quite subtle. Unlike ESMAP,
ASTAE does not have a strong internal control mechanism to ensure the quality of
knowledge products.

As for geographic coverage, the program’s relevance of design remained weak for
many years. By its original design, ASTAE covers two Bank regions. However,
proposals from one of these regions were discouraged during the last decade,
reflecting apparent bias rather than strategic considerations.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

MONITORING AND REPORTING
ASTAE’s theory of change with regard to its contribution to energy access assumes
that by providing targeted technical assistance to selected Bank lending operations
in the energy sector, the program will influence the World Bank lending and country
policies in EAP and SAR regions and achieve its objective of scaling up the use of
sustainable energy options. The program’s results framework formulated in 2011
expects to measures program’s success in contributing to energy access 1) by
increase in World Bank investments related to ASTAE energy access pillar; 2)
increase in access to modern energy services; 3) adoption of solutions for scaling up
deployment of renewable energy technologies and; 4) fostering of better informed
policy decisions and enhanced sector capacity. While the program’s theory of
change is clear, the adopted indicators and targets are over-ambitious and do not
match with the scope of a small trust-funded program.

ASTAE’s results framework could be redesigned to focus on the program’s own
inputs, outputs and intermediate outcomes that can be attributed to the program’s
interventions rather than to show a commitment to high-level targets that are
beyond its scope. This way the program could use its monitoring and evaluation
framework as an accountability tool. Striving to demonstrate high-level impact
makes the program to unnecessarily exaggerate its influence. Use of indicators and
targets that were beyond the reach and scope of program are confusing and did not
do justice to the program.

To date, there has been no external evaluation of ASTAE. 17This is highly surprising
for a program that has existed since 1992 and a serious and surprising omission.

IEG had difficulty determining what activities the program had funded and the
results of those activities. Activity-level information is scarcely available in routine
Bank systems; annual reports and occasional donor reports are partial and
incomplete but often the only sources of information on ASTAE-supported
activities. These reports often fail to indicate the most basic project and grant
information. Titles of ASTAE-funded activities sometimes change during
implementation; they are not linked to the Bank project they support. The program
was late in adopting the Bank’s standard trust fund tools. Due to lack of basic record
keeping there was almost no institutional memory of the program when ASTAE’s
Coordinator has changed few years ago. Such accountability gap poses a
reputational risk to the Bank. The situation has improved after 2012, when the new
ASTAE MDTF was established and the ASTAE coordinator made the compliance
with the trust funds management tools (GFR, GRN, ICM) obligatory for each
ASTAE-funded activity. It would be helpful for the program to create a basic

monitoring framework to keep track of inputs, activities and outputs and link them
to its objectives.

IEG found shortcoming in donor oversight as well. The joint ESMAP/ASTAE
Technical Advisory Group (TAG) has paid uneven attention to ASTAE. TAG reports
have limited assessment of ASTAE’s strategy and key activities and sometimes
appear misinformed, as when the TAG praises a “regional” initiative which,
however, at the time had already been reduced to cover a single country.18


Grant Making Process Is an Important Indicator of Effective Performance
Of the four programs reviewed, three— GPOBA, ESMAP, and ASTAE —
systematically allocate grants to fund activities implemented by the World Bank
Group (BETFs) and/or the recipient countries (RETFs) (mostly GPOBA).

GPOBA and ASTAE use traditional “call for proposal” approach, while ESMAP is
using a “block grants” method.19

GPOBA provides single grants through its Window 3 funding with an average grant
size of $4.5million. IEG found GPOBA’s grant-making mechanism onerous and
lengthy. According to the Program’s Operation Manual, besides the general criteria,
each donor that set up non-core funds has its own grant eligibility and approval
criteria. These donors also have different criteria for evaluating and selecting
subsidy projects (Window 3). For example, DFID and IFC have restricted their
allocations under Window 3 for the World Bank Group only, while the Netherlands
did not place such a limitation. DFID, IFC, and the MDTF donors review all concept
notes for each Window 3 activity, while the Netherlands left it at the discretion of
the GPOBA Program Manager. Task teams interviewed by IEG found GPOBA’s
grant allocation process heavy and time-consuming. It takes from six to nine month
for proposals to receive final approval. Whenever a project has to be restructured, a
frequent occurrence, a proposal has to be resubmitted to a panel of experts.

ASTAE’s grants are small in size (on average $120,000). Its grant making process is
light. Approval of grants has been delegated to the program’s management led by
the Sector Manager of East Asia and Pacific Region Water & Energy Management
Unit. Grants are awarded swiftly and on a rolling basis. Some task team leaders
interviewed by IEG valued ASTAE for its flexibility: funds are made available on a
rolling basis and ASTAE is flexible in approving grant extensions. However, in the
light of the fact how scattered and scarce the reporting against those grants was over
the years, IEG finds little value in such approach.



                                                                                    27
CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

ESMAP is using block grants approach (Annual Block Grants) which assumes
$500,000 annual flat allocation to energy operations units of all six regions of the
Bank plus variable allocation based on a set of performance based rules. The
program allocates its funds through a single call for proposals at the beginning of
each fiscal year. Several evaluations of ESMAP found ABG method effective and
transparent and being instrumental in enhancing the partnership’s efficiency.

The two programs using call for proposal approach had the weaknesses related to
the level of accountability and strategic use of funds. Idiosyncratic approach to
grant–making process and therefore, a large variation in the quality and efficiency of
the process, parallel to the Bank grant processing and reporting requirements, and
heavy involvement of the donors are common for such programs. The
unpredictability of the funds that the TTLs hope to receive through “call for
proposals” and the timing of receiving those funds prevent a full integration of the
trust-funded work into the general work stream of the units as well. In contrast,
ABGs are more predictable funds for the regional energy sector units and can be
factored into their work plans, thus, ensuring better alignment of trust-fund
resources to the regional energy sector strategies and priorities. The downside of
ABGs, some TTLs mentioned, is that these large annual block grants to regional
sector units create incentives for large proposals and rapid disbursement.

While each of these grant issuing mechanisms has its pros and cones, IEG’s 2011
Trust Funds Evaluation has found that request for grant proposals are not effective
for allocating non-country specific trust funds. The evaluation recommended
replacing those with block grants which are more efficient, since they avoid multi-
stage Bank-wide selection process and will allow adequate Bank management
accountability for the allocation of trust fund resources.


Integrating Gender—A Work in Progress
While none of these four programs have explicit gender-related objectives, the
integration of gender aspects in their activities is becoming more urgent and the
programs are taking steps to address that gap. The pressure to pay more attention to
gender aspects is coming from 1) the growing empirical evidence demonstrating the
different socio-economic impact access to energy can have on men and women, and
increased awareness of the impact of indoor air pollution, 2) increased attention to
gender mainstreaming inside the World Bank Group, as well as 3) stated donor
priorities.

                                                 PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS


Among the four programs, ESMAP and ASTAE have been the most “gender
conscious”, by helping to develop methodologies for integrating gender into the
energy sector work. ESMAP has helped to generate and compile knowledge on how
to integrate gender perspectives in the energy sector. Its handbook on integrating
Gender Considerations into Energy Operations and the online compendium of
gender resources offer practical help. ESMAP is also part of the Advisory Group of
the Energia— an international knowledge network program focused on gender and
sustainable energy. Nevertheless, ESMAP’s external mid-term evaluation found
that, while gender and social issues are generally well-covered in program-level
documentation, no systems appeared to be in place to ensure that such issues are
systematically integrated at the project level. With the exception of a small number
of specifically gender-focused initiatives, gender was almost absent from the project
portfolio. ESMAP’s Portfolio Review 2013 reports that of the total portfolio o f 271
ESMAP activities, only 32 had gender considerations or components, far below the
corporate scorecard target (announced in 2012) of 55 percent for World Bank and 60
percent of IDA operations.20 Following the assessment of ESMAP’s external
evaluation, ESMAP has put in place a systematic gender screening procedure since
FY2013. All activities proposed for annual block grant funding are systematically
reviewed by the ESMAP gender team, and opportunities to enhance gender
consideration are identified and recommended for incorporation.

IEG’s review found that most of the ESMAP-supported sample publications had
appropriately referenced the impacts and benefits for women when discussing the
rationale for expanding energy access, but only a few of the reports had deepened
the knowledge and understanding of this area. On the other hand, those few reports
that treated gender seriously made significant contributions to the knowledge and
understanding about the impacts of energy access expansion on women, and some
of the challenges and opportunities available for enhancing such impacts, as will be
discussed in Chapter 3.

ASTAE was the pioneer in funding one of the first studies in the World Bank to
address the issues around energy and gender in 2000. The study “Energy, Poverty
and Gender” aimed to understand how access to modern energy, poverty and
gender equality is linked and what are the lessons learned (China, Indonesia and Sri
Lanka). This study also developed a monitoring and evaluation methodology (also
supported by ESMAP) for integrating gender aspect into rural electrification
projects. As a follow up to that study throughout these years ASTAE funded several
cookstove programs tailored to women. The program’s results framework does not
have gender and poverty related indicators but claims to report targets and
indicators or any qualitative or quantitative results when relevant. The Program’s


                                                                                   29
CHAPTER 2
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS

funding application also requires specifying direct and/or indirect gender, poverty
and environmental impacts as well as regional impacts, including indicators and
targets.

Monitoring gender-related indicators is not embedded in GPOBA’s design. IEG
found no evidence of gender mainstreaming in those 12 energy access projects. The
only exception is GPOBA-funded impact evaluation of solar home systems in
Bangladesh which assessed the results through gender lenses as well. More recent
initiatives of GPOBA that are beyond the scope of this review plan to assess gender
aspects. Those include the “Impact assessment of Ethiopia electrification project”
(forthcoming) and “Mali Rural Electrification Hybrid System Project” due to start in
2014. The latter has an explicit gender-related indicator in the project’s results
framework.

Lighting Africa also does not have explicit gender objectives and does not monitor
gender impacts systematically. IFC’s completion note for Lighting Africa Kenya
reports that the program experienced difficulty in finding women technicians. Thus,
while the program aimed to train 80 technicians, of whom 20 percent should have
been women, it actually trained 94 technicians, of whom only 10 were women.
While no gender-specific monitoring is available for Lighting Ghana, the continuing
projects under the ongoing Lighting Global program have been designed with an
outreach program to include women’s groups in the supply chain, and the number
of women participants in training events has also been included as a monitoring
indicator.

With all four programs addressing energy access which can benefit women
significantly, it is important that they address gender equality issue more
systematically. That could be done through integrating gender into their monitoring
and evaluation frameworks and explicitly reflecting it in all aspects of
programming, budgeting, and implementation.

        Contributions to Knowledge and Learning
A large share of the World Bank Group’s knowledge and technical assistance work
is funded through trust-funded programs. Trust funds finance 46 percent of the
Bank’s knowledge services and 90 percent of IFC advisory services. The four energy
sector programs reviewed have a common mandate for the creation, dissemination,
and application of knowledge as the underlying strategy for pursuing their
objectives. This review of programs’ effectiveness would not be complete without an
assessment of their knowledge contributions.1 The assessment was also inspired by
the aim of becoming a “Solutions Bank” that blends knowledge and financing based
on client needs.

To what extent have the programs delivered knowledge products of high quality
that generate new evidence and provide sound analysis and recommendations fit
for the purpose of supporting decisions on the promotion of universal access to
energy? In search for an answer, IEG selected—and read in depth—a sample of 20
reports published from 2009-2014. They were purposively selected to include
substantive publications from all four programs and cover a wide range of energy
access issues at the global or regional level, as well as a few that were focused on
field study countries of IEG’s Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support for
Electricity Access. The sample is intended to represent a diversity of methodologies
and themes, but its small size in relation to the total program portfolios precludes
any claim to statistical robustness for the conclusions.2 The list of reviewed
publications is appendix B, and the review template is appendix D. Of the 20
reports, 10 were sponsored by ESMAP, and four were jointly funded by ESMAP and
the other three programs. The sample also included two reports from GPOBA,
ASTAE, and Lighting Africa respectively. The desk review was supplemented by
interviews with key staff involved in the preparation, implementation and follow-up
of these program activities. The list of people interviewed is appendix C.

The quality and relevance of the selected reports was assessed based on the
following criteria: 3

       Contribution to new knowledge that is not available from other sources
        (subsidiarity principle);
       Good use of World Bank Group’s comparative advantage (objectivity and
        global perspective);
       Readability; and
       Fitness for purpose.4

                                                   CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
Overall, the best publications substantively contributed to the global body of
knowledge with objectivity and rigor, their conclusions, lessons, and
recommendations are useful for the intended purpose, and they are readable by the
target audience. Based on the assessments for this review, four of the sample
publications have, by and large, have met this gold standard (see Figure 3.1). A good
example is an ESMAP-funded report on improving energy access to the urban poor
in developing countries.5 It documents and analyzes eight innovative projects that
had varying success in providing energy access to the urban poor, methodically
discusses the barriers they faced, how they were overcome, and derives the lessons
learned. Another example is ESMAP report that sharply focused on the promotion
of productive uses of electricity in rural areas of Peru with conclusions and lessons
that convey important messages to inform decisions on such projects in other
countries.6

Contribution to New Knowledge that Is Not Available from Other Sources
IEG’s review found that thirteen of the 20 sample reports have made at least some
contribution to the global body of knowledge on energy access. They generated new
data, information and analysis that are useful to inform policy, program and project
decisions for the promotion of universal access to energy. In five publications, the
contribution was modest and in two cases, minor.

The most significant contributions to new knowledge were made by reports that
combined sound conceptual analysis with the documentation of field-based
evidence from surveys, piloting, and experimentation. Precise and objective

CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
recording and interpretation of results from the ground generated the greatest
contributions.

An excellent example is provided by a tightly focused ESMAP supported paper on
the issues associated with the estimation of electricity demand curves.7 The paper
presents a brief overview of the underlying theory and demonstrates its application
with an econometric analysis using the data base from a 3000 household energy
survey in Yemen. The results are compared with those of similar studies in other
countries, and demonstrate the importance of basing electricity benefit estimates on
survey data rather than the commonly employed shortcuts. In a similar vein, a
jointly ESMAP, ASTAE and other funding sources- funded evaluation of the impacts
of a Bank-supported rural electrification project in Vietnam, based on a
representative survey of 1200 beneficiaries in seven provinces, solidly established
that the benefits exceeded its costs.8 The statistical robustness with which this
conclusion is supported makes it particularly valuable for future decisions on grid-
based rural electrification in Vietnam and other countries with similar socio-
economic conditions.

In the absence of ground-truthing even conceptual rigor can lead to inaccurate
conclusions. Thus, for example, a recent GPOBA paper makes a tightly argued,
theoretically sound case for the effectiveness and efficiency of results-based
financing as an instrument for leveraging private investors to focus the delivery of
energy services on the poor.9 But the case is mainly based on logical reasoning,
illustrated with the design of targeted subsidies in a few World Bank projects. One
of these involved the subsidization of solar home systems (SHS) in Bangladesh,
which the paper asserts are “typically purchased by poorer consumers” since, “by
definition…off-grid consumers are low-income.” The evidence from the follow up
impact evaluation, however, did not support this conclusion. The survey-based
impact evaluation found that at most about a third of the households had purchased
the system and they tended to be the higher income households in the villages
where SHS had been offered, which themselves tended to be the more prosperous of
the off-grid villages in the country.10


Use of World Bank Group’s Comparative Advantage
To what extent did publications reflect analysis based on international good practice
and unquestioned objectivity? The results are mixed. Just over half (11/20) of the
reports provided an objective analysis of the issues based on international best
practice, while the remainder did not fully meet this standard. The best reports take

                                                                               CHAPTER 3
                                                 CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
full advantage of the World Bank Group’s ability to offer impartial analyses with a
global perspective.

A good example is an ESMAP report on integrating gender into energy operations.
The report consolidates available information into a step-by-step approach, each
step supported with illustrations from the global experience and reference to
additional online resources.11 ESMAP and GPOBA also funded a comprehensive
overview and analysis of the financial and technical issues associated with electricity
connection charges, solidly grounded on data collected from every utility in Africa,
which concluded with practical, actionable strategies for lowering these costs and
enhancing their affordability by the poor.12

In reports that fall short of the desired standard, the most common flaw is the
absence of a sound analytical framework for deriving conclusions from facts and
analysis. This can lead to important issues being left unaddressed in the concluding
recommendations. For example, an ESMAP-supported review of World Bank’s
investments in modernizing energy services discusses the “inordinate effort”
required to access grant funds for technical assistance needed in preparing energy
access projects, but offers no insights on how to address this issue.13

A second common flaw is the omission of key aspects or information that should be
essential for a balanced discussion of the issues. For example, an ASTAE-supported
regional flagship report on how to achieve universal energy access in East Asia by
2030 carefully considers the economic, financial and institutional factors and leads
up to custom-tailored investment scenarios for seven countries.14 Surprisingly, the
recommended scenarios only take account of investment costs-omitting estimates of
the associated operational subsidies that would be required. Another ASTAE-
supported strategy paper for a clean stove initiative in Indonesia was based on a
review of two recent fuel substitution programs, but fails to discuss and consider
any lessons from the country’s far more relevant decades of experience with
numerous and diverse stove programs.15

The credibility of some reports is undermined by an insufficiently sober and
objective tone. For example, a diagnostic market assessment that underpins Lighting
Africa applies a bullish, confident tone: such as , e.g., using ‘will’ instead of ‘may’
about its findings—“cost reductions will translate into lower prices”, and “industry
leaders will consolidate” that make it sound more like an advocacy piece than a
balanced assessment of the market.16 In a different vein, an ASTAE-supported
review of Vietnam’s rural electrification strategies (intended for policy makers and
practitioners in other countries) is characterized by a consistently positive tilt that




                                                                                      35
CHAPTER 3
CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
detracts from the credibility of the important messages emerging from the country’s
experience.17


Readability
Most of the sample publications were found to the well-articulated and easy to
understand for the appropriate audience. A frequent issue revolves around the need
to signal the target audience through an appropriate labeling or packaging of the
report - as World Bank report, policy note, working paper, discussion paper,
research paper, knowledge brief, etc. Over half (12/20) of the reports are written for
well-informed decision makers and practitioners. A few are quite technical and
mainly intended for technical specialists. Three of the reports are not only technical,
but also difficult to read except for the most dedicated specialists. On the other
hand, the raw, unedited candor and integrity of a few of most densely-written
technical reports yielded some of the more robust and revealing contributions to the
understanding of energy access issues.

An illustration is the ESMAP-supported evaluation of the impacts of electrification
on small and micro-enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa.18 It provides a comprehensive
survey of the electrification impact studies literature and of methodological issues
associated with the estimation of impacts, illustrated with the example of three
survey-based studies in Benin, Ghana and Uganda. This analysis fills an important
gap, since the productive uses of electrification can, under certain circumstances,
substantially contribute to the financial viability of rural electrification and there
have been very few methodologically rigorous, survey-based studies that could
provide a solid basis for decisions in this area.


Fitness for Purpose
The reports’ fitness for purpose was assessed on the basis of the extent to which
their conclusions, lessons, and recommendations are grounded in analysis and
relevant for the intended objective. Fewer than half (8/20) of the sample
publications have fully met this benchmark. In several of the reports that fall short,
their fitness for purpose is impaired by their lack of objectivity and analytical
soundness, as already noted. In a few additional cases, the value of the reports is
limited by a failure to bring out the full implications of findings, even when the
underlying analysis was sound.

A few reports lacked alignment with the intended purpose. A major ESMAP
publication with the objective of “recommending ways in which the international

community can promote stoves that are commercially viable, convenient for users
and more energy efficient” provides an insightful review of six of the ‘best’
improved stove programs in India, all of which proved to be unsustainable without
government or outside assistance, and concludes by proposing an “intermediate
solution” that will require continued government and outside support.19 The reader
is left wondering if it might not have been more purposeful to have focused on a few
of the “success stories” whose existence is hinted at, in order to inform creation of
commercially viable stove programs. In a different vein, an ESMAP-supported
investigation of indoor air pollution (IAP) in Bangladesh aimed to develop
recommendations for a large-scale improved stoves program.20 But while the
activity yielded pioneering measurements of IAP, it did not result in any findings or
recommendations that could serve in the design of stove programs.Another example
of fuzziness about the purpose is provided by a series of country notes that analyze
policy and regulatory issues affecting the scale-up of the solar lighting market in
Africa.21 In principle intended to “level the playing field” by removing existing
distortions, the notes instead favor off-grid lighting solutions by advocating their
exemption from taxes and duties, without considering the potential impacts on
competing fiscal priorities and flying in the face of broader efforts to harmonize tax
and tariff regimes across product categories. It is possible that this may have
contributed to the fact that the external mid-term Evaluation’s found few concrete
examples of policy reforms that could be directly linked to the program.

    Insights on Energy Access from Programs’
 Knowledge Work
In the spirit of contributing to knowledge and learning, this chapter summarizes
some key insights on approaches to expanding energy access that emerged during
the course of conducting this review. The main sources for this chapter are
knowledge products sponsored by the reviewed programs along with interviews
with program staff, task teams, and key informants. The sources for this were
selective rather than systematic and comprehensive.

The review of knowledge products and of program experience found that the
programs under review have generated new knowledge and supported field testing
of some the key assumptions underlying new approaches to expanding energy
access. These should be of relevance to energy access practitioners. The key findings
and insights of this review underscore and expand on some of those of earlier
reviews and evaluations and can be summarized as follows:

       Rural electrification is expensive;
       The benefits of rural electrification are highly context specific;
       Solar technology offers a commercially viable alternative to rural grid
        expansion;
       Universal access to clean cooking remains an elusive goal;
       The challenge of sustainability calls for the nurturing of new business
        models;
       Expanding energy to the poor requires creative adaptations of standard
        business models; targeted energy expansion subsidies are not enough;
       There are several challenges and opportunities for enhancing gender impacts
        of energy access expansion.


Rural Electrification Is Expensive
Several reports have confirmed the unrelenting logic of least cost expansion,
whereby the unit costs of electricity access will continue to rise as the grid expands
into ever more remote and thinly populated areas. In Lao PDR, for example,
electricity access levels were approximately 50 percent in 2003, and the incremental
cost per household connection was $450-$550. By 2010, the access level had reached
70 percent, and the incremental cost per household had doubled to approximately
$900.1 Similarly high incremental access costs have been reported for Senegal, where



                                                                                    39
CHAPTER 4
INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
they average $725 per household, and Liberia, where the average has reached $950
per household.2

Rising costs curves imply that the pursuit of universal access to electricity will have
to be supported by a growing level of subsidies that will have to be covered through
direct budget transfers or cross-subsidies from the rest of the customer base.
However, while there is wide recognition and agreement on the need for subsidies
to ensure that the price of electricity is affordable in rural areas while protecting the
financial viability of the service providers, their magnitude and fiscal affordability
has not been adequately highlighted. Thus, for example, an ASTAE-supported
regional flagship report makes extensive references to the need for subsidies and
options for addressing them, but only in qualitative terms. It only offers a specific
estimate for Cambodia, where the cost of supply is estimated as $0.23/kWh and the
affordable tariff for rural households at $0.15/kWh. This would imply a subsidy of
$106 million annually for the 2.2 million rural households that are proposed to be
connected under the universal access scenario, comparable in magnitude to the
incremental investments of $156 million per year required to achieve that target by
2030. However, while the report discusses the country’s inability to afford the
investment requirements (equivalent to 1.6 percent of the country’s GDP), it does
not discuss the growing burden of operational subsidies which it will also have to
pay for.3 Given this and other low income countries’ very limited ability to afford
such subsidies, the absence of the systematic coverage of such major potential fiscal
burdens represents an important gap that deserves greater attention.

The technical assistance and capacity building needed to support energy access add
to the costs; since cross-sectoral solutions are challenging to implement. A credit
program may be needed to facilitate affordability by the poorer households and
small and micro-enterprises, business development services may be required to
assist potential energy using businesses in rural areas, and a major campaign may be
needed to raise awareness about the health impacts of indoor air pollution for
potential buyers of improved cookstoves. Such implementation challenges
compound the energy expansion challenge.

Benefits of Rural Electrification Are Highly Context Specific
Any discussion of subsidies for rural electrification will need to be informed with a
good understanding of the expected benefits, an area where several of the sample
publications have expanded on the available knowledge. A 2008 IEG evaluation of
rural electrification found that it is difficult to generalize about the potential welfare
impacts, as they are highly context specific. Thus, where the Bank had already

above the long-run supply cost of supply, even if the evidence base for many of the
benefits remains weak. On the other hand, the economic rationale for off-grid
electrification is far from clear, because of its higher costs and lower benefits that are
further reduced by technical limitations. 4

An ESMAP-and-ASTAE supported analysis in Vietnam found that household
incomes increased by about 25 percent after 3–4 years of electrification and that
school enrollment improved for both girls and boys. Given this, and postulating an
electricity supply cost of $0.09/kWh, it concludes that the benefits accrued to
participants exceed the costs of electricity supply by more than 4 times. However,
while the household benefits of grid-based rural electrification were convincingly
shown to exceed the costs of supply in Vietnam, a middle income country, such a
finding cannot be generalized to lower income countries and regions. In Cambodia,
for example, where the cost of supply (of $0.23/kWh) is about 150 percent higher
and income levels are about 30 percent lower, the benefits might only marginally
exceed the costs. This points to the need for additional survey-based research on the
impacts and benefits of electrification, especially in lower-income countries with
higher unit costs for expanding electricity access.

With respect to the benefits of electrification for small and micro-enterprises, the
findings are rather more sobering. An ESMAP-supported survey on the impacts of
rural electrification in three African countries found no clear indication for positive
effects of electricity access on SME performance.5 The survey found that connected
firms use electricity mostly for lighting and phone charging. While some of the firms
could benefit from productivity-enhancing electric equipment and appliances, there
is also a sharpening of competition and crowding-out of weaker firms that tends to
net out any aggregate impact on income and employment. A similar ESMAP-
supported report on Peru also provides a cautionary note on the productive users’
potential to strengthen the viability of rural electrification. It concludes that
promotion of productive uses by small and micro-enterprises in rural areas can be
financially viable under certain narrow conditions: if economic growth is reaching
the rural areas, the program is supported by strong NGOs experienced in rural
development, and credit is available to the potential users.6


Solar Technology Offers a Commercially Viable Alternative
At this point, the only portion of the energy access spectrum where the economics
are improving is the off-grid solar lighting market, where the costs of supply have
declined at an impressive rate. As documented by Lighting Africa’s market
intelligence reports, the production costs of solar portable lighting devices have been



                                                                                        41
CHAPTER 4
INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
falling and are expected to continue to decline. In parallel, the advent of LED bulbs
and improvements in battery technology have enhanced the quality and durability
of the lanterns, and the incorporation of features such as mobile phone charging
have greatly increased their attractiveness to consumers. As a result, African sales of
quality-certified solar lighting products have grown by at about 90-95 percent per
year since 2009 (albeit from a low base). These products have now reached 2.5
percent market penetration across Africa, and 7.5 percent in Kenya, where Lighting
Africa has been most active.7

On the other hand, while the market for solar lighting is booming, a recent GPOBA-
funded impact evaluation of a grant-supported program to disseminate solar home
systems (SHS) in Bangladesh concluded that while the willingness to pay was
high—implying that subsidies were unnecessary the impact on income generation
and education was very limited. In addition, in spite of mechanisms explicitly
intended to target the program to the poor, only about a quarter of households had
purchased the system and they tended to be the better-off and better educated
households in the villages where SHS had been offered, which themselves tended to
be the more prosperous of the off-grid villages in the country.8 Thus, while the
subsidized program was successful in meeting its sales targets, it has also tended to
undermine the potential for developing the non-subsidized market for solar
systems, which would also have to be built on reaching the better-off villages first
and, within these villages, the better-off households. Another impact evaluation
study (beyond the scope of the sample) carried out in 2013, has found that
Bangladesh program has generated a variety of benefits from solar home systems.9
This points to the need for additional research on targeting mechanisms to help
ensure that they can more effectively and efficiently reach the poor and do not
interfere with the development of the commercial market.

Universal Access to Clean Cooking Remains an Elusive Goal
Recent WHO estimates indicate that indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million
premature deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass
stoves, of which about three quarters (3.3 million) are concentrated in Asia.10 The
new estimate is nearly double the WHO’s previous estimate and indicates that
indoor air pollution is the largest single environmental health risk globally, linked to
about one tenth of all deaths. The ESMAP-supported measurements of indoor air
pollution in Bangladesh were highly relevant in this context.11 The new estimates
also underscore the urgency of raising consumer awareness of the health costs
associated with using traditional stoves, in order to overcome entrenched attitudes

                                INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
that have limited the marketability of the costlier improved stoves, as has been
highlighted in several of the ESMAP and ASTAE reports.12

Several of the reports confirm the perception that, even after thirty-plus years of
worldwide piloting and experimentation, sustainable access to clean cooking
remains the least advanced and most challenging of the major legs of the energy
access strategy.

The four ESMAP and one ASTAE-supported reports in the review sample that
focused on clean cooking have helped put this issue back into the mainstream of the
World Bank’s energy agenda after having received little attention during the
previous 15 years. They also provided the conceptual framework for the launch of
regional cookstove initiatives in Central America, East Asia and Africa.13 In contrast
to the earlier generations of improved cookstove projects, which had been mainly
motivated by the goal of reducing pressure on forests, the recent programs have
been driven by a growing awareness of the health impacts of indoor air pollution.
Based on lessons from the disappointing results of earlier projects, the newer
programs have been designed differently: they emphasize raising public awareness
of the harmful health effects of traditional stoves; development and testing of more
efficient, durable and user friendly designs; and include microfinance and/or
results-based financing components for greater affordability by the poor. While
these initiatives are still in their early stages, they have ensured renewed visibility
for clean cooking initiatives.

However, there is a need to more purposefully focus on understanding successful
clean cooking programs in order to support replication. In the face of nearly
universal dearth of successful stove programs, it is difficult to understand why an
ESMAP-funded review of a commercially successful improved stove program in
Bangladesh fails to document the business model and include any information on
the actual performance and durability of the stove.14 The same technical information
is missing from an ASTAE-supported report that features the single commercially
successful trainee from an improved stove program in Indonesia that had been
implemented by the very organization that partnered with the Bank in the
preparation of the report.15 Similarly, an ESMAP-supported review of clean stove
options in Central America fails to analyze cost-and-performance trade-offs between
the cheaper ($60-85) and more expensive stoves that are discussed.16

CHAPTER 4
INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK

Need for Nurturing New Business Models
An important cross-cutting message is that achieving energy access for all is not so
much about investing in infrastructure, as about nurturing the emergence of resilient
business models that will deliver sustainable energy services to remote and low-
income locations. Lighting Africa’s experience points to the potential for nurturing
commercial business models for the provision of energy access as an alternative to
continuing reliance on public utilities and NGO providers. Private entrepreneurs
have proved themselves resilient and adaptable for the provision of off-grid lighting
products. This is in stark to the challenge of reforming conventional utilities, the
fragility of NGO providers, the fiscal unsustainability of many government-led
energy access initiatives, and the elusive quest for clean cooking. Amidst daunting
logistical, financial, marketing, and capacity challenges, unsubsidized sales of
quality-certified solar lanterns have been growing by 90–95 percent per year, the
African countries where such products are sold have increased from about 5–10 in
2010 to 20 in 2012, and the number of quality-verified manufacturers has grown
from 6 to 25 over the same period.17

By contrast, the ESMAP-funded overview of the experience of India’s state-led-and-
subsidized cookstove programs highlighted the many cultural, technical,
institutional, financial, and political factors that conspired to thwart the
development of commercially sustainable business model for improved stoves.18 The
GPOBA-funded impact evaluation of the Bangladesh solar home systems program
highlighted the fragility of the donor-supported-and-subsidized business model
pursued by the provider NGOs in the face of numerous technical, managerial,
service quality, and billing issues, even while still focusing on the better-off
households in the better-off, more accessible villages.19 While Bangladesh’s SHS
program is considered one of the most successful off-grid electrification programs in
the world, with demonstrated results in terms of providing electricity to 50,000
households a month, its long-term sustainability remains fragile (i.e., dependent on
continued IDA and other donor support). Similarly, the ESMAP-funded assessment
of the pilot program for the development of productive uses in Peru, as well as the
study on improving energy access to the urban poor have highlighted the tightly
circumscribed conditions required to interest traditional power utilities to extend
unsubsidized energy access to marginal markets.20 While Vietnam’s experience with
rural electrification led by a committed, competent, and resourceful government
could achieve nearly universal electrification, this is not a model that is replicable
everywhere.21

The review of GPOBA’s subsidy projects revealed that when successful, the projects
resulted in an increased number of household with access to grid and decentralized

                                INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
types of electricity. However, the benefits generated through the application of its
OBA approach in increasing access to electricity are as susceptible to eroding as
those arising from traditional input-based approaches. This is partly because the
scheme is based on subsidy mechanism and once subsidy is abolished or reduced
the likelihood that the benefits will be sustained is very low, and partly because the
model does not address some of the key barriers to improving access, such as access
to working capital.


Expanding Energy to the Poor Requires Creative Adaptations of Business Models;
Targeted Connection Subsidies Are Not Enough
Most of the sample publications point to the impacts and benefits for the poor when
discussing the rationale for and experience with energy access promotion, but only a
few of the reports have advanced the state of knowledge and understanding in this
area.

The GPOBA-funded impact evaluation of SHS in Bangladesh found that only about
a quarter of households in villages reached by the program had adopted the system.
Adopter households had an average annual income of about $2000, 80 percent
higher than non-adopters.22 This was largely a result of the partner (provider)
organizations’ practice of selecting relatively well-off households as clients in
consideration of their ability to pay, while excluding the poorer households. On the
other hand, the report also found that the average households’ willingness to pay for
a SHS was much (30 percent) higher than the average price of the SHS, which
suggests that the program’s subsidy was unnecessary for the average household,
and could be more effectively focused on the poor.

The ASTAE and ESMAP-supported study on welfare impacts of rural electrification
in Vietnam found that household income and landholding had no significant impact
on a household’s ability to connect to the grid.23 This is the result of the
government’s policy to encourage all households to connect once electricity reaches
the commune, and because communes help defray connection costs for poor
households that could not afford them. Thus, once the grid reaches a commune,
poor households do not necessarily fall behind in getting connected. However, with
respect to the study’s finding that total household incomes had increased by 25
percent per annum after electrification, the available data did not allow a verification
of whether poorer households had benefitted as much as the richer ones.

The ESMAP- funded analysis of the benefits of electricity access in Yemen found
that, while the demand for electricity was highly inelastic for all income groups, it



                                                                                        45
CHAPTER 4
INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
was more inelastic for the bottom quartile.24 The proportion of lower-income
households consuming small amounts of high-cost energy greatly exceeded that in
other groups and the potential willingness to pay for substitution by grid electricity
was much higher. This appears to be due to the fact that many low-income families
on occasion used extremely costly energy such as batteries for lighting,
entertainment, and information.

These findings point to the importance of carefully designing the grid’s customer
interface in such a way as to maximize its affordability and accessibility by the poor.
An ESMAP-and-GPOBA funded study focused on the prevalence of high upfront
charges for a grid connection, which constrain electricity access for low-income
families.25 A main driver of high connection charges are oversized technical
specifications, more suited to urban areas with high loads than to low-load rural
areas. Another driver of high connection charges is the utilities’ lack of incentives to
adopt technical solutions that would be more appropriate and affordable to the
poor. The study recommends various ways to lower the up-front charges, both by
implementing lower cost technical solutions as well as allowing consumers to pay
the connection charge over time by rolling it into the electricity tariff or paying it
over time through credit schemes provided by the utility.

Yet grid expansion subsidies are not enough: the experiences from GPOBA-funded
energy projects indicate that poverty-targeted subsidies for energy access expansion
do not necessarily ensure results, particularly in grid expansion. The majority of the
12 GPOBA energy access subsidy projects use poverty-targeted one-off subsidies to
defray poor household’s connection costs. This choice avoids on-going subsidies and
issues of subsidy leakage to the non-poor. However, demand for energy access is
often constrained not only by high connection costs but also by the inability of the
poor households to pay the monthly electricity bill. Typically, the OBA model in
infrastructure requires beneficiaries to pay the ongoing monthly tariff for the
electricity, in which the utility company also includes a share of the installation cost
that the project is subsidizing. It is challenging to determine a tariff that the poor can
afford that also allows utilities to recover their costs. Paying even a share of the one-
time installation costs may be unaffordable for poor household: uptake in some
GPOBA projects has been weak. In the India Mumbai Improved Electricity Access to
Indian Slum Dwellers Project, many poor households proved unwilling and unable
to pay their share of up-front costs.

Project design also does not adequately address supply barriers to energy
expansion. The lesson from completed and on-going GPOBA energy access projects
is that the model works better in expanding off-grid than grid energy access, as was
done in Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Ghana. The design of the subsidy scheme,


46
                                                                               CHAPTER 4
                                INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
especially the level of subsidy and the disbursement schedule, often did not provide
sufficient incentives to convince utilities and suppliers to prioritize poor households.
GPOBA requires that suppliers are paid after work has been completed; for
contractors lacking access to working capital (a common occurrence), this makes it
hard to finance upfront connection costs.

A flexible approach to the design of subsidies and agility to adjust to changing
country contexts is needed to make poverty-targeted OBA approaches work better
and encourage more innovation and efficiency. One way would be to define the
target group and the service but to give more freedom to service providers to design
schemes that most cost-effectively deliver the service and achieve desired results.

An ESMAP-funded study highlighted the important role of community
empowerment and participation in overcoming the barriers impeding access to
energy by the poor.26 In five of the eight cases covered by the report, the
empowerment of poor urban communities played a crucial role in creating
leadership and capacity at the local level to build trust between communities and
service providers, enable the negotiation of supply agreements that facilitated the
extension of the energy supply infrastructure into previously unserved (or illegally
served) communities. Its findings point to the importance of stakeholder
collaboration as a key strategy for promoting energy access among the poorer
communities which had been difficult to reach with the standard utility business
model.

Overall, these studies and project experience highlight the importance of flexibility
and a willingness to experiment in providing modern energy access to the poor.
While the poor’s willingness to pay has been shown to be high, the levels of
consumption are smaller than for existing customers, so that the development of this
market requires creative adaptations of the technical, financial and institutional
parameters from that of the standard business models.


Challenges and Opportunities for Enhancing Gender Impacts
IEG’s review found that most (14/20) of the sample publications have referenced the
impacts and benefits for women when discussing the rationale for expanding energy
access, but only a few (4/20) of the reports have deepened the knowledge and
understanding of this area. For example, the ESMAP-supported impact analysis of
productive uses in Africa found that 22 percent of surveyed firms in Ghana were
owned by women, but does not present any gender-disaggregated analytical
results.27



                                                                                      47
CHAPTER 4
INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
On the other hand, those few reports that treated gender seriously made solid
contributions on the impacts of energy access on women as well as challenges and
opportunities for enhancing impacts. The ESMAP paper on integration of gender
considerations into energy operations succinctly consolidated the available
information supported with illustrations from the global experience and reference to
online resources.28

The GPOBA-funded impact evaluation of solar home systems in Bangladesh found
that female-headed households were more likely than male-headed ones to buy an
SHS.29Female-headed SHS households were also associated with a higher prevalence
of kitchen lighting and an increased sense of security and comfort derived from
SHS. Adoption of SHS was found to positively influence women’s mobility and
economic decision-making. Women were found to use more time for tutoring
children, watching TV, and socializing. The report also found that, while all of the
participating partner organizations aimed to empower rural women, only one of the
four partner organizations has actually trained 3000 women technicians to repair
SHS and assemble SHS accessories, while the others had not implemented specific
gender initiatives.

Another ESMAP-funded report, on improving energy access to the urban poor,
highlights the important role of women and women organizations in overcoming
the barriers to energy access in three of eight case studies.30 In Mumbai, community‐
based demands for electricity were led by a women’s community group, who
played a critical role in negotiating legal connections from the utility. In New Delhi,
women from the slum communities were supported to organize themselves into
self‐help groups, helped to articulate their demands, and trained to negotiate for
better and legal access to electricity. In each of the cases, the extension of electricity
access to slums and pavement dwellers, with the attendant improvement in lighting,
helped ensure safety for girls and women.

The report on the promotion of productive uses of energy in Peru found that about
33 percent of the producers that benefited from the pilot activities were women.31
This had resulted naturally as women entrepreneurs are present in all types of
productive activities and play a significant role in sectors of production such as
baked goods, milk production, ceramics and textiles.

Another paper, to underpin a clean stove initiative in Indonesia, reports that women
dominate the traditional stove making trade – about 40 percent of the businesses are
owned by women, 26 percent by men, and 34 percent are owned jointly by women
and men – but its recommendations only target women as consumers.32 As the
recommended clean stove initiative is expected to lead to the replacement of

                                        INSIGHTS ON ENERGY ACCESS FROM PROGRAMS’ KNOWLEDGE WORK
traditional stoves by improved manufactured stoves, this could result in some
potential gender equity impact, but it is unclear how this issue could be addressed.

        Conclusions and Lessons
The four partnership programs under review have made relevant, varied, and often
substantive contributions in support of energy access goals, but the degree to which
they were integrated and coordinated with Bank Group energy sector strategies
varied substantially. Programs have room to be more strategic in the choice of
activities and to improve design relevance. The overall performance of the programs
has ranged from highly relevant and effective to very marginal, with serious
accountability gaps in one instance. Performance reporting and monitoring was
weak but with an improving trend. While their knowledge products were of uneven
quality, the better ones have advanced the understanding of the challenges
associated with providing modern energy services to the poor, and their follow-up
activities have helped define and pilot innovative solutions.

Program Effectiveness and Performance
GPOBA has played a pioneering role in piloting output-based models in the energy
sector and sharing the lessons from its pilots. However, its objective to mainstream
output- based approach in the World Bank Groups is still a work in progress.
GPOBA’s energy access projects are well-integrated in the Bank’s country operations
and complement World Bank Group energy sector activities. Its energy access pilots
have produced practical lessons on the strengths and weaknesses of applying OBA
approaches. These lessons can inform potential efforts to replicate on scale. They
have demonstrated the need for more flexibility in the design of subsidy schemes,
especially the level of subsidy and subsidy disbursement schedules, as well as the
need close attention to key supply and demand constraints to energy expansion in
low-income countries.

The ESMAP program has performed reasonably well in its core functions of think
tank, knowledge clearinghouse, and operational leveraging. Its best publications
have contributed to the advancement of knowledge on energy access issues with
objectivity and rigor, and their conclusions and recommendations have informed the
design of policy reforms and the piloting of technical innovations, whose
preparation and capacity building the programs has also supported. ESMAP is a
good practice example of a multi-donor umbrella facility that is aligned with the
Bank’s work in the sector and effectively managed.

Lighting Africa has played a relevant and effective role in facilitating the
development of the market for off-grid lighting in Africa, for example by providing

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
market intelligence and quality certification. Its primary focus on the facilitation of
unsubsidized market-based approaches bodes well for the long term sustainability
of its continued expansion in Africa and other regions. It has supported market-
driven innovation in a manner that complemented other support.

ASTAE provided best value when it remained close to its mandate of early project
identification and preparation. The funding from the program allowed the TTLs to
pilot new models and carry out in-depth project preparation work in East Asia and
Pacific region. Its knowledge products were less strategic. A few of the ASTAE-
supported knowledge products included in the review do not meet the expected
standards with respect to analytical rigor and completeness of coverage.

While each of these programs has made distinct contribution to advance energy
access work, there are cross-cutting findings and lessons pointing to a strong link
between the design, funding and management of the programs and their overall
performance and effectiveness:

        Results framework: The quality of results frameworks and results
         monitoring significantly varied across the four programs—a common
         pattern in many global and regional partnership programs. ESMAP has a
         strong results framework aligned with its theory of change. The program
         undergoes periodic external evaluations, and is well-integrated and aligned
         with the Bank’s energy sector. In contrast, ASTAE has never had an external
         evaluation since its inception. GPOBA‘s Strategic Framework laid out in its
         2008 Vision Statement is underutilized. Its results are only monitored
         through its annual work plans and at the output level which does not allow
         assessing the Program’s overall effectiveness. Lighting Africa’s joint results
         framework is stalled. While both the Bank and the IFC sides of the program
         continue to monitor the progress through their own internal institutional
         tools, consolidated tracking and reporting was lacking—an example of
         incompatible systems between the institutions of the World Bank Group. Its
         monitoring and reporting is insufficient for a successful pilot program that is
         expected to be replicated.
        Managing “donor push”: The relationship with key donors had an impact on
         the design of the programs, strategic priorities, and overall effectiveness. The
         push to meet the donors’ strategic objectives put pressure on ASTAE to
         adopt an overly ambitious results framework and indicators. GPOBA’s key
         donors are directly involved in the grant-making process, as stipulated in the
         program’s Charter; but this makes the grant-making process unnecessarily
         onerous.

                                                             CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
      Program oversight: Stronger accountability for results is clearly correlated
       with the quality of oversight and how the programs managed their
       resources. Those with stronger accountability for results also had better
       record keeping and oversight of funds. ESMAP and GPOBA scored far better
       in documenting not only their results but also maintaining well-organized
       project and grant databases, while extensive detective work was required to
       trace ASTAE’s inputs scattered throughout the World Bank projects. Both
       Lighting Africa and ASTAE had weak institutional memory and relied on
       individuals to mine basic program financial data for documenting projects
       and grants.
      Grant making process: The grant-making mechanism was an important
       factor influencing program performance and overall effectiveness. Block
       grants of ESMAP were found to be more efficient, strategic, and monitorable
       than ASTAE’s just in time transfers of funds. GPOBA’s multi-stage grant-
       making process has high transaction costs for the TTLs.
      Gender: None of the four programs paid systematic attention to gender
       mainstreaming and monitoring of gender impacts. Among the four, ESMAP
       has helped to gather and disseminate knowledge on how to integrate gender
       into the energy sector work. ASTAE also did good work in this area in its
       early years. The review of 20 knowledge products revealed that only a few of
       the reports have deepened the knowledge and understanding of gender
       issues in energy access.


Lessons
      Flaws in program performance —especially those related to M&E and trust
       fund oversight like those in ASTAE and Lighting Africa—could have been
       prevented had the Bank adopted a more systematic and unified approach to
       overseeing its partnerships and other trust-funded programs;
      Periodic evaluation of the learning and scalability potential of pilots and
       innovations sponsored by programs are critical to maintain programs’
       relevance and to provide value for money. Such evaluation should be
       planned upfront and integrated in M&E frameworks;
      Accountability and results-orientation could be strengthened via more
       effective M&E and results frameworks that depict the underlying theory of
       change. M&E can also be an important learning tool for pilot programs,
       helping to document implementation and results;
      Gender equality could be addressed more systematically. A starting point
       would be considering gender systematically in program and project cycles
       and integrating gender into M&E frameworks.


                                                                                 53
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
        For partnership programs that issue grants, the grant process is an important
         part of program’s performance and a critical factor in effective delivery of
         results. The design and handling of grant processes strongly determine the
         accountability for funds and their strategic use.


Challenge of Ensuring Quality of Knowledge Products
Programs’ knowledge work undoubtedly supported the sector. While the best
knowledge products made significant contributions to global knowledge, fewer than
half of sample publications were found to be objective, analytically sound, and fit for
purpose. Only a few reports offered in-depth treatment of gender.

The major lesson from the review of the sampled knowledge work is the need for
more systematic scoping, quality assurance, and dissemination of knowledge
products:

        Guidance on scoping: a clearer strategic vision could guide the design and
         scoping of knowledge work in the energy sector with an aim to fill
         outstanding gaps. For example, there is a need for work on how to design
         subsidies so as to mesh affordability to low-income families with
         profitability for private suppliers; better documentation of how to make
         clean cooking programs successful technically and financially; and creation
         of enabling environments for private investors to deliver energy services to
         the poor.
        Quality assurance: Some of the sampled reports had common flaws such as
         absence of a structured analytical framework, insufficient objectivity, and
         inadequate coverage of gender dimensions. Too often, reports left important
         issues unaddressed in the conclusions, adopted advocacy, or lacked
         objectivity and rigor. More effective quality assurance should be considered.
        Gender: Full gender equality remains an aspirational goal, rather than a core
         feature of the energy sector’s analytical work. Many reports covered gender
         as context rather than striving for a deeper understanding of the barriers to
         gender participation and empowerment.
        Systematic dissemination of knowledge products: While all of the reports
         have been presented at least once within the Bank, the dissemination of
         several did not go beyond a few such presentations. Their impact could often
         have been enhanced through more systematic outreach and integration with
         training and project activities inside and outside the Bank.

                                                                           CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

Nurturing Viable Energy Access Business Models and Keeping Broader Poverty
Focus Is the Way to Go
IEG’s assessment of the innovative solutions GPOBA and Lighting Africa piloted
and the review of knowledge work suggest lessons for pursuing the SE4All goals:

            Nurture viable business models: Investments in infrastructure need to be
             complemented with viable business models that can deliver low-cost energy
             services to hard-to-reach locations and consumer groups. The proposed
             goals cannot be achieved by meeting the investment costs alone, but will
             need to be sustained by continuing technical assistance, capacity building,
             operational subsidies, and fostering an enabling environment for private
             investors. This points to the need for flexible design of energy access
             subsidies that address both demand and supply barriers and does not
             undermine market-based solutions.
            Sharpen the focus on the poor: Evidence that even with sophisticated
             targeting mechanisms the benefits of energy access tend to flow to the better-
             off households in poor villages and communities points to the importance of
             sharpening the focus on the poor through the use of complementary
             programs such as:

         ◦     Empowering the poor to participate in design and rollout of energy supply
               infrastructure and subsidy schemes;1
         ◦     Improving access to credit to enable the poor to finance the connection charges,
               internal wiring, solar homes systems, advanced cookstoves, and productive
               equipment that they may need to take full advantage of modern energy;
         ◦     Training and capacity building to ensure that the poor can operate energy
               equipment in a safe manner, maintain it for the long term, and take advantage of
               business opportunities brought about by energy expansion; and
         ◦     Making deliberate and systematic effort to foster gender-informed designs of all
               interventions facilitating access to modern energy.

Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid
ORIGIN
The “Output-Based Aid” approach was introduced through the Bank's Private
Sector Development strategy in 2002 and GPOBA was launched in 2003 to
mainstream the OBA approach in the Bank's program, particularly in health,
education and infrastructure. OBA is a mechanism for supporting the delivery of
basic infrastructure and social services where policy concerns justify the use of
explicit, performance-based subsidies. At the core of the OBA approach is the
contracting out of service provision to a third party — usually a private operator but
also possibly a community-based organization (CBO), a non-governmental
organization (NGO), or even a public service provider — with payments made after
the delivery of specified outputs. The purpose of GPOBA was to help the World
Bank Group develop expertise in output-based aid by developing pilot projects and
disseminating results. GPOBA was established by the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) as a multi-donor trust fund
administered by the World Bank.

OBJECTIVES
The goals of GPOBA are to facilitate increased access to reliable infrastructure and
social services by the poor in developing countries, by developing best practice
techniques for, and encouraging the broader use of, OBA approaches for the
provision of these services, and to facilitate the sharing of best practice and
experience among the broader stakeholder community.

The objective of the Partnership is to learn how OBA approaches can deliver basic
services by: (1) supporting the design, implementation and evaluation of a program
of individual pilot OBA schemes; (2) facilitating the identification and dissemination
of knowledge on issues relating to the role and application of OBA; and (3)
contributing to the financing of output-based payments for services under OBA
schemes.

To achieve its objectives the program supports a range of activities funded through
three windows:

        Window 1: Financing studies and other inputs to assist in the design,
         implementation and evaluation of projects piloting the OBA approach.



                                                                                       57

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
        Window 2: Financing activities to help identify and disseminate emerging
         knowledge on issues relating to the role and application of OBA services.
        Window 3: Contributing to the financing or co-financing of individual pilot
         OBA schemes and national or sub-national OBA facilities.

GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
GPOBA is governed by a Program Council and has a typical shareholder model of
governance. The Program Council is comprised of representatives of each donor
(called Partners), including a representative of the World Bank. The Partnership is
open to participation by official donors or international organizations agreeing to
make the prescribed minimum contribution to the Partnership ($250,000 annually).
The World Bank Group may meet the required minimum annual contribution to the
Core Fund through a combination of administrative budget and in-kind
contributions. Current members of the Program Council included the United
Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), IFC, Netherlands
(DGIS), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT, formerly
AusAID) and Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA).

The Program Council is responsible for setting GPOBA policies and strategies,
approving its annual work plan and financial plan, overseeing the Program
Management Unit and reviewing GPOBA’s performance.

The Bank’s representative serves as Chair of the Program Council, hosts GPOBA's
Program Management Unit (PMU) and administers the trust funds. GPOBA's
Management Unit reports to the Program Council and the Bank's Finance,
Economics and Urban development Department. The head of the Program
Management Unit is designated by the same department and is not selected by the
Program Council, which is often the case with other partnerships hosted in the Bank.
The program is managed by Management unit housed in the Bank.

FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT
GPOBA funding is comprised of a Multi-Donor Trust Fund called the Core fund,
and not-core funds which are single trust funds earmarked for eligible activities in
particular regions, sectors or themes. Currently, the DFID Challenge Fund, the IFC
performance-based Grant Initiative Fund, the Dutch GPOBA Water and Sanitation
fund, and the DFID Phase 2 Fund are established as non-Core funds.1

GRANT PROCESS
Application for GPOBA funding is open to international financial institutions,
bilateral donors, NGOs, public and private operators, and national and local
governments. Proposals are submitted by a Bank team, and for Recipient Executed
Trust Funds (RETFs), an endorsement letter from the client government is required.

The project selection and approval process for each of the “windows” is different.
The program’s operation manual sets outs how activities under each window will be
selected, supervised, monitored and reported on. Besides the general eligibility
criteria set out in the Operations Manual2, each of the partners/donors that set up
non-core funds has its own eligibility and approval criteria. These donors also have
different criteria for evaluating and selecting Window 3 (i.e., Subsidy) projects. For
example, DFID and IFC have restricted their allocations under Window 3 for the
World Bank Group only, while the Dutch did not put place such a limitation. DFID
and IFC and the MDTF donors review all concept notes for each Window 3 activity,
while the Dutch left it at discretion of the GPOBA program Manager. For Window 3,
a panel of three experts in the field of a particular service will assess projects
recommended by the GPOBA Program Manager, and endorse them or otherwise,
prior to those projects being submitted for approval in accordance with the approval
mechanisms specified by the Donors. It is a two-stage approval process comprised

of initial assessment of project eligibility and a final review to determine its
readiness for implementation. Approval of a Window 3 subsidy project can take
about 6 months. According to the Program the reviews of all RETF projects started
to follow a Small RETF Grants Directive which was adopted by OPCS in 2012,
making the process unified across the Bank. Some donors provide “No Objections”
to the GPOBA projects based on the Administration Agreements with the Bank. No
separate “evaluation criteria” exist. Furthermore, the donor agreed to increase the
threshold for the need for No Objection from $75,000 to $500,000 in 2014. This
however, is not reflected in the program’s Operational Manual.

REPORTING
The PMU reports to the Program Council. The operating principles provide a quite
detailed list of reporting and auditing arrangements for all GPOBA activities that
should be submitted to the Program Council. The PMU prepares semi-annual
progress reports for all activities as well as prepares annual report to the Program
Council. At the activity level, the Bank Team prepares GRM reports as well as
contributes to the semi-annual monitoring report. GPOBA has not undergone
independent evaluation since 2007. It is undergoing annual reviews by DFID that
are more tailored to the needs of one donor (although major) and cannot substitute
for a comprehensive external evaluation. These reports are also not disclosed.

ENERGY ACCESS PORTFOLIO
Since the first projects were approved in 2006, there have been 19 GPOBA projects
approved and in implementation, representing $70.54 million of which the lion
share, $68.77 went to subsidy investment projects.

Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
ORIGIN
The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) was established in
1983 as a global, multi-donor technical assistance trust fund administered by the
World Bank and cosponsored by 13 official bilateral donors. Since its inception, the
program has supported more than 800 energy-sector activities that promote poverty
reduction, economic growth and low carbon development in over 100 countries.

OBJECTIVES
ESMAP’s mission is to assist low- and middle-income countries to increase know-
how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy
solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth.

The program’s activities are clustered around three focus areas: energy access,
energy security, climate change

Energy Access Activities: For more than 30 years, ESMAP has assisted low and
middle-income countries to scale up access to modern energy. This assistance has
included advice on legal, regulatory and policy frameworks; training to strengthen
capacities of energy institutions; dissemination of best practices; and support to pave
the way for World Bank investments.

ESMAP’s energy access activities are focused around four programs:

          Africa Renewable Energy and Access (AFREA) Program: AFREA was
           originally set up as ESMAP’s Energy Access program for Sub-Saharan
           Africa, with delegated management authority to the World Bank’s Africa
           Energy Unit. AFREA aims to support the scale up of energy access and clean
           energy solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
          Support to the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative: ESMAP
           provided early contributions that helped shape the Sustainable Energy for

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
         All Global Action Agenda, and is setting up a Technical Assistance Facility
         to support selected opt-in countries in their quest for universal energy access
        Urban Poor Energy Access: Building on past efforts to address the unmet
         demand for adequate and reliable energy services by fast-growing urban
         informal settlements and peri-urban populations, ESMAP has set up a
         program to help increase/improve energy access for the urban poor. The
         Urban Poor Energy Access Program includes a component that is
         implemented in partnership with the Cities Alliance.
        Support on Household Cooking Energy and Off-Grid Electricity Access:
         ESMAP has supported the World Bank regional energy units in the design,
         implementation, and supervision of initiatives and lending project
         components on household cooking and off-grid energy access.

In addition, ESMAP’s programs on energy access are supplemented by broader
programs focused on strengthening policy and institutional frameworks, as well as
gender empowerment in the energy sector.

In the Energy Assessments and Strategy Program, ESMAP has helped governments
review, design, and implement energy policies, develop and strengthen institutional
capacity, and improve the performance of their energy sectors. ESMAP’s work in
these areas is designed to take good practices and policies from around the world
and adapt them so they can be applied to specific national and regional contexts.
This program also develops modeling tools and toolkits that can be used by energy
planners to support decision making in sometimes highly complex environments.
Most ESMAP activities in this program are implemented by the World Bank’s
regional energy units through Annual Block Grant funding.

 ESMAP is launching a new program on social inclusion in the energy sector, with a
specific initial focus on gender. The primary objective of the program is to establish

energy projects improves development outcomes, and to demonstrate state-of-the-

A Technical Advisory Group of international experts provides independent
opinions to the CG about the purpose, strategic direction, and priorities of ESMAP.3
The TAG also provides advice and suggestions to the CG on current and emerging
global issues in the energy sector that are likely to impact ESMAP’s client countries.

As a major part of ESMAP’s accountability mechanism, management prepares an
annual Portfolio Review to present the results and outcomes of the program’s
activities and, every five years commissions an external evaluation to review the
outcomes and achievements of the program.

Energy Access Portfolio
The ESMAP Portfolio Review 2013 (PR-2013) is the latest in an annual series to
present the program’s results and outcomes.4 With reference to energy access
programs, PR-2013 reports that they accounted for 37 percent of ESMAP’s total
disbursements during the FY2009–2012 period (for completed and ongoing projects).

During the study period analyzed in this study, that is, between 2007 and 2013, 55
energy access activities were approved for implementation, comprising $31.03
million in allocations, according to the ESMAP database. This has been trending
downward since 2010.

Lighting Africa
ORIGIN
The Lighting Africa program was launched in September 2007 with the goal of
catalyzing markets for clean, modern, off-grid lighting products in sub-Saharan
Africa. A joint initiative of IFC and the World Bank, Lighting Africa seeks to
accelerate efforts to light up the homes and businesses of 250 million people by 2030
by mobilizing the private sector to build sustainable markets. The program
leverages the comparative advantage of both organizations to support the rapid
scale-up and delivery of affordable, quality lighting products, most of which are
solar powered.

About 600 million people in Africa have no access to grid electricity, a number
expected to rise to about 700 million by 2030. These people rely on polluting and
dangerous sources of lighting such as kerosene lamps, candles and battery-powered
torches. Fuel-based lighting is generally of low quality and expensive, impeding
learning and economic productivity.

Lighting Africa was formed to meet this need following a decade of interventions
and research conducted by the IFC’s Clean Energy team and the Renewable Energy
Group of the World Bank’s Energy Unit. These predecessors included IFC’s
Photovoltaic Market Transformation Initiative (PVMTI), a 1998–2008 $30 million

                                                                  PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
program focused on the solar home system (SHS) market. Lighting Africa
management also drew on the experience of the Efficient Lighting Initiative (ELI), a
1999-2003 $15 million market transformation program focused on promoting the
penetration of Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL) and energy efficient fixtures in
seven markets worldwide. More immediately, Lighting Africa inherited the
activities and staff of IFC’s Lighting the Bottom of the Pyramid (LBOP) program.
The LBOP team spent two years consulting over one hundred LED and CFL lighting
manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors about market challenges and
opportunities for the private sector to increase access to modern off-grid lighting in
Africa.

Lighting Africa was approved in 2006 and country pilots in Kenya and Ghana were
initially funded by the Global Environment Facility and launched in 2007. The first
Lighting Africa laboratory was set up in East Africa at the University of Nairobi in
Kenya to test off-grid products for manufacturers and distributors.

OBJECTIVES
Lighting Africa’s objectives are to:

       Demonstrate market viability: Lighting Africa supplies companies and
        investors with intelligence on market size, consumer preferences and
        behavior, business models and distribution channels.
       Remove market barriers and improve the enabling environment: Lighting
        Africa has developed a quality assurance program, facilitates business-to-
        business partnerships through conferences, workshops, and a dedicated
        website, and works with governments to make the policy environment
        favorable for off-grid lighting markets.
       Build sustainable off-grid lighting markets: Lighting Africa supports the
        scale-up and replication of successful businesses and business models. It
        provides business development services for its associate companies, helps
        distributors and retailers access finance, supports the Global Off-Grid
        Lighting Association, and helps governments integrate off-grid lighting into
        their electrification programs.

FINANCING
LA has been funded by 11 Trust funds, ranging from $34,000 to $2.2 million, which
have now either been closed or consolidated into a single LA Expansion Trust Fund
($3.7 million). Total expenditures have been about $19 million since it was started.

GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
The World Bank and IFC each do their own fundraising and have their own separate
accounts. They also have taken on different aspects of the program. The IFC works
with the private sector to help catalyze the market and develop the supply chain
thru market analyses, quality assurance/standards development, and business
development. On the World Bank side, IDA works with governments to mainstream
LA through policy dialogue and provides financing for consumer awareness raising,
diagnostic market analyses, capacity building and piloting of deployment
mechanisms and also contributes about a quarter of the funds for the quality
assurance activities. All the IDA projects are harmonized with SE4All. As of July 1,
2014, the program is jointly managed by the Africa Energy Practice, mapped to the
Energy and Extractives Global Practice and the IFC Advisory Service Africa
Regional Management (located in Nairobi, Kenya.)

PORTFOLIO
Shown below are the four IFC projects and five World Bank projects that have been
approved for Lighting Africa. In addition there are 3 more projects in the pipeline
slated for South Sudan, Uganda, and for general expansion of the program. Three of
the IFC projects have been completed.

Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program
ORIGIN
The Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE)was originally
established in 1992 by bilateral donors as a three-year pilot program to mainstream
alternative energy in the World Bank’s lending and technical assistance operations
in the South Asia and East Asia regions.

In 2002, ASTAE expanded its reach from within the World Bank to the client
countries’ stakeholders themselves, and broadened its core business from alternative
energy to sustainable energy by adding a third pillar—access to modern energy
services—designed to address energy poverty and its impact on the environment.
Scaling up meant adopting a more programmatic approach at the scale of a sector or
a country. During this period ASTAE focused primarily on the East Asia and the
Pacific region. The FY2012–2015 Business plan focuses on promoting green growth
while still aiming to scale up supply of and access to sustainable energy on a
regional basis. This plan also aims to reintegrate South Asia and strengthen
ASTAE’s regional impact and to increase the emphasis on cross sectoral dimensions
of the energy sector, increase RETFs, and to establish a new MDTF. For the first time
the business plan was increased to four years instead of three years to allow more
time for implementation.

OBJECTIVES
Over the years, years ASTAE’s objectives were modified to better reflect the
changing energy needs in the regional and global context. The current objective of
the program is to scale up the use of sustainable energy options in Asia to reduce
energy poverty and protect the environment.

                                                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
ASTAE’s program is organized around three pillars that reflect ASTAE’s definition
of “sustainable energy”: renewable energy, energy efficiency and access to modern
energy.

ASTAE seeks to support innovative financing and delivery mechanisms; enhance
policy and regulatory frameworks; build capacity and share knowledge; and
promote cross-sectoral and regional collaboration for mitigation of, and adaptation
to, climate change.5

ASTAE’s funding is used to supplement Bank budgets to cover the incremental costs
of investing in those three pillars. The Program supports four generic types of
activities that cut across its three pillars:

       early program and identification work;
       rapid response support to urgent needs of Bank teams for project
        development (identification and preparation) assistance and supervision ;
       project –related capacity building in client countries beyond what can be
        reasonably seen as normal project preparation;
       assistance to Bank teams for the mobilization of additional funds.

GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Since its inception, ASTAE has financed Bank-executed activities using separate
single-donor trust funds. ASTAE is governed by the same Consultative Group (CG)
for energy trust-funded programs as ESMAP. (See ESMAP governance section for
further details.)

ASTAE’s Manager was the sector manager of the EAP infrastructure unit who
delegated day-to-day operations of the program to the ASTAE Coordinator. The
Coordinator was the ASTAE Program Manager in the system until July 2014 when
the ESMAP took over the ASTAE management. The coordinator managed ASTAE’s
trust funds, activities and budget. The ASTAE work program is established
according to the priorities agreed with the CG donor(s) in general, and especially
with those who contribute to ASTAE funding. The Technical Advisory group is to
advise the Program Management team on the preparation of business plans.
Occasionally it is involved in the review of impact of ASTAE activities as well,
especially ASTAE Annual Reports.

The ASTAE program has made some changes in its governance and management as
a response to on-going trust fund reforms in the Bank as well as to make its work
more efficient. Changes to the governance of ASTAE have been introduced to
respond rapidly to client countries' changing needs and donor demands, align with

recent Bank-wide practices of trust fund management, and streamline the process of
ASTAE management and financed activities. Major changes include (i) adding a
MDTF to the previous single-donor trust fund arrangements, (ii) adding recipient-
executed activities to the previous Bank-executed activities to create a hybrid trust
fund, and (iii) introducing requirements for grant funding requests(GFRs) and grant
monitoring reports (GRMs, ICMs).

FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT
In the 2007–2011 period the main funding for ASTAE came from Bank-Netherlands
Partnership Program, which committed $7.424 million for FY2006–2009 and SIDA,
which committed $2.355 million for FY2007–2011.

GRANT PROCESS AND REPORTING
Calls for proposals for funding are made on a rolling basis, to ensure flexibility to
accommodate unexpected needs and new development opportunities. Proposals are
submitted by World Bank Teams either for their own Bank-executed activities, or on
behalf of the client government or government-authorized NGO for recipient-
executed activities. The grants allocated by ASTAE are implemented by Bank teams

report on the implemented activities and outputs in the GRM reports.

ASTAE provides the following reports to monitor the program and individual
grants: Annual Status Report on ASTAE Activities (ASR) by fiscal year, are
presented to the Consultative Group of Donors; Semi-Annual reports (those were
produced at SIDA’s request for July 2011-December 2012 period), Grant Monitoring
Reports and; Implementation Completion Memorandum after closing trust funds;
and additional reports upon request from donors and management.

ENERGY ACCESS PORTFOLIO
IEG has identified 34 ASTAE-funded (both completed and on-going) activities in the
period of FY2007–2013 that aimed to support energy access. Many of these activities
are linked to World Bank projects that range from rural grid and off-grid
electrification to renewable energy solutions, clean cooking and heating. Many of the
Bank projects linked to ASTAE activities also received support (more often larger)
from other trust funds such as ESMAP and Australian Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT- formerly AusAid). The total amount allocated for these 34
projects from ASTAE is about $6.5 million.

Up until 2012 (during FY2007–2011 Business plan) ASTAE’s work was focused
mostly on East Asia and Pacific countries, but has more recently been implementing
activities in India, Bangladesh and Timor-Leste.

1According to GPOBA as of October 2013, it is no longer using a distinction into “core” and “non -core”, which
was reflected in all of GPOBA’s administration agreements except “DFID1” (Main TF) that expired in FY 2014.
This however is not reflected in the program’s Operations Manual.
2
  Those criteria include consistency with the GPOBA's threshold eligibility criteria (Eligible Schemes, Eligible
Services, Eligible Activities, Eligible Countries, Eligible Expenses); Consistency with Indicative Work Plans
approved by the Program Council, or in the case of Non-Core Funds, with criteria specified by relevant Donors;
In the case of individual OBA schemes, the commitment of the host government to the proposed scheme; the
expected availability of funding for the output-based payments under the scheme; and the desirability of testing
a variety of approaches to output-based aid in a variety of sectors and country contexts; Additionally: Funding
should not be more readily available from other sources; Co-financing: GPOBA resources may cover up to 100
percent of the costs of an Eligible Activity. However, co-financing from other sources is encouraged; Value for
Money: Activities should aim to ensure value for money, including adopting the lowest cost strategies
consistent with appropriate standards of quality.

 The climate change approach is new, related to the programs’ focus on green growth, although ASTAE has
been active in this area for some time. It has been added to emphasize ASTAE’s increasing commitment to this
approach.
