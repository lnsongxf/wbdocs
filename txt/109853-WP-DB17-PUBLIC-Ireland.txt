This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       File necessary materials with the Companies Registration Office
       (CRO)

       A founder may register a company at the Companies Registration Office
       (CRO) by three methods:
       1. The CORE registration system, in which the papers for incorporation
       are lodged in print and electronic form. Under this scheme, the
       memorandum and articles of association must be submitted in CRO•
       preapproved format. After the documents are filed, the CORE
       incorporates the company within 5 working days (typically within 3
       working days).
       2. A “Fe Phrainn” system, in which (as detailed in the first method) the
       incorporation documents are submitted to the CRO in a preapproved                         EUR 50 for with
       format. Under this method, however, documents are submitted in print                        pre-approved
       form only, and the CRO incorporates the company within 10 working                        memorandum and
   1                                                                               3 days
       days.                                                                                   articles, EUR 100 for
       3. An alternate system in which the incorporation documents are                                standard
       submitted to the CRO in print form, but the memorandum and articles                          registration
       of association are not in a preapproved format. In this instance, the
       CRO incorporates the company in 2–4 weeks.

       To access the first two systems, to the company founder must apply to
       the CRO for an access number and have the memorandum and articles
       of association approved in advance. Usually only professional agencies
       use the expedited systems.

       Necessary documents for limited companies:
       • Memorandum and articles of association.
       • List of directors, secretary, and subscribers.
       • Statement of nominal (authorized) and issued share capital and

                                                                                    complete
      consideration paid.
      • Notice of registered office.
      • Statement of the main business activities and the address where they
      will be carried out, contained in a statutory notice sent to the CRO.

      Forms can be downloaded from the CRO Web site. For all methods, a
      CRO Form A1 must be submitted with details of the company name, the
      first election of directors and secretary, and the subscribers to the
      memorandum and articles of association; the authorized and issued
      share capital; and the registered office and the details of the location in
      the state where the central administration and the main company
      activities are proposed to be undertaken. The memorandum and
      articles of association, signed by the subscriber shareholders, will also
      be submitted to the CRO.

      As of April 2006 professional incorporators do not have to reregister
      the preapproved memorandum and articles of association - When using
      the CORE system only those pages that are company specific of the
      pre-approved memorandum and articles of association need be
      submitted with an application to incorporate a company. The Company
      Law Enforcement Act 2001 had already made provisions for the
      registration of a pro forma or model memorandum and articles of
      association. Pursuant to the new provisions, these documents, once
      registered, may be referenced and need not be filed with every new
      incorporation.

      Since September, 2009, it is possible to reserve the proposed company
      name in advance of submitting the incorporation papers. The
      advantage of this is that it avoids the rejection of the proposed name
      by the Companies Registration Office either because it has already been
      taken or because it is inappropriate for some other reason (such as
      public policy). There is a fee charged of EUR 25 but this fee is then
      taken off the incorporation fee meaning that there is in effect no cost.

      A registration fee of EUR 100 is charged for each model memorandum
      and articles of association registered with the Office. However, the use
      of the model company incorporation documents, using the CRO disk
      system, will result in a reduced incorporation fee of EUR 50. The
      company registration fee for procedures other than the new ones is
      EUR 100.

        According to Article 17(1)(a) of the Planning and Development
        Regulations 2001 -- 2011, the planning application must be
        published in an authorized newspaper for 15 days. A copy of

        sections, a copy of the newspaper notice and a copy of the site
        notice erected 15 days prior to submission of all documents. 10

      application. The site notice must be placed on site for five weeks
      from the date of receipt of the planning application. If it
      becomes illegible or is removed, it must be replaced immediately
      as failure to do so will invalidate the application. The site notice
      must be located at the entrance to the private road where it
      meets the public road, and at the entrance to the site. The
      Municipality will conduct several inspections during these 5
      weeks to verify that the Site Notice has not been removed or
      become illegible.

      It may be necessary to submit an environmental impact
      statement to accompany the planning application where the
      local planning authority considers, by reference to the
      characteristics of the development, its location or the
      characteristics of the environmental impacts from the
      development, that the development is likely to have a significant
      effect on the environment.

      If the local planning authority considers that the development is
      likely to have a significant effect on a site protected under the
      Habitats or Birds Directives (or sites proposed for protection
      under the Habitats or Birds Directives), it may also be necessary
      to submit an 'appropriate assessment' of the predicted impacts
      of the proposed development on the relevant protected site(s).

      According to Development Contribution Scheme 2013 - 2015
      (under Section 48, Planning & Development Act, 2000 as
      amended), BuildCo is required to pay a general contribution fee
      in respect of general public infrastructure and facilities benefiting
      development in the area of the planning authority.

      The time specified by law (55 days) represents the minimum
      statutory time period within which the planning authority may, at
      first instance, make a decision on the planning application. This
      time period may be, and in most cases is, exceeded by the
      relevant local planning authority requesting further information
      from the applicant. A valid request for further information has
      the effect of stopping time running against the planning
      authority.

      However, in practice it takes around 90 days in practice, on the
      basis that a request for further information is made by the
      planning authority. This period does not include the time for
      appeal of the decision made by the local planning authority at
      first instance. An appeal against the decision made by the local
      planning authority may be made to the planning appeals board
      (An Bord Pleanála) within 4 weeks of the date of the decision of
      the local planning authority. The appeal process, which may
      include an oral hearing, may delay the commencement of
      construction between 4-8 months or even more.

      Pursuant to Regulation 6 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at
      Work Regulations, 2006, BuildCo must appoint in writing for
      every project:
      • A competent project supervisor for the design process
      • A competent project supervisor for the construction stage

      Pursuant to Regulation 10 of the Regulations, BuildCo has a duty
      to give notice in writing to the Health and Safety Authority in
      their approved forms (Forms AF1 & AF2) of these appointments.
      The forms are to be sent by registered post to the Health and
      Safety Authority, Metropolitan Building. BuildCo must receive
      written confirmation of acceptance of the appointments.

      Provision of these forms is required under the relevant health
      and safety legislation, and is therefore a procedure that must be
      complied with.

      In accordance with the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (No. 50 of
      2013) enacted on 25 December 2013 a range of statutory water
      services functions transfer from local authorities to Irish Water
      from 1st January 2014. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council
      has been notified by the Department of the Environment,
      Heritage and Local Government that after 1st January 2014,
      planning authorities, when granting permission, should no
      longer include a portion in respect of water services
      infrastructure in any development contribution applied. A charge
      in respect of water services infrastructure provision in respect of
      developments granted planning permission after 1st January
      2014 will instead be levied by Irish Water. Therefore the
      development charges are now €74.10/sq.m. , excluding any
      contribution towards water services.

      Request and obtain fire safety certificate

      A fire safety certificate is required before a building may be
      lawfully occupied. In order to ensure that the design and
      construction is in accordance with the relevant statutory fire
      safety requirements, an application for the fire safety certificate
      should be made prior to construction or, at a minimum, 90 days
      prior to completion, to prevent any delay in the occupation of
      the building.

      The application must be accompanied by a fire safety report,
      drawings and specifications and the relevant fee. A revised fire
*4    safety certificate may be required where planning permission is         78 days       EUR 3,772
      granted for a revised design or where a significant revision is
      made to the design for which a fire safety certificate has been
      granted.

      It is important that the full application fee accompany the
      application for a fire safety certificate, as the application may
      otherwise be deemed invalid and returned by the local authority.

      Builders have the option to commence development without
      waiting until a Fire Safety Certificate is issued, according to the 7
      Day Notice I. 351 of 2009 Building Control (Amendment)
      Regulations 2009).
Doing Business 2017                     Ireland                                                            32

      Once a firm submits a valid application for a fire safety
      certificate, it may submit a 7-day notice to the local planning
      authority and sign a statutory declaration that Part B (Fire Safety)
      requirements will be complied with. Once this is carried out and
      upon expiration of the 7-day period, the developer can
      commence development without waiting for the fire safety
      certificate to be issued.

      However, the 7-day notice can only be submitted where a valid
      application for a fire safety certificate is made. A fire safety
      certificate will still have to be issued for the development. The
      time period for the issuance of a fire safety certificate remains
      (up to) 78 days.




      Agency: Fire Safety Department of Local Authority



      Request and obtain a disability access certificate

      Since January 2010, all buildings have to obtain a disability
      access certificate. An architect or other professional prepares the
      access certificate application to confirm that the design of the
      building meets the recommendations of Part M of the Building
      Control Regulations. The Building Control Authority (Local
      Authority) reviews the application and proceeds to issue the
      certificate if it is in order.

      To avoid potentially expensive remedial work, it would be
      considered good practice to apply for the certificate at the same      60 days       EUR 800
*5
      time as the fire safety certificate, thereby ensuring that the
      certificate and any conditions pertaining to it are known prior to
      the commencement of works.

      A building may not be operated or occupied unless such a
      certificate has been granted.

      Submit a commencement notice

      According to The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations
      2014 (the Regulations), which came into effect on 1 March 2014,
      a commencement notice or seven-day notice must be submitted
      to the building control authority. A 7 day notice is similar to a      0.5 days       EUR 30

        Completion Certificate is required, ESB Networks must obtain
        electronically a validated Electrical Completion Certificate from the
        electrical contractor's regulatory body before connecting the electrical
        installation to the network.
        The electrical contractor is normally member of one of the following
        regulating bodies: Electrical Contractors Safety & Standards Association
        Ltd (ECSSA) and Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland (RECI).
        Among the situations where an Electro Technical Council of Ireland
        certificate is required are:

        • Building an extension to an existing house or premises
        • Altering the internal electrical wiring in any existing house or premises
        • Reconnecting a house or premises (if vacant for more than 6 months)
        • Connecting electric fences and other installations

        Register with electricity supplier and obtain meter installation and
        final connection from ESB Networks

        If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is less than 30 kVA, they can
        contact the Supplier of their choice or they may contact ESB Networks to
        request that their connection be made live.
        If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is greater than or equal to
        30kVA, the client must register with an electricity supplier of their choice.
        The client will need the following information when contacting a
        supplier:
        • Meter Point Reference Number
        • The address of the new premises
   5    • Name and contact details                                                      7 calendar days      EUR 7,600
        The supplier will pass on the information to ESB Networks.
        The client is assumed to obtain their electricity from ESB Independent
        Energy (ESBIE) that is part of ESB Group.
        Once the external works are done and ESB Networks has received both
        the signed Connection Agreement and confirmation that a valid Electro
        Technical Council of Ireland wiring certificate has been issued for the
        client’s premises, connection can be energized.

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
