iii    PhilippineS ECONOMIC UPDATE • April 2017
Part I:

Recent Economic and Policy Developments
The Philippine economy remained resilient to global headwinds in 2016, as robust domestic demand pushed
the GDP growth rate to 6.8 percent, year-on-year. Capital formation drove overall growth for the first time since
2013, supported by an expansionary fiscal policy focused on public infrastructure spending, which spurred
construction activity. Consumption growth accelerated significantly for the second consecutive year, as an
accommodative monetary policy kept interest rates low, supporting consumer lending while low inflation
boosted households’ purchasing power. Meanwhile, a continued increase in remittance inflows bolstered
household consumption. However, import growth outpaced export growth due to softer external demand in
a weaker-than-expected global economy. The industrial and services sectors expanded, while the agriculture
sector contracted due to structural vulnerabilities. Growth has become more inclusive in recent years, and the
expansion in 2016 contributed to increased job creation. By the end of the year, the unemployment rate had
fallen to a historic low of 4.7 percent. However, underemployment has remained high at around 20 percent
over the last ten years, raising job-quality concerns. The industrial and services sectors drove job creation in
2016, largely offsetting substantial job losses in the agriculture sector. The latest available poverty estimates,
which are based on 2015 data, show a significant reduction in national poverty levels, with the incidence of
poverty declining from 25.2 percent in 2012 to 21.6 percent in 2015.

    The GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.8 percent year-on-year in 2016, up almost 1 percentage point

2       PhilippineS ECONOMIC UPDATE • April 2017
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

 Box 1	 Recent trends in global growth

  Slowing global trade, weak investment, and heightened policy uncertainty have depressed
  worldwide economic activity. Global growth is estimated to have grown at 2.3 percent in 2016,
  its weakest performance since the global financial crisis.

  Advanced economies continue to struggle with subdued growth rates and low inflation levels
  in a context of increased policy uncertainty, tepid investment, and sluggish productivity
  growth. Economic activity decelerated in the United States and, to a lesser degree, in other
  major economies. As a result, the aggregate growth rate among advanced economies is
  estimated to have slowed to 1.7 percent in 2016. The anemic growth in advanced economies
  was accompanied by a further weakening of global trade. Global trade growth slowed further in
  2016 as soft imports from major economies continued to depress trade flows, compounded by
  structural factors and increased protectionism. Meanwhile, the rise in U.S. Treasury yields since
  early November has led to a notable tightening of financing conditions for emerging markets and
  developing economies, in some cases resulting in significant currency depreciation and portfolio
  outflows. Nevertheless, financing conditions remain generally favorable, as major central banks
  maintain their accommodative monetary stance.

  Together, emerging markets and developing economies grew at an estimated aggregate rate of
  3.4 percent in 2016, broadly in line with previous expectations. Commodity exporters continued
  to grow at markedly lower rates than commodity importers. The aggregate growth rate among
  commodity exporters was estimated at just 0.3 percent in 2016. Improved performance among
  some large emerging markets and developing economies exporters—including a more rapid
  bottoming-out in the Russian Federation and a slowing contraction in Brazil—and an increase in
  commodity prices from their early-2016 lows helped offset weaknesses among other exporters,
  especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, commodity importers grew at an estimated
  aggregate rate of 5.6 percent, reflecting resilient domestic demand, low commodity prices, and
  generally accommodative macroeconomic policies.

  Sluggish global growth underscores the need to implement structural reforms that support
  domestic demand and reinvigorate investment. In advanced economies, extremely low and
  even negative real equilibrium interest rates constrain the effectiveness of monetary policy and
  may warrant more supportive fiscal policies. More generally, macroeconomic policies should
  remain accommodative until evidence of capacity constraints in production emerge and inflation
  is on a clear upward trend. Striking an appropriate balance between fiscal adjustment policies,
  measures to reduce vulnerabilities, and growth-oriented reforms aimed at building human
  capital and physical infrastructure will be challenging for some emerging markets and developing
  economies. Policies that boost domestic sources of long-term growth—especially long-term
  investment and productivity—are a priority for all emerging markets and developing economies.
  Investing in human and physical capital will help narrow gaps in skills and infrastructure. Efforts
  to further international integration—for example, by supporting growth in emerging markets
  and developing economies services trade—and create an environment to maximize the benefits
  of foreign direct investment (FDI) could reinforce these policies.

     Box 2	 Trends in the manufacturing sector

           The manufacturing sector’s growth rate increased from 5.7 percent in 2015 to 7.0 percent
           in 2016. The production of consumer and capital goods drove manufacturing growth in 2016
           (Figure 5).12 Optimistic consumer sentiment, combined with positive employment dynamics and
           real income growth, increased demand for consumer goods. Food and beverages remained the
           country’s top manufactures, accounting for about 40 percent of total manufacturing production
           and contributing 3.3 percentage points to annual growth in 2016. Meanwhile, capital-goods
           manufacturing was also strong, with double-digit growth recorded in the production of basic
           metals, transport equipment, machinery, and electrical and non-electrical equipment. The
           production of intermediate goods, which feeds into the country’s exports, moderated from a
           strong annual growth rate of 12.0 percent in 2015 to a rate of 2.9 percent in 2016.

           The Volume of Production Index (VoPI) for manufacturing has risen steadily in recent years,
           indicating that output growth is likely to remain robust over the near term. The VoPI rose by 23.0
           percent year-on-year in December 2016, compared to 5.0 percent in December 2015 (Figure
           6), reflecting robust manufacturing activity since August 2015. The growth of key commodity

  	         Manufactured goods are classified as consumer, capital, or intermediate goods under the classification system used by the National Economic and

            goods include basic metals, fabricated metal products, and machinery, except electrical machinery and transport equipment. Intermediate goods
            include textiles, wood and wood products, paper and paper products, printing, leather products, rubber and plastic products, chemical products,
            petroleum products, and non-metallic mineral products. The World Bank classifies radio, television, and communication equipment and devices
            as intermediate goods.

              subsectors, such as food and petroleum products, as well as fabricated metals, machinery, and
              transport equipment, continued to drive the sector’s strong performance through January 2016.
              Meanwhile, the Nikkei ASEAN Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), an alternative
              indicator that measures factory activities, for the Philippines13 expanded throughout 2016,
              though its growth slowed during the last quarter of the year. In February, however, the index
              increased again, signaling renewed optimism.

              The average capacity-utilization rate continues to rise, underscoring the importance of
              expanding production capacity. The average capacity-utilization rate rose from 83.5 percent in
              December 2015 to 83.9 percent in December 2016—the tenth consecutive monthly increase
              since February 2016 and consistent with a general rising trend observed since 2015. The rate
              moderated slightly to 83.8 in January 2017. Eleven of the country’s 20 major industries are now
              operating at or above 80 percent capacity utilization, which effectively constitutes full capacity.
              As a result, investments in new production capacity will be critical to ensure continued medium-
              term output growth.

    context of a volatile foreign-exchange market.                                                               US$50.00 mark as investors priced-in the prospect

                   The currency depreciation was largely a regional phenomenon, with currencies in neighboring economies such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore,
                   and Thailand also weakening in November.

 Box 3	 Net FDI and foreign portfolio investment flows to the Philippines

        While net FDI inflows to the Philippines have risen consistently in recent years, they remain
        relatively low by the standards of comparable countries in Southeast Asia. Net FDI inflows to
        the Philippines reached US$7.9 billion in 2016, a 40.7 percent year-on-year increase from 2015
        and the highest level of net inflows recorded in the country’s history (Figure 9). A substantial
        portion of the FDI represents intercompany borrowing in the form of debt securities or supplier
        credits, followed by the infusion of fresh equity and the reinvestment of earnings. In 2016, FDI
        to the Philippines originated primarily from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States, and
        Taiwan, and it largely supported the financial and insurance, real estate and construction, and
        manufacturing sectors. Net FDI inflows in the Philippines have historically lagged those of other
        Southeast Asian countries. In 2015, net FDI in the Philippines reached US$5.8 billion, compared
        to US$9.0 billion in Thailand, US$11.0 billion in Malaysia, US$11.8 billion in Vietnam, US$20.2
        billion in Indonesia, and US$65.3 billion in Singapore. In 2016, net FDI inflows to the Philippines
        surpassed those of Thailand (US$3.3 billion) and Indonesia (US$3.8 billion) but remained below
        those of Malaysia (US$12.6 billion) and Singapore (US$61.6 billion).

        Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investments registered by the Central Bank of the Philippines
        (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, BSP) experienced a modest recovery in 2016 after recording net
        outflows in 2014-2015. Foreign portfolio investments typically take the form of stocks, bonds,
        and money-market instruments, which are domestically and internationally tradable. The net
        outflow of BSP-registered foreign portfolio investment in 2014 and 2015 reflected anemic
        demand for government securities and net outflows from the stock market, respectively (Figure
        10). However, in 2016, foreign portfolio investment in the Philippines yielded a net inflow of
        US$404.4 million, compared to a net outflow of US$599.7 million in 2015. Foreign demand for
        government securities, term deposits, and peso-denominated debt instruments rebounded last
        year as the stock market weakened. Top investor countries included the United Kingdom, the
        United States, Singapore, Luxembourg, and Hong Kong.

          Box 4	 Recent trends in remittances

           Remittance growth accelerated in 2016, following two consecutive years of slowing growth.
           The growth rate of personal remittances rose from 3.8 percent in 2015 to 4.9 percent year-on-
           year in 2016, well above the BSP forecast of 4.0 percent (Figure 11). Overall, remittances have
           grown at an annual average rate of 6.6 percent since 2010. Remittance growth has remained
           solid despite several adverse trends, including a slower-than-expected global economic recovery
           and the continued “de-risking”17 by commercial banks, which have increased transaction costs
           for remittance transfers.

           The sources of remittance inflows largely reflect the distribution of Filipinos abroad. The United
           States remained the primary source of remittance inflows to the Philippines in 2016 (Figure 12),
           accounting for more than a third of cash remittances. However, these figures may be overstated
           due to data limitations.18 The Middle East was the second-largest source of remittances,
           accounting for 31.0 percent of cash remittances, followed by Asia (20.2 percent) and Europe
           (15.6 percent). The sources of cash remittances largely reflect the overseas distribution of more
           than 10 million Filipino migrants, the majority of whom are located in the U.S. (35.8 percent),
           followed by the Middle East (25.2 percent), Asia (16.9 percent), and Europe (8.8 percent).19

            De-risking refers to the process of closing money-transfer operators’ bank accounts due to money-laundering risks. Many international banks have
            closed the correspondent bank accounts of money-transfer operators, disrupting remittance flows.
      	
     18
            Remittance flows attributed to the United States may be overestimated since remittances are typically transferred through correspondent banks,
            most of which are in the United States. In addition, remittances sent through money-transfer operators cannot be disaggregated by source country
            and are recorded under the country where the main office is located, which is usually in the United States. (Source: BSP)

            Data are based on the latest available stock estimates of overseas Filipinos (both temporary and permanent) as of December 2013 from the
            Commission on Filipinos Overseas. 2015 United Nations Population Division data reflect similar trends, but account only for permanent migrants
            (there are an estimated 5.1 million international migrants from the Philippines).

      Box 5	 The growth of salary loans

       The BSP has sought to monitor the utilization of salary loans, which are the fastest-growing
       loan segment in many banks due to their low perceived risk. Under Circular 837, the BSP
       amended the reporting package associated with salary loans in 2014. Whereas previously only
       credit card and auto loans were reported as separate line items, salary loans are now separately
       reported under the “loans to individuals for consumption purposes” sub-category. This reform
       was designed to promote consumer lending under fair and sound credit practices. Moreover,
       salary loans were renamed “salary-based general-purpose consumption loans” (SBGPCLs) in
       2015 and were redefined to cover unsecured loans for a broad range of consumption purposes,
       granted to individuals who have a regular salary, pension, or other fixed income source. The
       current definition also covers credit issued for education, hospitalization, emergency, travel,
       household use, and other personal consumption needs.

       The accelerating growth of salary loans has drawn attention to the share of total consumer
       NPLs. As of December 2016, SBGPCLs in the Philippines amounted to PHP165.1 billion, a 36.4
       percent year-on-year increase from their December 2015 level. Since December 2014, the total
       value of SBGPCLs has grown at an annualized rate of 50.1 percent. This increase appears to be
       due to the use of credit to smooth consumption, given the slower growth of net disposable
       income. Based on the latest PSA data, the pace of net disposable income growth slowed from 9.2
       percent in 2014 to 6.1 percent in 2015. Since repayment is tied to monthly employee earnings,
       salary loans are generally perceived as low risk. As of December 2016, the ratio of nonperforming
       SBGPCLs to total SBGPCLs stood at 3.7 percent—slightly lower than the 3.9 percent reported in
       December 2015.

Accelerated public infrastructure spending led to double-digit expenditure growth in 2016 while total
revenue growth slowed, resulting in the fiscal deficit more than doubling.

      This increase in infrastructure spending can be attributed to a number of projects implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways,
      including regular maintenance and upgrading of national roads, the Department of National Defense–Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization
      program, and various capital outlay projects (e.g., the construction and rehabilitation of state universities and colleges and health facilities).
 	
24
      These reforms include the government’s “24/7 construction” program, which aims to fast track the construction of public infrastructure projects, as
      well as strengthening of project monitoring processes through geo-tagging and modernization of the government’s information-technology systems.

            In 2015, the government initiated the transfer of the Coco Levy Fund to the Bureau of the Treasury through Executive Order 179. The fund includes
            PHP62.5 billion in cash and PHP12.8 billion in government securities. See: http://pcgg.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accomplishment-

            The Philippines’ Department of Finance (DOF) attributes the increase in BIR collections, which accounted for nearly 80 percent of total tax revenue,
            to the streamlining of BIR processes, which has improved both tax collection and monitoring efficiency. The BIR has implemented several policies
            that have reduced the burden of tax compliance, including reduced documentary requirements for one-time transactions, reduced processing times
            and the release of tax clearances within two days of submitting complete documents, and strict compliance with the BIR’s prescribed timelines for
            taking action on taxpayer applications and requests. The BIR has also improved monitoring of workflow processes in the agency’s offices. See: http://

            This marks the seventh consecutive year in which the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio shows improvement. Over the past decade, the debt-to-GDP
            ratio declined by 19.2 percentage points, highlighting the country’s improved fiscal position which allowed the government to pursue expansionary
            fiscal policy. Moreover, the government’s external debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 14.9 percent in 2016 from 15.6 percent in 2015.

     Box 6	 The AmBisyon Natin 2040

                  On October 15, 2016, the President signed signed Executive Order No.5, adopting a long-term
                  vision for the Philippines known as AmBisyon Natin 2040.31 The country’s central planning
                  agency, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), developed the strategy,
                  which represents “the collective long-term vision and aspirations of the Filipino people for
                  themselves and for the country in the next 25 years.”32 Under NEDA’s leadership, this central
                  vision will guide development planning in the Philippines over the next four administrations
                  through each administration’s Philippine Development Plan.

                  The strategy is based on a set of household consumption and asset-ownership targets for 2040.
                  These include owning a house and a car and having enough money to send children to college
                  while maintaining a middle-class lifestyle. For a family of four, this consumption level translates
                  into an estimated gross monthly income of PHP120,000. To achieve this long-term vision, per-
                  capita income in the Philippines would need to triple over the next 25 years.

                  Achieving this ambitious long-term vision will require careful policy coordination and an
                  enduring commitment from both the public and private sectors. The government will need to
                  maintain strong macroeconomic fundamentals through sound fiscal and monetary policies while
                  promoting more inclusive growth, including by promoting competition, simplifying business
                  regulations, and ramping up investment. Finally, ensuring the success of the structural reform
                  agenda will require the buy-in of various stakeholders, including the public administration and
                  the country’s future leaders.

   	              AmBisyon Natin roughly translates to “Our Ambition.”
32
   	              The process of developing the AmBisyon Natin 2040 began in 2015 and involved focus-group discussions with some 300 citizens, as well as a national
                  survey of around 10,000 individuals. Technical studies were also prepared to identify strategic options for realizing the collective vision by 2040. An
                  advisory committee composed of government officials and representatives from the private sector, academia, and civil society provided guidance
                  throughout the process. See: http://2040.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-Long-Term-Vision-for-the-Philippines.pdf

     17.	 The government has proposed an                                                 tax and the estate tax.34 To offset the loss in
     ambitious tax-reform package to help balance                                        revenue resulting from lower tax rates, the
     planned spending increases. The government                                          government would expand the value-added tax
     submitted the Tax Reform for Acceleration                                           (VAT) base by limiting exemptions. In addition,
     and Inclusion (TRAIN) proposal to Congress in                                       the government would adjust excise taxes on
     January 2017. The package aims to redesign                                          fuel and automobiles to further offset revenue
     the tax system to be fairer, simpler, and more                                      losses. To complement these policy reforms, the
     efficient in raising the resources required to invest                               government is proposing several complementary
     in infrastructure and human capital (Box 7). It                                     tax-administration measures. The authorities
     would lower the country’s income-tax brackets                                       estimate that implementing the first package of
     and adjust tax rates to improve overall equity,                                     tax reforms would yield revenues of PHP206.8
     and it would reduce rates for both the donor’s                                      billion, or around 1.1 percent of GDP, by end-2018.

          Box 7	 The TRAIN reform package

           The initial component of the government’s tax-reform agenda involves simplifying income-tax
           brackets and restructuring both the donor’s tax and the estate tax. The reforms would reduce
           the number of income-tax brackets from seven to six and gradually lower tax rates over several
           years. Under the government’s proposed schedule (Table 3), taxpayers with incomes below
           PHP250,000 per year will be exempt from paying taxes, and marginal tax rates and base taxes
           will increase as individuals move up the proposed tax schedule. The simplified personal income-
           tax system is expected to increase net incomes for most taxpayers and improve the equity of the
           tax structure. In addition, both the donor’s tax and the estate tax will be subject to a single rate
           of 6 percent.

           The TRAIN package also includes measures to reduce leakages and improve the efficiency of
           the current tax system. The TRAIN would expand the VAT base by removing special exemptions,
           excluding those for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. In addition, excise taxes on
           petroleum, which have not been adjusted since 1997, will undergo a phased rate increase (Table
           4). Diesel fuel, which is not currently subject to excise taxes, will be subject to an excise tax of
           PHP3.0 per liter in the second half of 2017, PHP5.0 per liter in 2018, and PHP6.0 per liter by 2019.
           Meanwhile, the excise tax on gasoline and other items deemed “nonessential” will increase from
           PHP4.35 per liter in 2016 to PHP7.0 per liter in the second half of 2017, PHP9.0 in 2018, and
           PHP10.0 by 2019. Beginning in 2020, excise tax rates for both categories will be subject to annual
           indexation of 4 percent, except if Dubai crude oil exceeds US$100 per barrel. Finally, excise tax

            The donor’s tax is a tax on a donation or gift. It is imposed on the gratuitous transfer of property between two or more persons who are living at the
            time of the transfer. It applies whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or
            personal, and tangible or intangible.

     Finally, various legislated reforms will be implemented to improve tax administration. The
     TRAIN proposal includes several reforms to improve tax administration by both the BIR and the
     Bureau of Customs. Proposed reforms include: (i) fuel marking by the Department of Finance
     (DOF) to prevent smuggling; (ii) requiring that electronic receipts be simultaneously issued to the
     purchaser and transmitted to the BIR; (iii) mandatory connection of the point-of-sale system to
     the BIR; and (iv) the relaxation of bank secrecy laws to combat tax fraud.


1.5 Employment and Poverty: More Inclusive Growth

Sustained economic growth has led to gains in employment creation and poverty reduction. A net
total of 1.4 million jobs were created in 2016, driving the unemployment rate to a historic low of 4.7
percent. Over the past three years millions of people escaped extreme poverty.

           poverty-measurement        methodology.         The
           national survey is conducted using face-to-
           face interviews of sample households randomly drawn from Metro Manila, the rest of Luzon (also
           referred to as “balance Luzon”), Visayas, and Mindanao. The survey uses two questionnaires for adult
           respondents aged 18 years and older. Respondents are first asked where they place themselves on the
           scale of “not poor,” “on the line,” or “poor.” If the respondents indicate that they consider themselves
           poor, they are subsequently asked the amount of money they would need for home expenses each
           month in order not to be poor. The household questionnaire, which is administered to the household
           head, contains information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the household, as well as
           poverty and hunger perceptions. Additional questions are sometimes commissioned to address
           other socially relevant topics such as governance, politics, and economics.

           Self-rated poverty assessments rely on a household’s perception of its circumstances at the time of
           the survey. Respondents provide a minimum household budget as their subjective poverty threshold.
           The median poverty threshold in Metro Manila in December 2016 was PHP18,000, while balance
           Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao registered a lower threshold of PHP10,000. These self-reported
           thresholds are not significantly different from the poverty thresholds used in official statistics. The
           equivalent official poverty thresholds for an average household of five in 2016 was PHP18,755 in
           Metro Manila, PHP11,085 in balance Luzon, PHP10,749 in Visayas, and PHP10,896 in Mindanao.
           However, self-rated poverty estimates are significantly and consistently higher than official statistics
           based on objective welfare measures. Studies have shown that while objective welfare measures,
           such as income and expenditures, affect subjective perceptions, underlying psychological factors
           based on the respondent’s characteristics (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic, or health status) are
           also important.37

20        PhilippineS ECONOMIC UPDATE • April 2017
Part II:

Outlook and Risks
In the near term, favorable macroeconomic conditions are expected to support robust growth in the
Philippines. The economy is projected to expand at a rate of 6.9 percent in 2017 and 2018. High levels of
consumer and business confidence and the government’s strong policy commitment to increased public
infrastructure spending are the foundation for the positive baseline outlook. Poverty reduction is projected to
accelerate under the baseline growth forecast, as growth is expected to remain inclusive. The extreme poverty
rate (measured by the World Bank’s international poverty line of US$1.90/day in 2011 PPP terms) is projected
to fall from 5.8 percent in 2016 to 5.1 percent in 2017. The continuous movement of the labor force from
agriculture to more productive sectors, combined with a gradual improvement in agricultural productivity
and more effective and efficient public and private transfers are expected to drive poverty alleviation
and promote shared prosperity. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals will provide some space for the
government to implement its public-spending and social-investment agenda, but fiscal risks are rising. While
monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, a gradual tightening is likely if inflationary pressures
continue to mount. The government has made progress in outlining its ambitious infrastructure agenda,
including projects to be executed through public-private partnerships, but implementation bottlenecks
persist and fiscal sustainability concerns may temper the pace of public capital spending. Over the long term,
the Philippines will be well-positioned to take advantage of critical development opportunities, including a
potential demographic dividend and a rapidly expanding services sector.

22        PhilippineS ECONOMIC UPDATE • April 2017
II. Outlook and Risks

     Box 9	 The global economic outlook

      Global economic growth is projected to rebound in 2017, driven by the recovery of emerging
      market and developing economies. The pace of global growth is projected to accelerate from an
      estimated 2.3 percent in 2016 to 2.7 percent year-on-year in 2017 (Table 6). Emerging market and
      developing economies are expected to account for about 60 percent of global growth in 2017. The
      aggregate growth rate for emerging market and developing economies is projected to rise from
      3.4 percent in 2016 to 4.2 percent year-on-year in 2017, aided by a modest expected recovery
      in commodity prices and solid growth among commodity importers. Global growth is projected
      to increase slowly to 2.9 percent year-on-year at by the end of the forecast period, fueled by the
      sustained growth of emerging market and developing economies anticipated until 2019.

      Several downside risks threaten global growth prospects. Heightened levels of policy
      uncertainty, most notably regarding global trade, financial market disruptions due to tightening
      global financing conditions, and slower potential growth among major economies, are key risks
      which could derail the potential global economic recovery. The potential for a fiscal stimulus in
      other countries represents an upside risk.

      The expected increase in global interest rates could result in sharp swings in both borrowing
      costs and exchange rates in emerging market and developing economies if market expectations
      adjust abruptly. Long-term interest rates in the United States remain low, but have started
      to increase amid the ongoing normalization of U.S. monetary policy and rising inflationary
      expectations.40 An increase in yields driven by a reassessment of monetary policy expectations
      could have large adverse effects on financial markets and capital flows in emerging market
      and developing economies.41 Higher interest rates make U.S. debt more attractive, and could
      lead to capital flows back to the United States. This in turn could lead to an appreciation of
      the U.S. dollar, which could raise debt-servicing costs and credit risks among emerging market
      and developing economies.42 Although the share of both private and public debt denominated
      in foreign currency has declined, several countries with elevated short-term foreign-currency-
      denominated debt and weak or deteriorating current-account positions are vulnerable to rollover
      and interest-rate risks, as well as to a drying up of foreign-exchange liquidity.43

     Box 10	 Global trade and protectionism

      Global trade is expected to recover in 2017-2018, but its growth rate is expected to remain
      below its long-term average due to a less favorable policy environment. Import demand is
      projected to rebound among large emerging market and developing economies, as well as among
      advanced economies, which are expected to see modest gains in 2017-2019 (Figure 25). However,
      the pace of the recovery is expected to be slower than anticipated due to persistent weakness
      in global investment (Figure 26) and delayed trade liberalization as a result of uncertain U.S. and
      European trade policy priorities. The recent slowdown in global investment may dampen trade
      prospects as capital goods account for about one-third of global goods trade. Meanwhile, the
      new U.S. administration’s more inward-looking policy stance, combined with the U.K.’s decision
      to leave the European Union, could make the global trade policy environment less favorable.

      Trade in services is expected to be more resilient than trade in goods, as the former does
      not entail fixed storage costs and is therefore less sensitive to changes in credit and trade-
      financing conditions.49 Services account for about two-thirds of global economic output and
      over 50 percent of output in most emerging market and developing economies. However, trade
      in services is very sensitive to barriers to entry, local-content requirements, restrictions on the
      movement of professionals, and regulatory discrimination in business licensing.

              Increased protectionism and the possible undoing of existing trade agreements could greatly
              exacerbate welfare losses in emerging market and developing economies. Protectionist policies
              appear to be gaining traction worldwide, with new trade restrictions reaching a post-crisis high
              in 2016.50 Among advanced economies, measures such as anti-dumping laws, countervailing
              duties, and safeguards have been the most commonly used instruments, while emerging market
              and developing economies have used a broader set of restrictive measures, including import
              tariffs and export taxes. Even within the parameters of current international standards, WTO
              members could legally triple import tariffs, which would entail a 10 percent drop in world
              trade from the baseline and large welfare losses for the global economy.51 These losses would
              disproportionately affect the poorest emerging market and developing economies, which rely on
              trade as a key engine for growth and development.52

       	        The manufacturing sector has been steadily expanding since 2009 and its contribution to growth has been marginally higher in the post crisis period,
                averaging 1.7 percent since 2010, compared to 0.8 percent from 2000 to 2009. The volume of the production index in manufacturing has sustained
                growth for 18 consecutive months since mid-2015. While the average capacity utilization rate reached 83.9 in December 2016, investment in durable
                equipment to support manufacturing is rising. However, only a third of this investment is on general and specialized machinery, indicating additional
                scope for new investment.

       Quantitative restrictions on rice imports have been in place since 1995. The WTO permitted the Philippines to impose a 10-year rice QR system,
       which was extended in 2004 and extended once more in 2014 for three years. The QR caps the volume of private rice imports at 805,200 metric
       tons and establishes a rice tariff of 35 percent. The administration’s economic team plans to lift the QR to increase the sector’s competitiveness and
       attract more private-sector participation. However, the Department of Agriculture prefers a grace period of two additional years to give farmers more
       time to adjust to the flooding of imports.

   The PDP 2017-2022 is founded on the pillars of Malasakit, Pagbabago, and Patuloy na Pag-
   unlad, roughly translated as “Care, Change, and Continued Progress.” Under the first pillar
   (Malasakit), the government aims to reinforce citizen trust in public institutions. Strategies under
   this pillar include promoting transparency within the government, improving the efficiency of the
   public sector, and pursuing regulatory reforms. Under the second pillar of Pagbabago, or what
   the PDP refers to as inequality reducing transformation, the PDP aims to increase opportunities
   for output growth and income generation and improve access to human capital. Strategies under
   this pillar focus on enhancing access to quality basic education for all Filipinos, and increasing
   opportunities within the global market by streamlining bureaucratic processes for local and foreign
   businesses. Under the third pillar of Patuloy na Pag-unlad, the government aims to increase the
   Philippine economy’s growth potential by maximizing the country’s potential demographic dividend
   and advancing science, technology, and innovation. Strategies under this pillar include maintaining
   macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial stability as the country undertakes critical tax reforms.

   NEDA is tasked with working with different government agencies to ensure the PDP’s successful
   implementation. After the NEDA board approves the PDP 2017-2022, NEDA will formulate an
   Executive Order requiring that all government agencies support the PDP. To ensure the PDP’s
   successful implementation, NEDA will work with various national-level government agencies to
   prioritize policies and programs identified in the PDP.

The Philippine economy has grown at a robust pace in recent years, yet problematic trends have emerged
in key areas of trade competitiveness, global value chain integration, and product-space evolution. The
Philippines has increasingly focused on the export of intermediate products, extending its economic distance
from the final consumer. In the process, Philippine firms have become less able to influence global value
chains and have failed to penetrate new markets. As a result, the Philippines has lost some elements of global
value chains to regional competitors, reorienting production toward less sophisticated goods and services,
and its economy is now more exposed to global demand fluctuations. Furthermore, the diversification of
the Philippine export basket has concentrated on primary commodities, natural resources, and other goods
at the periphery rather than the center of the product and service space. The Philippines has also shifted
focus away from its traditional comparative advantage in sophisticated products, making future value-
chain upgrading and innovation at the center of the product and service space even more difficult. Most
importantly, while the expansion of services, and especially business-process outsourcing, has driven
recent growth in the Philippines, linkages between the services sector and more traditional activities such
as manufacturing have remained tenuous and underdeveloped. The Philippines could better maximize the
benefits of global connectivity and leverage the growth of the services sector to increase domestic value
addition and accelerate the creation.

level. However, per capita GDP in the Philippines
is low relative to the sophistication of its exports
(Figure 40), suggesting that the Philippines is
not leveraging the full benefit of its participation
in international trade and GVCs. This could be
explained by the position of the Philippines in the
value chain: while the end product is high-tech, the
tasks performed in the Philippines are fairly basic
(assembly of components), adding little value.

     The product space quantifies the relatedness of products with a measure called “proximity”. Proximity formalizes the intuitive idea that a country’s
     ability to produce a product depends on its ability to produce other products. For example, a country that exports apples probably has the necessary
     conditions, equipment, and regulations in place to relatively easily begin exporting pears, e.g. the appropriate soil and climate, packing equipment,
     refrigerated trucks, agronomists, phytosanitary laws, and working trade agreements. These inputs would not be useful, however, in producing a
     dissimilar product such as copper wire or home appliances.

                                            Annex 1: Philippine Export Basket


     Over the past 20 years, the Philippines’ basket of exports has undergone two phases of evolution
     in volumes/values. During the first period from 1995 to 2005, the Philippines shifted its production
     and exports from textiles, agri-food, and other natural resources to electronics and electrical products
     (Figure 51). Electronics and electrical products represented up to 74 percent of exports in 2005,
     compared to 45 percent in 1995. During the second period from 2005 to 2015, electronics exports
     declined, though they still represented 60 percent of total exports in 2014, and resource-based
     exports increased, with metals and minerals representing 12 percent of exports in 2014. (Figure 52)

                                             Annex 2: Identifying Prime Areas for Diversification


The Philippine government could better target its interventions and support innovations in industries
with a higher chance of success. Figure 53 identifies export diversification opportunities in the
Philippines based on the proximity of existing non-competitive and competitive exports and market
trends. It shows the products most similar to the ones the Philippines currently successfully exports,
which depend on similar technologies and inputs, and which enjoy growing market demand. The
products are ranked by their distance from existing competitive exports. The color of the bars reflects
the size of the complexity gap, with darker blue bars indicating greater complexity. The length of the
bars shows export performance, and the black lines denote global growth rates for each type of product.
Products for which the blue bar does not cross the black line represent opportunities for diversification.

     the lines measures the proximity of non-competitive and competitive exports (the thicker the line,
     the closer the products are in the product space), while the color measures the complexity range
     (darker colors reflect greater complexity). Prime areas for diversification, with high proximity and low
     complexity levels, include “electro-magnets and parts of magnetic devices” and “electrical starts of
     machinery and apparatus.”

                    Annex 3: Applying the Concept of Eco²zones to the Philippines


Investment incentives should focus on qualitative rather than quantitative dimensions. From the
perspective of countries willing to attract FDI and actively participate in global production and trade
(GVCs), it is about ending a race to the bottom for FDI attraction, becoming more selective, and
rewarding investors with the largest development footprint, i.e. investors who contribute most to the
socioeconomic upgrading of the country through intra-value chain transfers of all kinds, ranging from
access to finance and technology to knowhow and skills. It is also an acknowledgment of the limits
of the old SEZ model that based attractiveness on production costs (low wages and taxes) and could
have little or limited impact on the domestic economy, sometimes creating a dual economy to the
detriment of domestic forward and backward linkages. Recent surveys and analyses show that the
main reason driving a lead firm’s decision to include (or not) a specific country in its GVC is its local
firms’ (mainly SMEs) ability to meet its production standards.77

Attracting the right investors, creating the right incentives, and maximizing the development impact
of GVC participation begins with increased transparency about production methods. Sustainability
reporting can reduce firm liability along GVCs, allowing products to be more easily traced and risks to
be more effectively mitigated along the value chain. This would be a first but important step towards
more inclusive and sustainable GVCs. SSEZs or Eco²zones would serve as safe production areas for lead
firms. Local firms in the zones would be required to fill sustainability reports with support from the
government, donors, NGOs, and lead firms. The zones would help attract investors that are conscious
of development issues and willing to reduce sustainability risks along GVCs. However, the zones should
be conceived in such a way so as not to affect the competitiveness of SMEs. The Philippine model
addresses this by assigning Eco²zone status to firms themselves rather than to geographic areas.

The development of Sustainable Special Economic Zones (SSEZs), or Eco²zones, was facilitated by a
shift in the trade and investment paradigm. The globalization of value chains has increased the risk
of non-compliance with corporate social responsibility principles and environmental, labor, health,
and safety standards. Companies headquartered in the US and the EU are now liable for risks all
along their value chains, and they must respond to allegations that their subsidiaries are engaging in
prohibited practices, such as the use of child labor. As a result, firms are increasingly seeking increased
transparency along value chains to reduce their liability and ensure the quality of end products.

Eco²zones represent a large share of exports in the Philippines. The Eco²zones could help to promote
more equitable and sustainable GVCs. SME training, the development of tailored reporting instruments,
and the diffusion of information and materials could build on existing Negosio centers. Given the
innovative character of this approach, one could also invest in the promotion of a national “risk-
free GVC” brand and concepts of SSEZs or Eco²zones. This would be an integral part of the country’s
strategy to attract the right investors and create more and better jobs through GVC integration.

The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs’ Corporate Sustainability and Reporting for
Competitive Business program, which was launched in partnership with the Global Reporting
Initiative in Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam, aims to improve
sustainability reporting and enhance the competitiveness of sustainable businesses, with a focus
on SMEs. The program seems to have been largely successful based on preliminary evaluations, and
a second phase was recently launched to build on the initiative. Among other activities, simplified
reporting questionnaires and methodologies are being developed that target the specific needs

     and capacities of SMEs. The program is currently being analyzed to assess whether SMEs that have
     complied with sustainability requirements have become more competitive and better integrated in
     GVCs, as well as the extent to which sustainability reporting has helped to link local SMEs with lead
     firms and production networks.

     Companies and investors around the world are increasingly using sustainability reporting to evaluate
     business performance. A number of countries have established laws requiring that companies report
     on non-financial activities to better assess the environmental and social impact of their business
     operations. Greater transparency should promote more sustainable business practices and help
     governments better target regulatory reforms.

     Sustainability reporting is just a first step towards more inclusive and sustainable GVCs. Increased
     transparency could help identify bottlenecks and improve the sustainability and performance of local
     firms. Programs to facilitate the upgrading process could be put in place with the support of the
     government, the international community, the private sector, and civil society. The World Bank and
     the IFC, in particular, are implementing a number of programs aimed at building the capacity of SMEs.
     Based on reporting, one could identify the best performers, the lagers, the gaps (e.g. absence of
     answers on a dimension like gender or health), etc. and put in place the adequate support.
