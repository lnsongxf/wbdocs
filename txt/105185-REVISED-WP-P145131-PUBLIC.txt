Foreword


The Bank of Papua New Guinea and the World Bank are glad to present the initial
findings from the first national survey of financial capacity among PNG population.

Financial capability refers to the capacity to effectively manage financial sources
over the life cycle and engage constructively with financial products and services. It
is recognized as an essential skill for individuals in all walks of life and has become a
public policy concern throughout the world from advanced economies to developing
countries. It is a new challenge to individuals and households in low and middle-
income economies where the traditional forms of family and community support
are being replaced or blended gradually with formal social protection programs with
innovative products and services. Traditional ways of doing business are also changing
to cope with increasing competition at local, national and global levels. Understanding
financial matters and making informed financial decisions among citizens will
contribute to overall financial stability of a country as evidenced by the recent global
financial crisis.

Understanding the financial capability of PNG population is of particular relevance
to policy makers, educators and researchers in PNG as we all know anecdotally that
level of financial exclusion is high in PNG and the ability of many Papua New Guineans
to manage money is limited as formal financial services are a rather new concept
to the traditional communities in PNG. Increasing our knowledge and understanding
is particularly important as the formal financial system continues to develop rapidly
in PNG and households, whether urban or rural, are required to use an increasing
number of financial instruments and to manage increasingly complex household
finances.

This National Financial Capability Survey aims to provide a detailed picture which can
support policy and programmes to enhance financial inclusion and increase financial
literacy of all Papua New Guineans. The initial findings from the surveys in Madang and
Morobe provinces already provide a set of rich data that can be further analysed. Once
completed the National Financial Capability study will provide a baseline measure of
financial inclusion and financial capability for PNG.

We would like to encourage sharing of key findings of this report among policy
makers, researchers, educators and financial services providers so as to support the

                                   Both the Government and BPNG are committed to increasing financial inclusion and

                                   and enhancing financial literacy by incorporating the financial inclusion agenda in key
                                                                              1

                                   international best practices in financial inclusion program design and implementation.

Executive Summary


Objective of the Report
The study of financial inclusion and financial capability in Morobe and Madang
provinces is the first population level study of financial inclusion and financial
capability in Papua New Guinea. This report is an initial report of the national study of
financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG.

The objective of this report is to examine levels of financial inclusion of adults who
make financial decisions on behalf of their households across the key financial product
groups of savings, long term savings, and credit and protection products. The report
also examines the financial capability of adults who make financial decisions on behalf
of their households, particularly in respect to those aspects of financial behaviour
which impact the management of household cash flows. The report has examined
financial inclusion and financial capability for both women and men who make
financial decisions on behalf of their household.

Knowledge of levels of financial inclusion and related understanding of financial
capability is currently very low in Papua New Guinea. Increasing our knowledge and
understanding is particularly important as the formal financial system continues to
develop rapidly in PNG and households, whether urban or rural, are required to use a
broad array of financial instruments, manage complex household finances within an
extended planning horizon which, increasingly, encompasses the need to provide for
retirement.

The report makes a significant contribution to increasing understanding and, whilst
limited in geographic scope to Morobe and Madang provinces, provides an important
input to the further development of financial inclusion and financial literacy strategy in
Papua New Guinea.

The study has been undertaken by the Bank of Papua New Guinea; field work was
undertaken by the Papua New Guinea Institute for National Affairs, with the support
of the National Statistics Office. Technical assistance was provided by the World
Bank. The study was funded by the Korean Poverty Reduction and Socio-Economic
Development Trust Fund II.

                                   Structure of the Report
                                   The report is structured in six chapters.

                                   Chapter 1 discusses the background to the study. The concepts of financial
                                   inclusion and financial capability are briefly discussed. Following this, the
                                   development of the survey (within the context of the development of the global
                                   World Bank Financial Capability survey instrument) is overviewed. The study
                                   objectives, instrumentation, methodology, sampling and field-work are also briefly
                                   discussed.

                                   Chapter 2 discusses financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG generally.
                                   Increasing levels of financial inclusion and enhancing the financial capability of the
                                   population are key strategic objectives of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and policy
                                   objectives for the government of Papua New Guinea. The retail financial services
                                   landscape in PNG is briefly overviewed.

                                   Chapter 3 provides an overview of Morobe and Madang. Financial inclusion
                                   and financial behaviour do not stand alone but are a function of the economic
                                   environment, the infrastructure and public services and the education environment.
                                   Morobe and Madang provinces in some ways entail a microcosm of many of the
                                   diverse geographical and social characteristics of Papua New Guinea. Whilst it is
                                   impossible for any province to represent the entire country’s range of physical and
                                   human characteristics, Morobe and Madang do reflect some of that diversity and the
                                   related challenges facing the extension of formal financial services in PNG. The current
                                   financial services environment in Morobe and Madang is overviewed.

                                   Chapter 4 examines financial inclusion in Morobe and Madang. The chapter
                                   commences with an examination of two facilitators of financial inclusion: confidence
                                   in communicating in English and access to and use of a mobile phone. The use of
                                   formal financial services is examined across the key product groups of payment
                                   services, savings, long term savings (including provident and superannuation), credit
                                   and protection (insurance) products. Barriers to the use of financial services are
                                   examined, in particular access barriers, gender and affordability. The use of informal
                                   financial services is examined.

                                   Chapter 5 examines financial capability in Morobe and Madang. Five aspects of
                                   financial capability are explored. The chapter commences with an examination of the
                                   management of current household cash-flows, from the perspective of both planning
                                   and budgeting cash-flows and the management of flows. Planning future household
                                   cash-flows is then examined. Three aspects of future cash-flow management are
                                   explored: the planning for major future expenditure, planning for the future of children
                                   in the household and planning for older age. Responsibility for household financial

management is examined. Following this the chapter examines relationships with
financial services providers and the process used to select financial products and
services and understanding of the cost of financial services. The chapter concludes
with a brief discussion of the findings from the present study relative to other financial
capability studies, in particular studies in PNG and other Pacific Island countries.

Chapter 6 discusses the policy and strategy implications of the study findings,
with a particular focus of the implications for the achievement of the Maya Declaration
goals.

The Annexes provide detailed information on the survey instruments, the sampling
methodology, an English-Tok Pisin Glossary of Financial Terms, and literature review of
financial capability measurement.



Key Findings
Financial Services Access

There is good access to formal financial services access points in urban and township
locations. Retail banking services, including ATM and EFTPOS services are available
at multiple locations in Lae and Madang and also in townships (for example Bulolo
and Finschafen). Savings and Loan and microfinance institutions also have outlets,
primarily in urban locations.

In addition to accessibility to financial services, households in urban and township
communities can access a broad range of formal financial services. A range of
payment services, savings, long term savings and investment services and credit
services (including asset finance) are offered by multiple financial services providers.
Consumers in urban locations appear to have both access and choice.

The situation in rural communities is very different. Only one bank, BSP, has a rural
agent network. The number of rural agents, relative to the rural population is, however
small. A very significant proportion of the rural population in Morobe and Madang
effectively has no, or very limited access to formal financial services. In addition, the
range of financial services available to rural communities is very limited. Products and
services are limited to those which can be offered by agents. Overall, it appears many
consumers in rural locations in Morobe and Madang have neither access to formal
financial services or a set of financial products and services from which to select an
appropriate product.


Financial Inclusion

A very high percentage of rural respondents (60–80 percent) owned no financial
products. Women were more likely to report owning no financial products than




                                                                                                       xvii

                                   men. By contrast in urban communities men reported owning on average 3.4 financial
                                   products and women 1.3. Respondents whose principal source of income was formal
                                   sector wages or salary were more likely to report financial product ownership.

                                   Payments for day-to-day purchases were made using cash, irrespective of
                                   whether or not the respondent had a bank account with debit card access.
                                   Items which were commonly paid for by electronic channels were school fees, formal
                                   loan repayments and rent/lease payments (in urban households). Most wages or
                                   salaries were typically received by credit to a bank account. By contrast payment for
                                   sales from informal activity or self-employment was almost exclusively cash based.

                                   In urban locations levels of account ownership appear to be similar to those
                                   reported by other developing countries. In rural locations, by contrast, 21 percent
                                   of men and 9 percent of women owned a savings account. There is some evidence
                                   of multiple account ownership. Twenty one percent (21 percent) of respondents who
                                   reported owning a debit card based savings account also reported owning a passbook
                                   savings account. Given the differences in the product range between banks and
                                   S&Ls/microfinance, this suggests approximately 20 percent of bank savings account
                                   customers may also have an account at another institution.

                                   Respondents who reported owning a savings account also reported money
                                   was kept safe in the account. By contrast, respondents who did not have an
                                   account reported keeping money safe by hiding it or using a locked box. Households
                                   that owned a savings account were more likely to report the household tried to save
                                   money for the future, tried to save regularly and tried to keep funds aside to provide
                                   for emergencies or unexpected expenses. Use of informal savings appears to be
                                   related to employment. Most respondents who reported having informal savings
                                   associated the product with employment.

                                   Urban respondents in formal sector employment were more likely to report
                                   long term savings, in particular provident/superannuation fund membership.
                                   Approximately 7 percent of adults reported some form of formal borrowing. This is
                                   only slightly lower than levels found in other developing countries. Men living in urban
                                   communities, whose principal source of income was formal sector wages and salaries
                                   were the most likely group to report having formal credit commitments. Levels of
                                   insurance product ownership were very low. Even in urban households only 8 percent
                                   of households reported having insurance.

                                   Rural households were significantly more likely to report informal borrowing,
                                   relative to use of formal credit, than urban households, although overall more
                                   urban households reported the use of informal credit than rural households.
                                   Reported levels of borrowing from money lenders (6 percent) were only slightly higher
                                   than levels reported in other developing countries.

Barriers to Financial Inclusion

The principal barrier to financial inclusion appears to be the limited ability
of most adults in Morobe and Madang to access financial services. Generally,
as noted above, rural communities do not have access to formal financial services.
Overall, the further the household is from an urban area the more likely the household
is to be financially excluded.

Women appear to be significantly more likely to be financially excluded than
men, particularly women living in urban communities. Globally 58 percent of
women report owning an account, compared to 65 percent of men, a seven percentage
point difference. As discussed, in rural communities levels of account ownership are
very low for both men and women. In urban communities 38 percent of women and 68
percent of men reported owning an account, a thirty percentage point difference.

Most urban respondents, in particular men, were confident of their ability to
communicate in English, both spoken and written communication. By contrast
most rural respondents, in particular women, stated they could not communicate in
English. This may be a barrier to the informed use of financial services, given most
documents are written in English.

There is a very significant difference in mobile phone ownership or access, and
usage, between urban and rural communities. Rural women in particular appear to
be at a significant disadvantage in respect to the opportunity to use a mobile phone
for financial services. Without further development of mobile phone access and the
capability to text, the opportunity to use the mobile phone as a primary channel for
retail savings and transaction services may be limited, at least in some rural areas.


Financial Capability
Cash Flow Management

Most households do not plan or budget but prioritise major expenditure items.
Whilst most households reported planning how income would be used, households
also reported most plans and budgets were general, covering only major items, and
were not written down or usually adhered to.

Slightly over half of households reported having left-over money after meeting
household expenses at least some of the time. Households reported saving cash
surpluses to cover unforeseen expenses or to pay for food or other necessary items. By
contrast 80–90 percent of households reported running short of money after meeting
household expenses. Cash flow shortfalls were funded by borrowing from family or
friends (in urban households money was also borrowed from informal money lenders
or an employer), selling something (in rural households) or simply going without.

                                   Longer Term Financial Planning

                                   Many households appear to plan their income cycle. A significant number of
                                   households also reported planning at least six months ahead. Seventy percent
                                   (70 percent) of households stated they would not be able to cover a major unexpected
                                   expense (equivalent to approximately one month’s income) without borrowing. Most
                                   households reported planning for their children’s future. Households typically used
                                   more than one approach to planning for the future, the common being to save money,
                                   in particular for the children’s education.

                                   Forty four (44) percent of respondents reported they had no strategy to provide
                                   for when they were no longer able to work owing to old age. Most respondents
                                   who did have a strategy reported they expected to earn income from a business.
                                   Respondents who were employed in the formal sector also cited long term savings,
                                   in particular provident or superannuation. Respondents who earned formal sector
                                   income were more likely to consider they would be able to meet expenses when they
                                   were no longer working. Less than 50 percent of those earning informal sector income
                                   or self-employed considered they would be able to meet expenses. Approximately one
                                   quarter of respondents stated they expected to receive support from family or kinship
                                   groups.


                                   Responsibility for Household Financial Management

                                   Men were significantly more likely to cite they are responsible for the
                                   management of household expenses than women. Overall, the further out
                                   the expenditure horizon, or the less certain the expenditure (for example requests
                                   for financial assistance), the more likely that respondents reported no one in the
                                   household was responsible for the management of that category of household
                                   expenditure.


                                   Financial Knowledge

                                   Urban households appear to be generally more aware and focussed on the
                                   household’s financial situation than rural households. Overall, however, most
                                   respondents stated they considered they were disciplined at managing money and
                                   only rarely or occasionally bought unnecessary items before buying necessary items
                                   or when they knew they could not afford the item.

                                   Respondents who were confident in their ability to communicate in English were more
                                   likely to search for information from a range of sources and to consider alternatives

English were significantly less likely to check terms and conditions before committing
to purchase a financial product.

Knowledge of the cost of money was very limited. Most respondents (80 percent+) did
not know how much interest had been paid on loans or received on deposits and did
not know the fees which had been paid over the previous year.




Policy Implications
Overall Implications

The findings from the study suggest that the current National Financial
Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy may need to be further developed, in
particular to facilitate significant strengthening of the rural financial services
architecture. This is a pre-condition for enhancing rural financial inclusion. The
findings also indicate significant strengthening of financial inclusion and financial
literacy programmes, in particular urban programmes, will be required in order to
increase financial inclusion by women. Levels of financial knowledge, in particular
knowledge of the cost of financial services suggest a continuing commitment is
required to further strengthen consumer protection.


Implications for the Achievement of the Maya Declaration Goals

The implications of the study findings for the achievement of the Maya Declaration
Goals are discussed within the context of each Goal:

Goal: To reach one million more unbanked low-income people in Papua New
Guinea, 50 percent of whom will be women


Situation in Morobe and Madang

Levels of financial inclusion in urban communities in Morobe and Madang provinces
may be approaching, or may be at levels found in other developing countries. Urban
households, in particular households in which the principal source of income is formal
sector wages or salary, appear to be engaging with the formal financial system across
a broad range of product groups, extending beyond savings/transaction accounts to
long term savings and formal credit. Levels of financial inclusion in rural communities,
across all product groups are, however, very low.

Women in urban communities are significantly more likely to have a bank account
than women in rural communities and may be accessing financial services indirectly
by accessing a bank account owned or controlled by a male. Relative levels of financial
exclusion by women living in urban communities are significantly higher than those
found in rural communities.

                                   Implications for Policy and Practice

                                   Urban communities have access to a range of financial service providers and financial
                                   services. However, many rural communities have, effectively, very limited or no
                                   access to formal financial services. Findings from Morobe and Madang suggest that,
                                   without major development of the rural financial services infrastructure, bringing large
                                   numbers of Papua New Guineans, who are currently financially excluded, into the
                                   formal financial system will not be possible.

                                   Unless there is a substantive change to financial inclusion products/services/
                                   programmes to bring women into the formal financial system, the goal of gender
                                   equity will probably not be achieved and the gender gap may be further
                                   exacerbated.

                                   Papua New Guineans through financial education and financial literacy


                                   Situation in Morobe and Madang

                                   Most households in Morobe and Madang try to plan and budget cash-flows. However,
                                   for most households’ plans and budgets are informal, cover major items and are not
                                   documented. Effectively most households only prioritise spending. Overall, urban
                                   households, in particular households which receive regular wages or salary, are more
                                   likely to pro-actively manage household finances than rural households.

                                   Women are less involved in all aspects of household financial management than men
                                   and have less responsibility for the management of household finances than men.

                                   Many adults, in particular rural households and women, do not know how they will
                                   fund their own and their household’s expenses when they are no longer working.


                                   Implications for Policy and Practice

                                   The focus on budgeting and planning, which is a common feature of financial literacy
                                   programmes, would appear to be appropriate. As the use of formal credit expands,
                                   inclusion of responsible borrowing modules in financial literacy programmes may also
                                   be warranted. Consideration may need to be given to including longer term savings, or
                                   asset accumulation modules, in order to increase awareness of the need to prepare
                                   for older age and how gradual longer term savings can be achieved.

                                   There is an ongoing need for financial literacy programmes specifically for women.

Situation in Morobe and Madang

Branch, ATM and EFTPOS networks in Morobe and Madang provinces are largely
urban. Agent networks do not, at this time, appear to be sufficiently dense to enable
most rural households to readily access formal financial services. However, in rural
communities, levels of mobile capability (levels of phone ownership combined with
adults’ ability to use the mobile phone) are low.


Implications for Policy and Practice

Other than BSP Rural, commercial financial services providers are not expanding
services into rural areas but are, not unexpectedly, focusing on urban communities.

It may be appropriate to consider the development of financial services delivery
architecture for rural communities in PNG. Developing extensive branch networks
in rural communities is unlikely to be economic. Technology based solutions are
likely to be a key component of a rural financial services architecture. However, the
combination of more limited ownership or access to a mobile phone and mobile
phone capability in rural communities, in particular by women, suggests that the
expansion of mobile phone-based financial services (as opposed to the use of
mobile telephony to deliver agent based financial services) in rural areas may require
concurrent capacity building.

Goal: To strengthen consumer protection by issuing prudential guidelines and
creating a platform for various national regulators and industry networks to
monitor consumer protection


Situation in Morobe and Madang

Financial services consumers appear to have a limited understanding of the cost of
the financial services they use. Many consumers, in particular consumers who are not
confident in communicating in English, do not search for information about financial
services before committing to buy a product, they do not consider alternatives or look
at alternative products and, perhaps most importantly, they frequently do not check
terms and conditions of the products they purchase.


Implications for Policy and Practice

Consumer awareness appears to be limited for many adults and there is therefore
potential vulnerability to predatory practices. Few households reported a dispute
with a financial services institution. Nevertheless a platform to monitor consumer
protection may be warranted.

                                   Financial inclusion and Capability in Papua New Guinea.




                                   Limitations of the Report and Recommendations
                                   This report is an initial output from the national financial capability study, and focuses
                                   on Morobe and Madang provinces only due to both financial and logistic constraints to
                                   conduct a national survey at this stage. The focus of the study is households. The use
                                   of financial services by formal and informal businesses has not been examined. The
                                   relationship between financial inclusion and financial capability has been examined
                                   by financial inclusion and financial capability studies in several countries using the
                                   World Bank Financial Capability Survey instrument. As the present study is an initial
                                   output from the national study, it has not sought to examine this relationship fully. It
                                   is appropriate to examine the relationship between financial inclusion and financial
                                   capability once the national survey has been completed.

                                   It is intended that the study will, in time, progress to become a nationally
                                   representative study of financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG. The sampling
                                   for the present study is representative at the combined population level for Morobe
                                   and Madang. Findings cannot be disaggregated to Morobe and Madang separately.
                                   In addition, whilst potentially indicative of likely findings from the national study, the
                                   findings from the present study cannot be interpreted as nationally representative.

                                   The report is point in time. The economic and financial landscape in PNG is evolving
                                   rapidly and regular follow up studies will be required to maintain the currency of the
                                   data.

                                   It is thus recommended that the national survey be carried out based on the learning
                                   from the regional survey done in Morobe and Madang provinces within the next two
                                   years to establish the national mapping of financial capability of PNG population. The
                                   survey instrument has been developed and tested in Tok Pisin and can be further
                                   adapted and simplified based on the feedbacks from this regional survey. The sampling
                                   methodology was established for the national survey and can be readily used for
                                   carrying out the national survey. The field implementation management was fully
                                   developed and tested and capacity of the field survey teams has been enhanced
                                   through training and on-site learning. The data collection methodology has also been
                                   piloted and tested and can be replicated for future national surveys.

1.  Background


1.1.	Introduction
This report contributes to the developing understanding of financial inclusion and
financial capability in PNG. The PNG National Financial Capability study is the first
national study of financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG and is one of a
small number of studies undertaken in PNG seeking to develop an understanding of
financial inclusion, financial knowledge and skill and financial behaviour. The present
report is an initial output from the national study, focusing on Morobe and Madang
provinces. It is intended that the study will, in time, progress to become a nationally
representative study of financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG.




1.2.	Conceptualising Financial Inclusion
     and Financial Capability
Financial Inclusion
                                                                               3
Over recent decades, financial inclusion has emerged as a global priority. Financial
inclusion is an enabler of effective, sustainable, participation in the contemporary
money economy. Financial inclusion is an issue in PNG. It is estimated that currently
in PNG up to 85 percent of the population does not have access to a bank account.
However, financial inclusion, whether in a developed or developing country context,
extends beyond basic deposit services. In a developed country context, for example,
the UK Treasury has defined financial inclusion as:

             “Access to appropriate financial services so that people can manage
             their money effectively, securely and confidently on a day-to-day
             basis; plan for the future and cope with financial distress to protect
             against short term variations in income and expenditure and take
             advantage of longer term opportunities and deal effectively with
             financial distress.” (HM Treasury, 2007, p. 25)

Financial inclusion and financial capability in morobe and madang provinces Papua New Guinea



                                   In a developing country context CGAP has defined financial inclusion as:

                                            “A state in which all working age adults, including those currently
                                            excluded by the financial system, have effective access to the
                                            following financial services provided by formal institutions: credit,
                                            savings, payments, and insurance.” (GPFI & CGAP, ND)

                                   This report examines access to, and use of, a broad range of financial products and
                                   services by households in Morobe and Madang provinces; with a particular focus
                                   on understanding location based differences and gender differences in the use of
                                   financial services.

                                   Levels of financial inclusion found in this study can be compared, at a product level,
                                   to levels of financial inclusion found in other Pacific island countries and at a product-
                                   category level, to levels of financial inclusion in other countries generally. There
                                   is considerable homogeneity of product attributes across regions. Whilst financial
                                   services fees and value-added services differ widely between countries, core product
                                   functionality is relatively consistent globally. For example, savings products, card-
                                   based transaction products, credit cards, consumer loans and term investments have
                                   broadly similar features in most countries. There is significant homogeneity of product
                                   functionality in financial products available across Pacific island countries. This is not
                                   surprising perhaps given the same group of commercial banks operate in most Pacific
                                   island countries.


                                   Financial Capability

                                   Financial capability has been defined by the World Bank as:

                                            “The (internal) capacity a person has to act in their best financial
                                                                                                          4
                                            interest, given socio-economic environmental conditions.”

                                   Financial capability encompasses the knowledge, skills, behaviours and attitudes
                                   people employ to manage their resources; their understanding of financial services;
                                   and the selection and use of financial products and services to meet their needs.
                                   Financial capability is a broader concept than financial literacy which focuses on
                                   knowledge of the financial products, financial services, financial practices and financial
                                   concepts.

                                   Financial capability can be conceptualised as spanning four domains: Base skills,
                                   financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial behaviours. The key components
                                   of each domain are shown in Figure 1.

This report examines the financial capability of adults in Morobe and Madang who
make financial decisions on behalf of their households.

Financial capability is a situated construct. For example, the financial capability
required by a subsistence farmer living in a remote rural community is likely to be
different than the financial capability required by an employee of a large corporation
living in a metropolitan environment. Required levels of literacy and numeracy are
likely to differ. The level of financial knowledge required by a person who receives a
regular salary and who has a range of borrowing will be different than that required
by a subsistence farmer whose cash income is intermittent and who has no formal
borrowing. Lifestyle differences, individual attributes and differences in the use of
financial products and related levels of required financial knowledge and skill will
impact financial attitude. The core elements of financial behaviour are, however, to
some extent constant: households engaged in the money economy need to be able
to manage current household cash-flows, plan for the future, make decisions about
financial products (whether formal or informal) and seek advice about money and
finance.

Studies of financial capability in several countries have included the construction
of a financial capability scale using factor analysis. Whilst the factors and loadings
for each individual country scale are unique, the development of a scale enables
comparison between relative levels of financial capability and financial inclusion
within jurisdictions and the comparison of levels of required financial capability across
jurisdictions.

Financial inclusion and financial capability in morobe and madang provinces Papua New Guinea



                                   The present study has not constructed an index of financial capability. There are three
                                   reasons for this:

                                   Firstly, this report is an interim report examining financial inclusion and financial
                                   capability in two provinces of the Momase Region. The national study has yet to be
                                   completed and it is therefore not possible to construct a national index.

                                   Secondly, aspects of financial capability will require further testing before being
                                   used to construct an index, in particular attitudinal variables. PNG has three official
                                   languages: Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu and English. English is the language of government
                                   and business. Hiri Motu is spoken in Papuan regions but not nationally. Tok Pisin has
                                   become widely used across PNG as a bridge across the great diversity of languages
                                   and dialects. Tok Pisin began as a trading language (‘broken English’) and continues to
                                   develop as a discrete language. However, there is, at present, no formal grammar for
                                   Tok Pisin and translating complex constructs effectively into Tok Pisin can be difficult,
                                   in particular translation of abstract concepts. Nevertheless, the study has translated
                                   attitudinal questions from the core World Bank Financial Capability instrument and
                                   responses are reported (with caution). Further testing will be required to determine
                                   the validity of including psychological/attitudinal questions in the financial capability
                                   scale.

                                   Thirdly, evidence from this study suggests the components of financial capability may
                                   differ very significantly between urban and rural communities and, therefore, it may
                                   not at this time be appropriate to develop a single national index of financial capability
                                   for PNG. Differences in levels of financial inclusion and the use of money between
                                   urban and rural communities revealed by the present study suggest it may be more
                                   appropriate, at least initially, to develop separate urban and rural indices.

                                   Several studies of financial inclusion and financial capability using the instrument
                                   developed by the World Bank administered Russia Trust Fund for Financial Literacy and
                                              5
                                   Education (the instrument used for this study) have tested respondents’ numeracy
                                   and literacy skills. It was decided not to test numeracy for the PNG National Financial
                                   Capability study. Given high levels of illiteracy, a numeracy test would need to be
                                   administered verbally and could be difficult to translate. For similar reasons, the study
                                   has not tested respondents’ knowledge of common financial concepts (for example
                                   inflation and compound interest) due to language constraints. There is, for example,
                                   no construct in Tok Pisin for ‘compound interest’. Efforts to translate into Tok Pisin
                                   resulted in the concept being explained within the question, which rather defeats the
                                   purpose of the question. Other financial capability studies which have tested literacy,
                                   have only tested comprehension rather than all aspects of literacy. Tok Pisin is a

verbal language and testing written comprehension is not appropriate (at least at this
time). Testing English comprehension would require a formal literacy test which is not
appropriate as English is not used widely in most of the households participating in the
study. Instead, given the widespread use of English in financial services documents,
respondents were asked how confident they were in communicating in English (verbal
and written) with a bank branch or a government department.

As a consequence of the foregoing, the financial behaviour of adults who make
financial decisions on behalf of their households and related levels of financial
inclusion are the principal focus of this interim report.




1.3.	Overview of the Survey
BPNG has supported three studies to increase understanding of financial inclusion
                                  6
and financial capability in PNG. The present study has its origins in the participation
by PNG in the development of a global instrument to measure financial capability.


Development of the Financial Capability Survey

In 2010 teams from eight countries (Papua New Guinea, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia,
Tanzania, Uruguay, Mexico and Colombia) met to begin the development of a global
instrument to measure financial capability. The development of the instrument was
undertaken under the auspices of the World Bank, with funding provided by the
                                                            7
Russia Trust Fund for Financial Literacy and Education.

The scope of the instrument and the instrument development methodology were
agreed at the initial meeting. Development of the instrument was completed in 2011.
The instrument was then extensively tested in the context of low and middle income
countries. The Financial Capability survey is currently used or planned to be used in
14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and East Asia and the Pacific.


PNG National Financial Capability Survey

PNG piloted the financial capability survey in 2012. It was determined the survey could
be successfully deployed in PNG, using a Tok Pisin translation, in both high income and
low income households. Preparation for the PNG National Financial Capability Survey
commenced in 2013 with funding provided by the Korean Poverty Reduction and
Socio-Economic Development Trust Fund.

Financial inclusion and financial capability in morobe and madang provinces Papua New Guinea



                                   A national sample was developed with census units selected from five provinces. Field
                                   work for the survey commenced in 2014. Due to logistic and funding constraints it was
                                   determined the survey would be deployed initially only in the Momase Region. Two
                                   provinces had been selected for field work in Momase: Morobe and Madang. Morobe
                                   is the largest and one of the most diverse provinces in PNG. Lae, the Morobe provincial
                                   capital, is an accessible central location to train enumerators. Madang province is
                                   proximate to Morobe. Momase was considered to be an appropriate region for initial
                                   survey deployment and would enable the refinement of the fieldwork methodology for
                                   subsequent rounds of data collection.

                                   The financial capability survey instrument is a global instrument and data from each
                                   country is comparable. Minor adaptation is required for individual countries (primarily
                                   in respect to financial products). Two versions of the survey were developed by the
                                   World Bank Project Team: a household version and an individual version. As the
                                   objective of the PNG study was to understand household financial inclusion and
                                   the financial capability of adults who make financial decisions on behalf of their
                                   household, the individual version of the survey was not used.

                                   Enrolment for the generic financial capability survey is based on interviewing a single
                                   respondent in each household. This approach was not used for the PNG survey as a
                                   principal focus of the surveys supported by BPNG has been to develop a gendered
                                   understanding of differences in the level of financial inclusion and financial capability.
                                   Both the woman and the man who make most financial decisions on behalf of their
                                   household were interviewed. Separate interviews were conducted.


                                   Survey Objectives

                                   The objective of the National Financial Capability survey is to develop a baseline
                                   measure of financial inclusion and financial capability for PNG. This will enable, for the
                                   first time, an accurate assessment to be made of the situation in respect to financial
                                   exclusion in PNG—not simply in respect to bank account ownership, but across the
                                   range of products: transaction, savings, long term savings and credit, commonly used
                                   by households to manage and develop household resources. This will enable the
                                   development of a financial services architecture which can facilitate reducing levels
                                   of financial exclusion. The baseline study will also enable the relationship between
                                   financial capability (or perhaps more accurately financial capabilities) and financial
                                   inclusion to be better understood. This will facilitate the development and targeting of
                                   financial literacy programmes and consumer education.

                                   The objective of the financial capability survey of Morobe and Madang has been
                                   firstly, to commence data collection for the national survey, and secondly, to provide
                                   an initial insight into levels of financial inclusion and patterns of product ownership

in urban and rural communities and by women and men, and to develop an initial
understanding of financial capability, in particular financial behaviour, to provide
input to the further development of financial inclusion and financial literacy strategy
in PNG.


Survey Instrument and Methodology

The PNG National Financial Capability Survey has used the generic financial capability
instrument developed by the World Bank Project Team. Several questions have been
added to meet local requirements, for example questions to determine respondents’
confidence with the use of English and mobile phone usage.

The survey comprises three elements:


Location Fact Questionnaire

The location fact questionnaire was administered during enrolment by interview
with a local community leader. The questionnaire collects information in respect to
the education, health and financial services available at the location, or the distance
required to travel to services (and the mode of transport commonly used to travel),
along with the source and quality of electricity and water.


Enrolment Questionnaire

The enrolment questionnaire was completed during the enrolment of the household
and comprised a household roster, information in respect to the principal dwelling
used by the household and household durables available for use by members of the
household.


Financial Capability Survey

The financial capability survey collected data covering a broad spectrum of elements
of financial capability and financial inclusion: Management of remittances and
payments, planning and management of current cash-flows and future cash-flows
(both expected and unexpected), planning for old age, planning for the future of
children living in the household, financial products and services used by the household
and how these were selected, and understanding of the cost of financial services and
relationships with financial services providers.

A standard closed question survey was used. Questions were asked in either Tok Pisin
or English (depending on the respondent’s preference). All interviewers were bilingual.
Forward and back translation was undertaken, with an independent post-translation
panel review by a reference panel of bilingual subject matter experts. Both the English




                                                                                               7

                                   and Tok Pisin versions of the survey were tested in the field. The translation was also
                                   work-shopped with the enumerators.

                                   A glossary of financial terms was developed and translated to Tok Pisin (refer to
                                   Appendix 5 for the Glossary). An added complication was the need to ensure the
                                   questions could be understood by respondents who may have limited formal
                                   education. A test of the reading age required to comprehend the survey at first
                                   reading in English (Flesch-Kincaid) indicated the survey required a comprehension
                                   level approximating that which would be achieved at the completion of primary/early
                                   secondary education. Whilst it is not possible to test the comprehension level in Tok
                                   Pisin, it was considered reasonable to assume that the level of comprehension would,
                                   in general terms, be able to be preserved in the translated version.

                                   Respondents were required to answer all (relevant) questions. Each question allowed
                                   for refusal. Interviews were conducted at a location and at a time suitable to the
                                   respondent. A female and male interviewer visited the household. Women were
                                   interviewed by women and men by men. Interviews were confidential.


                                   Sampling
                                   National Sample

                                   When fully implemented, the National Financial Capability survey will be
                                   representative of the adult population in PNG. Sample selection has been based on
                                   a stratified four-stage random sample design, with preliminary counts from the 2011
                                   Census of Population providing the sampling frame. Stratifying according to female
                                   literacy and predicted poverty, the first two stages selected 19 Districts from seven
                                   provinces, with probability proportional to estimated size. The provinces include three
                                   from the Highlands (Western Highlands, Jiwaka, Eastern Highlands), two from Momase
                                   (Madang and Morobe), and one each from the New Guinea Islands (East New Britain)
                                   and Papuan (Central) regions. Additionally, the National Capital District (NCD) is a
                                   separate survey strata.

                                   Within each District, five Census Units (CUs) were selected with probability proportional
                                   to estimated size (PPeS). Within each CU, ten households are selected by the
                                   interview teams, using circular systematic sampling. This yields an overall sample of
                                   50 households per District and 950 households in total. A further 150 households will be
                                   surveyed from the National Capital District (NCD), with a target of six households per CU,
                                   in 25 CUs that have been selected with a PPeS approach. Combining the strata, a total
                                   of 1100 households will be surveyed, and in each household an adult male and adult
                                   female will be interviewed. Since not all households will have both an adult male and an
                                   adult female, the final sample size will be less than 2200 but should be approximately
                                   the sample of 2000.

Morobe and Madang

As discussed, due to funding and logistical constraints the scope of the field work
was contracted to Morobe and Madang provinces. The census units and districts
selected for Morobe and Madang were not resampled. The selected census units
were surveyed and the completed surveys were re-weighted to reflect the completed
surveys and the revised scope. Data was collected from 8 Districts and 36 census
units (4 census units could not be accessed due to environmental conditions). Three
hundred and fifty nine (359) households from the sampled census units participated in
the survey and 688 individual surveys were completed.

Please refer to Appendix 3 for the sampling note prepared by the sampling consultant
Dr. John Gibson in respect to the national sample and the subsequent note discussing
the re-weighting for Morobe and Madang.

Field Work

Field work for the survey was undertaken by the PNG Institute for National Affairs
(INA), with support from the National Statistics Offices in Port Moresby, Lae and
Madang. Enumerators were recruited locally and were trained by the BPNG, INA and
World Bank project team members and senior NSO staff. Field work was undertaken
between July and December 2014. The Location Fact Questionnaire and the Enrolment
Questionnaire were completed using paper based survey forms. Data entry was
undertaken by INA. The Financial Capability survey was completed using off-line tablet
based data collection. The tablets were provided by BPNG and mobile phone wi-fi data
upload capacity was provided by Digicel.

     2.  Financial Inclusion and
     Financial Services in PNG


     Improving access to financial services continues to be a very significant challenge
     for PNG. There are significant barriers to increasing financial access, in particular
     operational challenges and infrastructure weaknesses which result in high provider
     costs, and the limited financial capability of clients (IMF & World Bank, 2011).




     2.1.	 Financial Inclusion in PNG
     Estimates of the number of adults who have accounts with regulated financial
     institutions vary between approximately 435,000 and 800,000 adults. ADB estimated
     approximately 15 percent of the adult population (approximately 600,000 adults) is
                                                           8
     included in the formal financial sector (ADB, 2008). The 2011 Financial Services Sector
     Assessment (IMF & World Bank, 2011) estimated between 500,000 and 800,000 people
     were included in the formal financial system. BPNG (Anderson, Kunjil, Ngodup, &
     Tongia, 2013) estimated the number of account holders at regulated financial
     institutions to be 435,316, and that approximately 7 percent of the adult population
     had at least one loan with a regulated financial institution.

     BPNG estimates the unmet demand for deposit services from the economically active
     adult population to be approximately 5.38m people (Anderson, et al., 2013) and the
     unmet demand for credit to be between 54–64 percent of the economically active
     adult population.




     2.2.	 PNG Government Commitment
           to Increasing Financial Inclusion
     Financial inclusion is a development priority for the Government of PNG. Expanding
     financial inclusion and enhancing financial literacy have been incorporated in key
     national plans: The Development Strategic Plan 2010–2030 (Department of National
     Planning and Monitoring, 2010) and Vision 2050 (National Strategic Plan Taskforce,


     8
        The present study found 15 percent of the adult population in Morobe and Madang reported
     owning a bank account.

2011). The National Informal Economy Policy (2011–2015) identified financial inclusion
as a priority action area to facilitate the development of the informal economy in
Papua New Guinea and stated increasing levels of financial inclusion should be a
major economic policy objective (DfCD & INA, 2011). 




2.3.	 Bank of Papua New Guinea Commitment
      to Increasing Financial Inclusion
      and Financial Literacy
The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has taken the lead role in increasing financial
inclusion and financial literacy in PNG. Financial inclusion is one of BPNG’s two
strategic goals (BPNG, 2011). BPNG is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion
                                                   9
(AFI) and signed the Maya Declaration in 2013, committing to seven financial inclusion
and financial literacy goals (AFI, 2013).

    1.	   To reach 1 million more unbanked low-income people in Papua New Guinea,
          50 percent of whom will be women

    2.	   To lead efforts to create a financially competent generation of Papua New
          Guineans through financial education and financial literacy

    3.	   To actively support innovative use of technology for scaling-up access to
          financial services and financial literacy

    4.	   To strengthen consumer protection by issuing prudential guidelines and
          creating a platform for various national regulators and industry networks to
          monitor consumer protection

    5.	   To begin the process of integrating financial inclusion in local and national
          government, including getting the National Executive Council to endorse the
          National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy by quarter 4 of
          2013

    6.	   To promote regular collection and use of financial access data to inform
          policy making and help identify key dimensions of financial inclusion in Papua
          New Guinea

    7.	   To optimize these results through knowledge sharing and effective
          coordination of stakeholders, including development partners, by the newly
          established Centre of Excellence for Financial Inclusion chaired by the Bank
          of Papua New Guinea.

                                   The Maya Declaration goals provide a foundation for financial inclusion and financial
                                   literacy policy and strategy. In 2013, with the support of the Pacific Financial Inclusion
                                   Programme, BPNG brought together a broad cross-section of stakeholders to identify
                                   regulatory and market conditions necessary to encourage innovation and scale in
                                                                              10
                                   financial inclusion and financial literacy. The workshop provided a key input to
                                   the development of the National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy
                                   2014–2015 (BPNG, 2013). The principal objective of the Strategy is to implement PNG’s
                                   seven commitments in the Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion. BPNG is currently
                                   implementing several key strategic action items:

                                    1.	     BPNG has sponsored and led the establishment of the Centre for Excellence
                                            in Financial Inclusion (CEFI). The primary objective of CEFI is to coordinate and
                                            monitor the implementation of the National Financial Inclusion and Financial
                                            Literacy Strategy.

                                    2.	     BPNG has supported (in conjunction with ADB) the establishment and
                                            management of the Microfinance Expansion Project (MEP). The MEP is
                                            seeking to both strengthen the supply of microfinance services and increase
                                            the demand for microfinance services.

                                    3.	     BPNG has committed to increasing financial inclusion data, in particular
                                            supply-side data.




                                   2.4.	 Retail Financial Services in PNG
                                   Financial services accessibility has significantly increased over the last two years in
                                   Papua New Guinea as a result of financial inclusion programs rolled out by the Bank of
                                   PNG in collaboration with the partner financial institutions. Financial services access
                                   points has increased from 9,257 in December 2012 to 11,015 in March 2015, an
                                   increase of 13.51 percent due to expansion of Agents, ATMs, branches, sub-branches
                                                                         11
                                   and EFTPOS by financial institutions.

                                   There are a broad range of financial services institutions providing retail financial

provide deposit and credit services to members. There has been a steady reduction
in the share of retail financial services held by S&Ls. In the 1970s there were over
120 S&Ls in PNG. There are currently 21 S&Ls. BPNG is seeking to strengthen and
support S&Ls to ensure longer term sustainability (Bakani, 2014). Legislation is being
revised to allow for the merger of S&Ls and for S&Ls to be able to borrow and access
the payments system. S&L membership will also be broadened; the current ‘common
bond’ requirement will be abolished.

There are four commercial banks in Papua New Guinea, three of which offer retail
financial services. The commercial banks are the largest providers of retail financial
services in PNG and dominate the financial sector (Conroy, 2000). Relative to other
regulated financial institutions in PNG, commercial banks have significant capacity
which spans all aspects of financial services operations and management: governance,
operational management, balance sheet and risk management, financial products and
services and financial infrastructure. Each commercial bank has developed national
distribution capacity, albeit primarily metropolitan, and offers a basic bank account
(refer to Table 1).

Whilst each of the three commercial banks has demonstrated a commitment to
savings mobilisation through the provision of deposit and transaction services to
poor and lower income customers, only one bank (BSP) has developed a branch and
agent network of sufficient reach to achieve broad based geographic penetration. No
commercial bank has developed a basic credit product targeted to financially excluded
individuals, households and informal sector participants.

                                   There are five regulated microfinance institutions in PNG. Microfinance institutions
                                   provide deposit and credit services. Only one microfinance institution, MiBank
                                   (Nationwide Microbank) has nationwide representation (12 branches). As shown in
                                   Figure 2, Microfinance outreach is highly concentrated in a small number of provinces.




                                   2.5.	Accessing Retail Financial Services
                                   Access to retail financial services in PNG is bifurcated. In urban areas consumers have
                                   a range of institutions and products and services to select from. In the townships
                                   surveyed, consumers appear to have access to formal financial services. However, this
                                   is not the case with most rural communities where the principal issue is not choice or
                                   selection, but access to any form of formal retail financial services. PNG has one of the
                                   lowest levels of access point density globally.

                                   Of the 164 countries for which data is available for 2004, PNG ranked 138th. By
                                   contrast, of the 179 countries for which data is available for 2014, PNG ranked
                                   169th. As shown in Figure 3, the average financial services branch density in PNG is
                                   1.9 branches per 100,000 adults. By contrast, globally, financial services branch density
                                                                                                13
                                   is 12.16 branches per 100,000 adults. The average branch density in lower-middle
                                   income countries is 7.8 per 100,000 adults (2004 = 5.06). In Pacific island countries
                                   (excluding PNG) the average branch density in is 18.9 branches per 100,000 adults.

20 percent and globally by 33 percent.

It appears the situation in rural areas may have exacerbated in recent years, with an
increasing concentration of branches in urban areas: ‘. . . licensed banks and savings
and loan societies have been reducing their coverage in regional and rural areas over
a period of decades’ (Conroy, 2000).


Financial Services Agents

Agents are often used to provide physical access points in locations in which it is not
economical to open a branch. As examples, Bradesco (a Brazilian bank) operates an
agent network with 24,500 locations nationwide (16.4 per 100,000 adults). In Kenya, a
                                         15
network of almost 70,000 agents services ten banks in addition to Safaricom M-PESA
                                                                                         16
(268 per 100,000 adults). Tanzania has nearly 17,000 mobile money agents (57 per
100,000 adults). There are currently 26,000 agents (across multiple financial services
                      17
providers) in Peru (118 per 100,000 adults).

There are currently approximately 771 agents in PNG providing services on behalf of
regulated financial institutions (Anderson, et al., 2013). Overall agent density is modest
(16.5 per 100,000 adults).

                                   Globally, ATM density has increased significantly over the past ten years. Global
                                                                                                                      19
                                   average ATM density (2013) has now reached 34 ATMs per 100,000 adults. Similarly,
                                   ATM density has been growing quickly in Pacific island countries, having grown from
                                   7.4 ATMs per 100,000 adults in 2004 to 22.0 ATMs per 100,000 adults in 2013. This
                                   represents a compound annual growth rate of 11.6 percent.

                                   The increase in ATM density in PNG has been slower than that of other Pacific island
                                   countries (refer to Figure 4). There are 398 ATMs deployed in PNG (BPNG, 2015). The
                                   compound annual growth rate is 8.0 percent. ATM density in PNG is 8.4 ATMs per
                                   100,000 adults (2013).

                                                                                                                            20
                                   Globally there continues to be strong growth in the number of EFTPOS terminals.
                                   There are approximately 13,500 EFTPOS terminals deployed in PNG (BPNG, 2015).
                                   There is no publically available country level data to enable a comparison of the
                                   density of EFTPOS terminals in PNG against other countries.

                                   The 2009–2010 HIES found that overall, 49.1 percent of households in PNG owned
                                   a mobile phone. A slightly lower percentage of households in rural communities
                                   reported owning a mobile phone (42.5 percent). By contrast 89.2 percent of

households in urban communities reported owning a mobile phone. Given the work
undertaken by mobile phone providers in PNG to extend rural mobile phone coverage,
it is likely the percentage of the rural population owning or accessing a mobile phone
has increased since the 2009–2010 HIES.

BPNG has responded positively to the mobile banking opportunity. Mobile Network
Operators have been given exemptions under Banks and Financial Institutions Act
2000 to conduct mobile phone banking.

Levels of mobile phone banking penetration are currently not known, but are
considered to be low relative to other financial services access channels.

     and Madang


     3.1.	Overview
     Morobe and Madang provinces are two adjoining provinces within what is termed
     the Momase (or sometimes the Mamose) region (an abbreviation of Morobe, Madang
     and Sepik one of the four regions of Papua New Guinea. The other regions are: the
     Highlands, New Guinea Islands and Papuan (or Southern) regions.

     PNG is geographically, economically and ethnically extremely diverse, from its
     communities in remote valleys in the Highlands provinces, to coastal and lowland
     communities on some of the country’s islands, coasts and accessible and inaccessible
     major valleys. Morobe and Madang are in some ways a microcosm of many of the
     diverse geographical and social characteristics of Papua New Guinea. It is impossible

for any province, or small selection of provinces to represent the entire country’s
range of physical and human characteristics, nevertheless, Morobe and Madang do
reflect some of that diversity.

Both provinces span broad altitudinal ranges, from the country’s highest mountains,
notably in the Bismarck, Finisterre and Sarawaget ranges, to the major lowland
valleys of the Markham and Ramu rivers, and an array of wide and narrow coastal
plains, with wet and drier climates, and large and smaller offshore and more remote
islands.




3.2.	Population
Population Overview

Momase has the second highest population by region, according to the 2011 National
Census, with 1.9 million, comprising 26 percent of the country’s population. The
largest region by population is the Highlands, recorded with 39 percent of the total
population.

Morobe province is the largest province in PNG by population (674,810 persons
recorded in the 2011 National Census—9 percent of the National population), and the
fifth largest by physical area, at 33,525 sq. km. Madang province has the fourth largest
provincial population according to the 2011 Census (493,906—7 percent of PNG’s
population), after Morobe, Eastern Highlands and Southern Highlands, and is also one
of the larger provinces in the country by physical area.

                                   The populations of the two major urban centres, and the smaller towns of Morobe
                                   province, reflect the wide hinterland, with residents, including settlements, both from
                                   the local communities (notably Ahi in Lae) and from other parts of the two respective
                                   provinces and elsewhere across the Momase and Highlands regions. This provides
                                   both these centres with a diverse social and ethnic mix, as well as a wide range of
                                   household incomes. Papua New Guinea has a high proportion of its population under
                                   20. The median age recorded in the 2011 National Census for the whole country was

total population was recorded as migrants in 2011 (i.e. not born where they were
enumerated in the Census), with 40 percent of urban citizens recorded as migrants
and 9 percent of rural citizens. Morobe, which includes the large urban centre of Lae,
was above the national average and Madang province, with relatively small urban
centres, was below the national average. In-migration comes from both rural areas
within the respective provinces, and from other provinces, particularly heading for the
main urban centres, like Lae and Madang, and commercial projects, in agriculture and
mining. Major out-migration from Morobe and Madang provinces heads to the National
Capital District particularly.




3.3.	Economy and Livelihoods
The provinces are diverse economically, with major mining and agricultural projects, from
gold and nickel mining (notably in Bulolo District, Morobe, and Usino-Bundi in Madang) to
oil palm, sugar, cattle and other livestock in the major Ramu and Markham valleys, coffee,
vegetable and plantation forestry in the upland valleys, such as around Wau-Bulolo, and
cocoa and copra, particularly on the major Madang island of Karkar. Commercial fisheries
(and fish processing) are centred on the Madang and Lae ports and urban vicinities,
tourism particularly in Madang and its lagoon hinterland, and logging also prevalent in
certain coastal areas, particularly Madang province and parts of Morobe’s Siassi islands.
Just over half the population of the two provinces recorded in 2011 was employed in
subsistence agriculture (particularly women), just below the national average recorded,
whereas about 12 percent of the Morobe population was recorded as engaged in wage
employment, and just below 10 percent in Madang, both near the national average, and
with higher percentages in paid employment amongst males.

Both Morobe and Madang provinces recorded 70–80 percent of households growing
food crops (around the national average); although the large urban population of Lae

                                   recorded as growing food crops). The record also shows that nearly 80 percent of
                                   Madang households participate in growing betel nut, significantly above the national
                                   average. Over 90 percent of households in the two provinces also recorded selling
                                   betel nut (and associated mustard), almost as many as growing, and food crops
                                   (somewhat lower the portion producing). Over 90 percent of households in the two
                                   provinces live in their own homes, roughly the national average, and these houses are
                                   largely made of traditional materials.

Lae and to a lesser extend Madang have become hubs not only of formal sector
business but extensive informal sector trade, with a hinterland, particularly for
Lae, stretching well beyond, as well as being major administrative and education
centres, each with universities, teacher training and technical colleges and research
institutes.




3.4.	Infrastructure and Services
Transport

As across much of Papua New Guinea, transport infrastructure in Morobe and
Madang provinces is rudimentary, with large portions of the provinces inaccessible
by road, particularly during the wet season. The two provinces include some of the
country’s major national highways, notably the Highlands (or Okuk) Highway up the
Markham valley and the Wau-Bulolo road in Morobe province, and the Ramu-Madang
Highway and north coast road to Bogia in Madang province. Nevertheless, these
National Highways suffer from poor maintenance, and even become impassable at
times. The provincial and local access roads into the districts suffer from much worse
maintenance funding and, as with the rural airstrips, extensive stretches of these
roads have closed down temporarily or permanently over the past two decades,

                                   leaving whole communities dependent upon pedestrian access only, and undermining
                                   access to markets and public services. As stated in the NEFC (National Economic and
                                   Fiscal Commission) report, ‘The Thin Blue Line’ (NEFC, 2014) “a large proportion of
                                   the road network has deteriorated to the point where ‘routine maintenance’ is not
                                   possible and major maintenance or rehabilitation is now necessary.” Yet, as that report
                                   highlighted, the cost of rehabilitation is much greater (“reconstruction of public assets
                                   can be 40–130 times more expensive than the annual cost of routine maintenance”),
                                   and that restoration of the entire network is unaffordable in the short–medium
                                   term. A World Bank sector study (2003) found that the severe decline in funding for
                                   maintenance, notably during the 1990s, resulted in a severe deterioration in the state
                                   of the country’s road assets and an accumulated backlog of work to be addressed. It
                                   found that only 49 percent of what was needed for road maintenance was provided
                                   in 1991, declining to 30 percent in 1994 and a mere 10 percent by 2001. Funding for

infrastructure maintenance and restoration remained at only a fraction of the level
required through the 2000s, only starting to improve modestly from the end of the

decades, along with improved revenue.

Following the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Government the
different roads and other infrastructure were meant to be classified as falling under
National, Provincial and Local Level Government responsibility, respectively, with
unconditional grants provided accordingly. Such classification of specific roads and
airstrips, etc., and associated funding, did not materialise, and for at least a decade
there was uncertainty, with much infrastructure left in a vacuum of responsibility
for most non-national roads and airstrips. With the discontinuation of the Works
Department in many provinces, there was also little or no human capacity or
equipment at the District or LLG levels to undertake routine maintenance, and, as with

                                     occur was often left to ad-hoc community action and activity organised by service
                                     providers (such as mission air service providers). Based upon the 2005 Department of
                                     Works Road Asset Management System (RAMS) report, and their 2011 update, it has
                                     been calculated that an allocation of K15.2 million was required for basic maintenance
                                     of existing provincial, district and local level infrastructure (largely rural roads) in
                                     Morobe province and K12.6 million for Madang province, when unsealed provincial

                                     roads were estimated to cost K10,500 per km to maintain. Only a fraction of these
                                     amounts have been available during these years and even smaller fraction of this level
                                     of funding has been provided for this purpose, although in recent years under the

                                     for roads/transport. The planning and capacity have been largely deficient and much

Telecommunications

Whilst PNG’s main urban centres have been connected by telephone since the 1970s,
using then state of the art microwave signals and mountain-top repeater stations, mobile
phone access was only rolled out in the main urban centres in the early 2000s, with only
very limited subscribers and access until mid-2007. The commencement of a competitor
in 2007, and new investment in urban and rural services, saw the number of subscribers
more than double within 3 weeks. Although still costly by world standards, access to
mobile telephony and subsequently data services expanded considerably since 2007, unit
costs fell and reliability and speed increased particularly in the urban centres, such as Lae
and Madang, where 3G (and later 4G) services were introduced; in rural areas 2G services
have remained predominant, although a program of upgrading has been ongoing. All the
urban households in Morobe and Madang provinces have ready access to mobile-phone
based telecommunications, and in 2014 most of the rural population had access, at least
within a short walk from their villages. Only one of the current two operators of mobile
telephone services provides any significant rural coverage.


Electricity

Power is only accessible in the main urban centres in Morobe and Madang provinces,
in small townships and villages along the main highways and in the some district
centres. The 2008 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) found that
nationwide only 16.7 percent of the population had access to electricity from the grid
in their households, 6.3 percent in rural areas, and 67.8 percent in urban areas, with
a further 2.8 percent having access to privately generated power. In the Momase
region (including Morobe and Madang provinces) the figure for access to the grid fell
to 5.9 percent of the population, despite the presence of larger cities like Lae, and
1.8 percent private generation.


Education

School enrolment has been improving over the past decade, but enrolment,
retention, standards and levels of literacy and numeracy remain low, especially in
rural communities. Morobe and Madang provinces were both close to the national
average in the 2011 National Census in terms of the percentage of citizens recording
ever having been to school, at about 57–58 percent for the two provinces, as against
approximately 56 percent nationwide. About 10 percent more males recorded
having been to school in Morobe and nearer 7 percent in Madang, which was almost
identical to the national average. Urban areas recorded almost 80 percent of citizens
having attended school at some stage, as opposed to just over 50 percent in rural

areas. 70 percent literacy was recorded amongst citizens in the Census in 2011 for
Morobe province, and about 68 percent for Madang province, which was also about
the national average, with rates amongst females about 4–5 percent lower than
males. Urban areas again showed markedly higher literacy rates, at almost 80 percent
average, than rural areas, at somewhat above 60 percent.


Health

Papua New Guinea health indicators are poor and although there have been some
improvements, for example in reduced malarial incidence over the past decade, key
indicators (including health Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child
health and mortality rates) remain extremely unsatisfactory. For example infant
(under 1 year of age) mortality rates were recorded as reducing from 69.3 deaths per
                                                             24
1,000 live births, to 56.7 deaths between 1996 and 2006. The equivalent figures for
MOMASE region were 76/1,000 in 1996 and 55/1,000 in 2006. Urban infant mortality
rates are 32 per 1,000 live births, but rural rates of 62/1,000, and major variations
relate to levels of education, than with infant mortality rates more than twice as great
for those with no education, than those with grade 7 or more. Health is determined
by multiple factors, including access to information, women’s education and
empowerment, access to economic opportunities, as well as natural environment and
access to quality health services.

In much of Papua New Guinea health services have been recorded as having
deteriorated over the past decade, in both range of the services provided and quality
(Howes et al., 2014). The cost of health service provision varies considerably from one

                                   part of the country to another, as determined particularly by remoteness. The largest
                                   portion of costs (approx. 84 percent) was calculated by NEFC to be needed at the
                                   District level. Morobe was estimated by NEFC to require approximately K11 million
                                   for health sector costs, and Madang around K 9 million, with a substantial portion
                                   of that explicitly for patient transfers. Based upon the Department of Health’s policy
                                   on patient transfers and the NEFC’s costs of services study (reflecting the portion of
                                   the population living in relatively isolated locations and other factors), Morobe, with
                                   both its large population and large rural population requires K3.6 million for patient
                                   transfers alone, and Madang requires K2.6 million: the highest transfer costs by
                                   province. This level of funding was not made available. According to the report ‘Below
                                   the Glass Floor’ (World Bank, 2013a) frontline spending in Morobe province was ‘low’
                                   compared to what was required (with consistently low levels of funding for health
                                   services, including water supply and sanitation, notably in 2009/10), and ‘medium’ for
                                   Madang province (where funding was increased markedly in 2009 and 2010).

                                   There is good access to formal financial services access points in urban and township
                                   locations. Commercial banking and finance company services are available in the
                                   two provincial capitals (Lae and Madang). Retail banking services, including ATM
                                   and EFTPOS services are available at multiple locations (refer to Table 2) in Lae and
                                   Madang and also in the townships of Bulolo and Finschafen. ATMs are principally co-
                                   located with bank branches. There are, however, several stand-alone ATMs in Lae and
                                                                                                        25

Savings and Loan and microfinance institutions also have outlets in the provinces.
Similar to the commercial banks and finance companies, S&Ls and microfinance
organisations are located in urban and township locations. Post PNG has six outlets
in Morobe and Madang, and also in urban or township locations.

Overall, for 1st Quarter 2015, Momase had a total of 2,579 formal financial services
access points (including EFTPOS). Morobe province had 1,586 and Madang 475. The
number of financial services access points has increased by 38.7 percent in Morobe
                                                                        26
and 18.31 percent in Madang over the last three year (2012–2015).

In addition to accessibility to financial services access points, households in urban and
township communities in Morobe and Madang have access to a full range of formal
financial services. Savings, long term savings and investment services and credit
services (including asset finance) are offered by multiple financial services providers.
Levels of competition have not been examined by the present study. However, a range
of products, within product categories and price points, can be selected. Consumers in
urban location appear to have both access and choice.

The situation in rural communities in both Morobe and Madang is very different to that
of urban and township communities. Only one bank, BSP, has a rural agent network.
The number of rural agents, relative to the rural population is, however small. A very
significant proportion of the rural population in Morobe and Madang effectively have
no, or very limited access to formal financial services. In addition, the range of financial
services available to rural communities is very limited. Products and services are limited
to those which can be offered by agents. Complex products and products which require
financial advice prior to purchase (for example credit and long term savings products)
have very limited availability. Overall, it appears most consumers in rural location in
Morobe and Madang have neither access to formal financial services or a set of financial
products and services from which to select an appropriate product.

     4.  Financial Inclusion
     in Morobe and Madang


     4.1.  Facilitators of Financial Inclusion
     In addition to examining use of financial services, respondents’ confidence in
     communicating in English, both oral and written, and access to and ability to use a
     mobile phone was also examined.


     Confidence with Communicating in English

     The ability to communicate in using English facilitates financial inclusion. The ability
     to communicate in English is not a pre-requisite for financial inclusion. It is likely
     many counter interactions will be undertaken in Tok Pisin. However, most documents
     are written in English. This includes account opening and contract documents, many
     brochures and EFTPOS and ATM receipts. The ability to communicate in English,
     in particular the ability to be able to read documents written in English facilitates
     financial inclusion.

     Nearly 60 percent of respondents stated they could not communicate in English.
     Responses tended to bifurcate. Most respondents stated that either they could not
     communicate in English at all, or they could communicate in English both verbally
     and using written media (read and/or write). Very few respondents stated they could
     only speak English. Overall men were more likely than women to state they were
     able to communicate in English (46.8 percent of men compared to 26.1 percent of
     women). There were significant location based differences in respondents’ confidence
     in communicating in English. Eighty-two percent (82 percent) of urban respondents
     and 56 percent of township respondents stated they could communicate in English,
     compared to 29 percent of rural respondents. All men and 75 percent of women living
     in urban communities stated they could speak English. By contrast only 38 percent
     of men and 23 percent of women living in rural communities stated they could
     speak English. The location and gender differences in respondents’ confidence in
     communicating in English are summarised in Figure 18.


     Use of Mobile Phones

     The lack of financial services infrastructure in many rural communities suggests the
     extension of financial services to rural communities will require the use of mobile

phone telephony, to both enable agents and merchants to connect to the payments
system and to enable financial services customers to access their accounts. Access to
a mobile phone and the ability to use mobile phone text functions therefore facilitates
financial inclusion.

There are significant differences in the level of mobile phone ownership and ability to
use mobile phone functionality between urban and rural communities and men and
women. As discussed above, the 2009–2010 HIES found that, overall, 49.1 percent of
households in PNG owned a mobile phone. A slightly lower percentage of households
in rural communities reported owning a mobile phone (42.5 percent). By contrast
89.2 percent of households in urban communities reported owning a mobile phone.
Overall it is considered likely the level of ownership or access to mobile phones in
rural communities in PNG will have increased since the last HIES.

The present study found similar levels of mobile phone ownership to those reported in
the 2009–2010 HIES. As shown in Table 3, in urban and township communities, access to
a mobile phone is high. Most respondents who owned or had access to a mobile phone
were also able to use the phone to text as well as using the phone for calls. By contrast,
levels of mobile phone access in rural areas were low, particularly by women. This may
be due, at least in part, to several of the CUs sampled having no mobile phone access.

Mobile phone capability was also more limited, again particularly by women. The
combination of access and capability suggests that there is a high capacity for mobile
phone based financial services in urban communities. At present, however, the capacity to
extend mobile phone banking into rural communities may be constrained by access and
capability issues, in particular for women. It appears that, without capacity development,
approximately 30 percent of men and 10 percent of women living in rural communities in
Morobe and Madang may currently be able to use a mobile banking service.

                                    The remoteness of the rural community from an urban area does not appear to be a
                                    principal driver in mobile phone access and usage. Seventy three percent (73 percent)
                                    of respondents living within an hour of an urban area stated they owned or could
                                    access a mobile phone. This reduced to 40 percent for respondents living 1–3 hours, and
                                    31.6 percent for respondents living 3–9 hours from an urban area. However 56.7 percent
                                    of respondents living more than 9 hours from an urban area stated they owned or had
                                    access to a mobile phone. It is, of course, likely the respondents’ ownership/access to a
                                    mobile phone is related to the presence in the area of a mobile phone tower.




                                    4.2.	Use of Formal Financial Services
                                    This section of the report examines the number of financial products owned by
                                    respondents, and the range of products owned across the following categories:
                                    Savings, long term savings and credit. Respondents’ payment and remittance activity
                                    is also overviewed.


                                    Number of Financial Products Owned

                                    The number of financial products (both formal and informal) owned by respondents,
                                    varied significantly by gender, location and source of livelihood. As shown in Table 4,
                                    in rural communities 60.2 percent of men and 81 percent of women reported owning
                                    no financial product; by contrast, in urban communities men reported owning
                                    3.4 financial products on average and women own only 1.3 financial products. There
                                    were significant differences in financial product ownership by principal source of
                                    livelihood. Perhaps not surprisingly, those in formal employment were significantly
                                    more likely to report owning financial products than those in informal employment.
                                    However, even within livelihood categories, men were more likely to report product
                                    ownership than women. Nearly 93 percent of men employed in the formal sector
                                    reported owning at least one financial product, compared to 66 percent of women.
                                    Whilst information on a specific occupation was not collected, it is possible the
                                    higher level of account ownership by men working in the formal sector may relate
                                    to employment in organisations which pay wages by credit to a bank account, rather
                                    than in cash.

Account ownership by urban and township respondents who were self-employed or
working in the informal sector was lower than for respondents working in the formal
sector (refer to Table 4). Levels of financial inclusion were, however, significantly
higher than those reported by respondents employed in the informal sector in rural
communities. Fifty-six percent (56 percent) of women and nearly 78 percent of men
reported owning at least one financial product. Overall, whilst there continues to be a
significant number of urban dwellers who do not have at least one financial product,
in particular women, the large scale financial exclusion appears to be far more
                                                                     26
pervasive in rural communities than in urban communities.   < >


Overview of Financial Products Owned

Financial products were grouped by category. The savings category included debit
card based savings and transaction products, and passbook based products from
banks, S&Ls and microfinance providers. The long term savings category included
term deposits, provident/superannuation, unit trust/shares and life insurance. Credit
included any form of formal credit and Protection covered house/contents or car
insurance.

Overall, as shown in Table 5, those employed in the formal sector were more likely
to own financial services in each of the product categories, in particular savings and
long term savings. Men were more likely to report product ownership in each product
category than women. Overall men were twice as likely as women to report product
ownership.

                                      Households in urban communities have access to a broad range of financial services
                                      from a range of financial services providers. Evidence from Morobe and Madang
                                      suggests that, whilst formal sector employment provides a pathway to ownership
                                      of a savings/transaction account and long term savings, 50–75 percent of urban
                                      respondents deriving informal sector income as their principal form of income
                                      were also likely to own at least a savings account. The majority of rural households,
                                      however, have little or no access to the formal financial system and own few financial
                                      products.


                                      Payments and Remittances

                                      This section examines modalities used for payment for goods and services purchased
                                      and the receipt of income, and also remittance modalities used by households, both
                                      outward and inward remittances.

                                      As shown in Table 6, nearly all households reported incurring expenditure on day-
                                                                                                                      27

                                      urban household reported having mains electricity, compared to 7 percent of rural

                                      households) and were less likely to incur expenditure for rent/lease payments or
                                      taxes. Overall, urban households and households in townships were more financially
                                      active and both more likely to incur expenditure across a wider range of expenditure

As shown in Table 7, the most common mode of payment for day-day expenditures and
bills, irrespective of whether the household had an account, was cash. Nevertheless,
approximately 21 percent of urban households and 12 percent of rural households that
reported owning a card-based account also reported paying for day-day items using
electronic payment. This suggests increased EFTPOS and ATM penetration is resulting in

                                   In both urban and rural communities, households with a bank account were more
                                   likely to use the mobile phone to pay for services (7 percent of rural households and
                                   11 percent of urban households).

                                   The use of electronic (bank-bank) payment for school/university fees, loan repayments
                                   and rent/lease payments was common, irrespective of whether the household had
                                   an account. The reasons for this are not immediately obvious and follow-up research
                                   may be warranted (or perhaps included in further deployment of the financial
                                   capability survey) to determine how households who do not have a bank account
                                   make electronic payments (other than through the Post Office or a wire service). It
                                   is also possible there are language issues. As discussed in Chapter One, translation
                                   of financial constructs from English to Tok Pisin can be challenging due to the lack of
                                   construct equivalence.


                                   Receipts

                                   Patterns of income receipt varied between households in urban communities and
                                   those in rural communities. As shown in Table 8, urban and township households were
                                   significantly more likely than rural households to report receipt of wages (both formal
                                   and informal wages). Most households reported receipt of payments for sales. In urban
                                                                                               30
                                   households this appears to be primarily secondary income. Urban households were
                                   also more likely to report receipt of rent/lease and interest income.

                                   Payment for sales was primarily cash based, irrespective of location or whether the
                                   respondent had a bank account (refer to Table 9). A similar issue emerges in respect
                                   to receipt of wage/salary income (and also rental income in urban households) as
                                   discussed above for electronic payments by respondents who reported not owning
                                   a bank account. Reported levels of receipt of wages/salary to an account were
                                   high, even for respondents who reported they did not own an account. There are

instances where one member of the household reported receiving wages or salary by
electronic transfer, but it was another member of the household who reported having
a bank account. Further investigation is required and there may be value in adding
questions to the national survey to explore payment and receipt using a third-party
bank account. It is possible income received by household members who do not have
a bank account is directed to a bank account held by another household member
(within the context of this study typically the partner). It is also possible that some
households bank accounts, irrespective of ‘ownership’, are managed or controlled by
one member of the household who may receive income on behalf of other members
of the household. The low level of cash receipt of wages/salary by township houses
may be due to sampling (in particular Hospital and Forestry employment).


Remittances

Remittance activity (sending or receiving funds to a person in another location) was
more common in urban households than rural households. As shown in Figure 19,
nearly 80 percent of urban respondents stated they sent remittances and 60 percent
that they received remittances. The most common method of sending or receiving a
remittance in urban communities was by bank transfer. Interestingly approximately
5 percent of remittances were sent/received using the mobile phone. The use of the
mail or personal delivery was also common. The PNG Financial Diaries Study (Stuart,

                                   participants based in or proximate to Port Moresby, Goroka and Kimbe. The remittance
                                   transactions captured by the financial diaries study indicated participants made
                                   remittance transfers to a wide spread of locations across PNG. If the pattern found
                                   by the financial diaries study is replicated in Morobe and Madang, it is possible that
                                   remittance transfers to a large number of rural communities may need to be effected
                                   by mail or personal delivery, simply because there is no other way of effecting the
                                   remittance. The density of bank branches in rural communities is low across PNG, and
                                                                                                                            31
                                   Post PNG estimates 60 percent of the PNG population cannot access a postal outlet.
                                   This may also explain the relatively low level of SMK transfers cited by respondents.

                                   Levels of remittance activity in rural communities, both sending and receiving
                                   funds, were approximately half those of urban communities. The dominant form of
                                   remittance was mail or personal delivery. As stated above, it is likely this is due to
                                   the lack of rural financial services and postal services infrastructure in many rural

                                   In general terms, households that had a bank account tended to use the account for
                                   safekeeping of cash, whilst households which did not have a bank account tended to
                                   keep money hidden or in a locked box (or similar). Thirty four percent (34 percent) of
                                   rural households that had a bank account also kept money hidden. This may be due to
                                   the distance required to travel to an access point to lodge or withdraw funds.

Savings Accounts

Globally, 50–60 percent of adults in developing economies report owning an account
at a bank or another type of financial institution (Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper, Singer, & Van
Oudheusden, 2015). As shown in Table 10, in Morobe and Madang, whilst men are more
likely to report savings account ownership than women, overall more than 40 percent of
adults living in urban or township areas reported owning a savings account, primarily a
savings account with EFTPOS and ATM capability. In rural areas less than 10 percent of the
adult population reported owning an account, whether card based or passbook based.

The correlation between ownership of savings account and distance from the nearest
bank branch is significant (r = .229, p < .001). The average distance to a bank branch
for urban or township residents is estimated to be less than 5km, for rural residents
it is estimated to be 38km (with a significant number of households living more
than 38km from the nearest bank branch). The correlation between savings account
ownership and formal employment is also significant (r = .263, p < .001). The two
factors are, of course related given the concentration of formal employment in urban
areas. The relationship between account ownership and distance to a bank branch is
shown graphically in Figure 20.

                                   There is an overlap in the type of savings account owned, 21 percent of debit card
                                   based savings account owners also reported owning a passbook account. Dual
                                   account ownership was reported for both urban and rural households, and for formal
                                   and informal sector livelihoods. Commercial banks in PNG no longer offer passbook
                                   based accounts, whilst other financial institutions (in particular microfinance banks)
                                   continue to offer passbook based savings account. This suggests up to one in five
                                   adults who have an account at a commercial bank may also have an account at
                                   another regulated financial institution.

                                   There is tentative evidence that ownership of a savings account increases the
                                   propensity to save. As shown in Figure 21, irrespective of whether income is derived
                                   from (regular) formal sector wages or salary or (more intermittent) informal sector
                                   employment or self-employment, households that have a savings account are more
                                   likely to endeavour to save money regularly for the future and to have a provision for
                                   emergencies or unexpected expenses.

respondents cited ownership of a range of long term products, issues with translation
to Tok Pisin may result in the blurring of categories, in particular between provident/
superannuation, life insurance and unit trusts.

Approximately 50–55 percent of formal sector employees reported having a
provident or superannuation account. The reasons why 45–50 percent of adults who
reported formal sector employment did not also report membership of a provident/
superannuation fund are not known. It is possible adults who did not report provident
fund membership may have been primarily casual wage workers, or employed in small
     32
firms. As shown in Table 11, the gender-based difference in employment patterns
results in men being significantly more likely to report owning long term savings and
investment products than women, irrespective of location.


Credit

The Global Findex (Demirguc-Kunt, et al., 2015) found approximately 9 percent of
adults in developing countries reported borrowing from a formal financial institution.
The present study found approximately 7 percent of households reported some form
of formal credit obligation. Urban households were significantly more likely to report
a formal loan than rural households (32 percent of urban households, compared to
3 percent of rural households). Within the context of urban households, formal credit
obligations are more common in households in which the principal source of income
was formal sector wages/salary (42 percent of households) than informal sector
income (24 percent of households).

Whilst it is possible that one in five urban households has a secured loan and
approximately one in four households has a business loan (refer to Table 12), the levels

                                   of reported urban formal sector credit should be regarded as tentative, in particular
                                   when compared to levels of insurance policy ownership (which would usually be
                                   associated with security commitments for formal loans). Once the national study has
                                   been completed, levels of reported formal sector borrowing should be correlated to
                                   levels of consumer lending by banks, savings and loans and microfinance institutions
                                   (and potentially finance companies).


                                   Protection

                                   Levels of home and car insurance were measured by the present study and very low
                                   levels of insurance were reported. Less than two percent (2 percent) of households
                                   in Morobe and Madang reported owning house or motor vehicle insurance.
                                   Approximately 8 percent of urban households reported having an insurance policy,
                                   compared to 1 percent of rural households. The level of insurance is significantly lower
                                   than the reported level of secured borrowing (and underscores caution in respect to
                                   reported levels of secured borrowing).

                                   There would appear to be a lot of work to be done in order to progress the use of
                                                                                        33
                                   insurance generally in PNG. Anecdotal evidence indicates the issue of very low
                                   levels of insurance may be pervasive in PNG and may not be limited to insurance over
                                   domestic property.

                                   It is evident that many households in Morobe and Madang, in particular rural
                                   households, have limited engagement with the formal financial sector. The estimate

found levels of debit card based savings account ownership to be 15 percent. Overall
22 percent of the population of Morobe and Madang reported owning some form of
savings account.

Whether a narrow measure or broad measure of account ownership is used, the
figure masks a very major difference in levels of financial exclusion across Morobe and
Madang. Urban households, whether deriving income from formal sector employment
or participation in the informal sector, exhibit levels of financial inclusion (as measured
by account ownership) similar to or greater than those typically found in developing
countries. It is to be expected households deriving income from formal sector
employment will be more likely to own a bank account and to have some form of long
term savings (primarily provident). This appears to be the case for households deriving
formal sector income in Morobe and Madang, irrespective of whether the household
is located in an urban or rural location. However, formal sector employment in rural
communities is limited. Overall, levels of financial inclusion in rural communities are
very low.

The principal issue appears to be lack of rural financial services infrastructure. Most
rural households simply cannot access the formal financial system. The difference in
the use of formal financial services between urban and rural communities is pervasive
across all product categories. Households in rural communities that have a bank
account are more likely to use cash for payments and less likely to remit or receive
money electronically than urban households, are significantly less likely to keep cash
safe in an account, are less likely to have long term savings and less likely to have a
formal loan.


Gender
Women in PNG appear to be significantly more likely to be financially excluded than
men and, if women do have an engagement with the formal financial sector, the scope
of the engagement is generally more limited than for men. The gender gap in respect
to the ownership of financial services appears to be significantly larger in Morobe and
Madang than is typical for countries other than PNG. Globally 58 percent of women
reported owning a bank account, compared with 65 percent of men, a 7 percentage
                  34
point difference. Levels of financial inclusion (as measured by ownership of a bank
account) are lower in Morobe and Madang than the global average. However, as
discussed above, in urban households levels of account ownership are significantly

                                   higher than in rural communities. Sixty eight percent (68 percent) of men and
                                   38 percent of women in urban households reported owning some form of savings
                                   account.

                                   Levels of financial inclusion, across all product categories are lower for women than
                                   for men. In part this can be explained by the greater percentage of women earning
                                   informal income. However, even for women earning formal sector income, levels of
                                   participation in the formal financial sector are lower than those of men. The reasons
                                   for this cannot be attributed solely to access. Most households in urban areas need
                                   to travel less than 5km to access financial services. The present study has sought to
                                   develop an understanding of levels of financial inclusion and product usage. The study
                                   has not sought to explain why there is such a pervasive and persistent difference in
                                   levels of financial inclusion between men and women, and the range of factors which
                                   appear to exacerbate gender difference in financial inclusion in urban communities.
                                   The issue is significant and it is possible that, as levels of financial inclusion increase
                                   across PNG generally, the gender gap will continue to widen. Further investigation is
                                   required to understand gendered drivers of financial exclusion and to facilitate the
                                   development of programs to bring greater numbers of women into the formal financial
                                   system. Nevertheless, reported urban levels of account ownership by men suggest
                                   financial inclusion programmes in Morobe and Madang should focus on women living
                                   in urban communities and focus on both men and women living in rural communities.


                                   Affordability

                                   The cost of financial services is often cited as one of the principal reasons for financial
                                   exclusion in PNG, in particular financial exclusion by poor and low income households.
                                   It is not uncommon, for example, when conducting focus groups to be advised that
                                   a member of the focus group either has opened a bank account, or knows someone
                                   who has opened a bank account and deposited a sum of money, and then checked the
                                   balance sometime later to find the account had been closed as fees had extinguished
                                                35
                                   the balance. The veracity of these statements has never been tested.

                                   Typical financial account transaction patterns for poor households in PNG are not known.
                                   The PNG Financial Diaries Study suggested 2–3 account transactions per month (one
                                   deposit and two withdrawals). However levels of account ownership by participants in
                                   the study were very low. In an effort to develop some understanding of the likelihood
                                   of account affordability, two transaction scenarios were modelled against the poverty
                                   line. It was assumed a household living on the poverty line has a basic bank account and
                                                                              36

Scenario 1: Regular receipt of funds, savings and payments
Scenario 2: Savings only



The poverty line for PNG varies between NCD (Port Moresby) and the rest of PNG. The
poverty line in NCD is estimated to be approximately PGK3500pa. The poverty line for
the rest of PNG is estimated to be approximately PGK1700pa (World Bank, 2012). The
annual cost of financial services (the sum of account keeping and transaction fees) was
modelled for the highest cost basic commercial bank account and lowest cost basic
                              37
commercial bank account currently available in Morobe and Madang. Annual account
costs are shown in Table 13.

Account keeping costs could range between 3 percent and 22 percent of household
income at poverty line if an account is used for savings only and 8 percent and
40 percent of household income at poverty line if an account is used for regular receipt
of funds, savings and bill payments. The model suggests the affordability of financial
services may be a function of access to a range of financial services. If the lowest cost
option is available to poor and low income households, it is likely a significant number
of households would be able to afford a basic bank account for savings. The individual
income estimates provided by participants in the present study suggest higher levels
of affordability.

                                   4.4.	Use of Informal Financial Services
                                   Understanding of the pervasiveness and use of informal financial services in PNG, both
                                   savings and credit, is limited. The financial capability survey collected information in
                                   respect to product ownership. Information was not collected in respect to transaction
                                   frequency, cost and functionality. The pervasiveness of informal financial services,
                                   particularly in rural areas where formal financial services are commonly not available,
                                   suggests further research may be warranted.


                                   Savings

                                   Evidence from the present study suggests informal savings is associated with
                                   employment (refer to Table 14). Respondents were asked if they participated in a
                                   Sunday-Sunday and, in addition to being asked about provident/superannuation
                                   savings, respondents were asked if they saved using a scheme provided by their
                                                                   38
                                   employer. A previous study had found employees working on a plantation used an
                                   employer provided savings scheme to provide for their children’s education. As has
                                   been stated in other sections of this report, there are construct issues translating
                                   financial terms from English to Tok Pisin. Nevertheless, 34 percent of respondents
                                   who stated they contributed to provident/superannuation also stated they saved with
                                   their employer. Even allowing for some misinterpretation between employer provided
                                   savings, employment based ‘Sunday-Sunday’ schemes and provident/superannuation
                                   contributions, informal savings appears to be closely related to formal sector
                                   employment, irrespective of the modality.


                                   Credit

                                   Global evidence indicates adults in developing countries are more likely to borrow
                                   from family and friends than other sources. Demirguc-Kunt and colleagues (2015),
                                   reviewing Global Findex data found borrowing from family and friends to be the
                                   most common source of finance for people in all countries other than high income

countries. Findex data indicates 29 percent of adults reported borrowing from family
or friends. In several regions more people reported borrowing from a store than
reported borrowing from a financial institution. Less than 5 percent of adults around
the world reported borrowing from a private informal lender (Demirguc-Kunt, et al.,
2015).

As shown in Table 15, levels of borrowing from money lenders found in Morobe and
Madang are similar to levels found in countries other than PNG. The characteristics of
money lending in PNG are not well understood. Information tends to be anecdotal and
is frequently pejorative, equating money lending with loan sharking. Evidence from
the focus groups undertaken as part of the development of the financial capability
survey instrument indicated that, at least in some rural areas, money lending may not
be loan sharking but may be means of augmenting household income as well as being
a source of funding for the household: adults in households with surplus liquidity lent
the money to households with a liquidity shortfall.

As shown in Table 15, levels of borrowing from family/friends are lower in the present
study than those found by the Global Findex, and slightly lower than those found in
other Pacific island studies. This may be because the financial capability study (and the
financial competency studies in several Pacific island countries) has only examined
borrowing from family and friends that must be repaid and does not include loans
which create a reciprocal, rather than financial, obligation.

Store credit is an important form of short term finance, in particular for rural
households. Anecdotal evidence indicates store credit is typically interest free and
the duration is typically days or, at most, weeks. The characteristics of stores which
provide store credit (or do not provide store credit) and importantly, the impact of
store credit on the viability of trade-stores is not well understood. The levels of store
credit found by the present study are significantly lower than those found in other
studies in PNG and other Pacific island countries. To some extent this may be due to
location differences; the Morobe/Madang study is the only study to explore financial

                                   (the PFIP financial competence studies only examined low income communities). To
                                   some extent the lower level of reported use of store credit may be due to a (common)
                                   misunderstanding that purchase of goods with deferred payment is a form of credit.

                                   Overall 34 percent of urban households reported formal borrowing and 24 percent
                                   informal borrowing. By contrast 3 percent of rural households reported formal

                                   families and clans, and trade-store owners who extend credit for consumption
                                   purposes.

                                        of Financial Products
                                   Overall, 37 percent of household financial decision makers stated they were involved
                                   in the selection of financial products used by the household. However, thirty nine
                                   percent (39 percent) of households stated no one was responsible for financial
                                   product selection. There were significant gender differences within households.
                                   Approximately half of the men who made financial decisions on behalf of their
                                   household stated they were involved (individually or jointly with their partner) in the
                                   selection of household financial products. By contrast only a quarter of women stated
                                   they were involved in financial product selection. A further 28 percent of women
                                   stated they were not involved in the selection of financial products and that this was
                                   an activity for which their partner was responsible (less than 2 percent of men stated
                                   their partner was solely responsible). The gender difference was further amplified in
                                   urban households. Sixty eight percent (68 percent) of men living in urban households
                                   stated they were solely responsible for the selection of the household’s financial
                                   products, compared to 14 percent of women.

                                   Overall women are less involved in all forms of household financial product selection.
                                   Women’s principal source of livelihood appears to play a role in encouraging active
                                   engagement in household financial product selection (as it does in with participation
                                   in the formal financial sector generally). As shown in Table 16, whilst overall women
                                   were more likely to state their partner was responsible for financial product selection,
                                   women employed in the formal sector were three times more likely to state they were

involved in the selection of household financial products than women working in the
informal sector. Overall, formal sector employment also appears to influence active
engagement in the selection of financial products. Formal sector employees were
3–6 times less likely to state no one in the household was responsible for financial
product selection than those who derived their income from the informal sector or
self-employment.

     5.  Financial Capability
     in Morobe and Madang


     Financial capability encompasses a broad range of financial knowledge and skill,
     behaviour and attitudes. As discussed in Chapter Two, the present study has sought
     to develop an understanding of the financial capability of adults in Morobe and
     Madang. The Morobe and Madang dataset will contribute to the national dataset. The
     following analysis has examined financial capability, with a particular focus on gender
     differences, differences between rural and urban households and differences between
     respondents whose primary source of income was from formal sector employment
     and respondents whose primary source of income was from the informal sector
     or self-employment. Four aspects of financial capability have been examined: the
     planning and management of current cash flows, the planning and management of
     future cash flows, responsibility for management of the household’s cash flows, and
     interactions with financial institutions.




     5.1.	 Managing Current Household Cash Flows
     Planning and Budgeting Household Cash Flows
     Household Plans and Budgets

     Most households (60 percent) reported planning how income would be used. However,
     most households (55–75 percent) that reported planning the use of income also
     reported the plan was only a ‘rough plan’. In addition, most households (70 percent)
     only planned sometimes and less than a quarter of households stated they always
     kept to the plan. Households in urban communities and those receiving formal
     sector wages or salary were more likely to report planning cash flows (75 percent of
     households) than rural households and households receiving informal sector income
     as the primary source of income (55 percent of households), and were more likely to
     state that management of cash flow was always planned (50 percent of households).

     Overall, whilst many households considered they planned cash flows; in effect
     households that planned typically did so informally and intermittently. A similar picture
     emerges in respect to household budgeting. Between 40 percent and 70 percent of

households reported the household had a budget to manage household cash flows.
Households living in urban communities and engaged in the formal sector employment
were more likely to budget. However, most budgets were not written down.

In general, it appears most households in Morobe and Madang endeavour to plan and
budget household cash flows. Planning and budgeting is therefore an activity which is
acknowledged as important. However most plans and budgets appear to be general
and are neither written down nor usually adhered to.


Planning Horizon

There was a difference in the planning horizon between respondents whose
primary source of income was formal sector employment and respondents whose
primary source of income was informal or self-employment. As shown in Figure 22
approximately 25 percent of respondents stated they planned ahead six months (or
more) and 12–14 percent of respondents stated they planned several months ahead.
The planning horizon appears to be influenced by the income cycle. Respondents who
derived their income principally from formal sector employment were more likely to
adopt a planning horizon spanning a week or several weeks. This is likely to coincide
with the wage or salary cycle. By contrast respondents who derived their principal
income from the informal sector were more likely to state they did not plan ahead.

                                   Responsibility for Management of the Household Budget

                                   In most households at least one person accepted responsibility for management
                                   of the household budget. Less than 2 percent of households stated no one was
                                   responsible for the management of the household budget. Men appear to be more
                                   engaged in planning and budgeting household cash flows than women and were
                                   more likely to state they were responsible for the management of the household
                                   budget than women. Overall 88 percent of men, compared to 57 percent of women
                                   stated they were responsible for the household budget, either solely responsible or
                                   with their partner. Women were 2.5–3.0 times more likely than men to say they did
                                   not plan ahead. The lower level of engagement by women in the management of
                                   household finances is consistent across all aspects of financial capability examined by
                                   the financial capability study. It is not simply that women are less likely to own a bank
                                   account than men, but that, overall, women are less engaged in the management of
                                   money than men. Confidence with the use of English in communication and primary
                                   source of employment may contribute to a lower level of formal financial product
                                   ownership. However, irrespective of, for example, primary source of income, women
                                   appear to have a subordinate role in the management of household finances.


                                   Management of Household Expenditure
                                   Management of Cash Surplus

                                   Slightly more than half of the households stated they had money left over after meeting
                                   household expenses at least some of the time. Households with formal sector income
                                   were more likely to state the household has a surplus than households which did not
                                   earn formal sector wages or salary (87 percent of households earning formal sector
                                   income, compared to 64 percent of households with only informal sector income). The
                                   pattern was similar for urban and rural households, and for men and women.

                                   Households typically saved the surplus to provide for unforeseen expenses for
                                   example emergencies or medical fees (30–50 percent of households), or for food and
                                   other necessary items (30–45 percent of households). Households also spent the
                                   surplus on food and other necessary items (20–35 percent of households. Interestingly,
                                   20 percent of households earning formal sector income stated the surplus was used
                                   to support other family members.


                                   Management of Cash Deficit

                                   By contrast 80–90 percent of households reported running short of money after
                                   meeting household expenses. Households which only had informal sector income
                                   were likely to state the house ran short of funds. As shown in Table 17, a range
                                   of causes were cited. All households cited a range of expenditure related causes.
                                   Households whose principal source of income was informal sector or self-employed

also, not surprisingly, cited income related causes. However, only 4 percent of
rural households cited the inability to get to the market as a principal cause of
cash shortage. Failure to plan was one of the most commonly cited causes of the
household running short of money.

The most common action taken when the household ran short of funds was to borrow
money from family or friends, ‘sell something’ (particularly rural households) or to simply
go without essentials. Between 17–30 percent of households earning formal sector
income also stated they would borrow from a money lender, or from their employer.

Overall, there appears to be a different pattern used by urban and rural households in
respect to funding cash shortfalls. All households stated they would seek to borrow
from family or friends. Urban households tended to also state they would borrow money,
whereas rural households tended to state they would seek to earn more money.

Overall, however the use of credit to pay for food or other necessary items because
the household had run short of money was common. Between 50–60 percent of
households, irrespective of location or primary source of income, reported using credit
or borrowing money to buy food if there was a cash shortfall.

The pattern of urban households being more willing to borrow money to manage cash
shortfalls is also reflected in the use by urban households of credit to repay existing
debts. Thirty percent (30 percent) of urban households stated they borrowed money to

                                   be borrowed than rural households. Men were more likely to state they borrowed to
                                   pay existing debts, reflective perhaps of the greater control exercised by men over
                                   household cash flows and financial obligations

                                   There is a perceptual difference in the ability to borrow additional funds. As shown in
                                   Table 18, urban households earning formal sector wages or salary tended to consider
                                   they or their household could borrow more money if required and were less likely than
                                   rural households to consider the household had borrowed more money than could be
                                   afforded.

                                   Overall, women appear to be less confident about household borrowing than men.
                                   Sixty percent (60 percent) of women considered they or their household had borrowed
                                   to the limit, compared to 25–35 percent of men.


                                   Knowledge of Cash Position and Spending

                                   As shown in Figure 23, there is a difference between urban and township households
                                   (which have a higher proportion of adults earning formal sector income) and rural
                                   households (which earn primarily informal income). In addition to being more likely
                                   to plan ahead, urban households appear to be more likely to know the household’s
                                   cash position and how much has been spent, both individually and in respect to the
                                   household generally. This is indicative of a pattern: households in urban or township
                                   communities are more focused on money, and within this context the monitoring and
                                   management of money, than rural households.

                                   Respondents were asked how disciplined they considered they were at managing
                                   money. This is not a measure of self-discipline per se, but an indication of respondent’s
                                   confidence in their ability to control their management of money. Three aspects of
                                   self-discipline were considered: how disciplined the respondent was at managing

money generally, whether the respondent learned from other’s mistakes at managing
their money, and the respondent’s propensity to spend on unnecessary items.

The pattern of responses was similar: most adults considered they were very
disciplined at managing money; that they learned from other’s mistakes and only
rarely, or at most occasionally, that they bought things they knew were not necessary
before buying essentials, or bought unnecessary items even when they knew they
could not afford the item. Urban respondents tended to regard themselves as more
disciplined than rural respondents. Men tended to regard themselves as more
disciplined than women did, and less likely to purchase unnecessary items.




5.2.	 Planning Future Household Cash flows
Three aspects of the planning future household cash flows were examined: planning
for major future expenses (both expected and unexpected), planning for the children’s
future and planning for older age.


Planning for Major Future Expenditure
Expected Future Expenses

About half of the households surveyed stated they expected to incur a major expense
(equivalent to at least one month’s household income) at some time over the coming
year. Households in urban communities, in particular households earning formal sector
wages or salary as a primary source of income were more likely than rural households


                                                                                                                   59

                                   to state the expense could be met without borrowing (50–60 percent of urban
                                   households compared to 40 percent of rural households). Households with a savings
                                   account were slightly more likely to state the expense could be met without recourse
                                   to borrowing.

                                   Most households which stated the expense could not be met without borrowing also
                                   stated they had not done anything to be able to meet the expense (50–60 percent
                                   of households). There was little difference in responses between men and women,
                                   although women were more likely to state they were worried about meeting the
                                   expense. Rural households were also more likely to express concern about their ability
                                   to meet the expense.


                                   Unexpected Future Expenses

                                   Overall, 70 percent of households stated they would not be able to cover a major
                                   unexpected expense without borrowing. Most households (77 percent) had not done
                                   anything to be able to meet an unexpected major expense.

                                   Whilst ownership of a savings account did not appear to be a significant factor in
                                   household’s ability to meet expected expenses, households with a savings account
                                   were more likely to state the household could pay a major unexpected expense
                                   (equivalent to at least one month’s household income) without having to borrow
                                   money. Seventeen percent (17 percent) of households that did not own a savings
                                   account stated they expected to be able to cover the expense, compared to 35 percent
                                   of households with a savings account. Nearly all households (90 percent) expressed
                                   concern about the household’s ability to cover a major unexpected expense.


                                   Planning for Children’s Future

                                   Households typically had been between 3–3.5 dependent children. Rural households
                                   tended to have slightly larger families than urban households. Respondents were
                                                                                                                  40
                                   asked if the household had planned, or was planning for the children’s future.
                                   Most households reported planning for their children’s future in some way. Urban
                                   households were more likely to report they were planning than rural households
                                   (90 percent of urban households compared to 70 percent of rural households).
                                   Households which were planning for their children’s future typically used more than
                                   one form of provision. Table 20 shows the percentage of households which reported
                                   using each strategy (‘cited‘) and for each strategy the percentage of respondents who
                                   also reported using other means of provision for the children’s future. As shown in

 way




Table 19 the most common form of planning for the children’s future was to save, in
particular to save for the children’s education. One third of households stated they
were planning for the children’s future in an unspecified way. However, over half of
these households also reported saving for education. The second most common
strategy was also savings based (saving money to pass on to the children).

As shown in Table 20, most households used cash based provision for the children’s
future. Similar to the longer planning horizon adopted for the management of
household cash flows by households with formal sector wages or salary as a principal
source of income, these households were more likely to cite longer term strategies
(investment) than households which relied on informal sector income or self-
employment.

                                   Planning for Older Age

                                   The generic financial competency survey includes a section examining the strategies
                                   used to plan for older age when the respondent is no longer working due to age. The
                                   section has two paths: one for respondents under the age of sixty, the second for
                                   respondents over the age of sixty. The difference in the paths being that the questions
                                   for respondents over the age of sixty assume the respondent is no longer working.
                                   It was acknowledged during the development of the instrument that the use of a
                                   common age for ‘retirement’ was somewhat arbitrary.

                                   This approach used by the generic financial capability survey to developing an
                                   understanding of planning for older age is problematic for PNG for two reasons. Firstly,
                                                                                                  41
                                   life expectancy in PNG is 60 years men and 65 years women, with the probability
                                   of dying between 15–60 years of 31.9 percent for men and 24.3 percent for women.
                                   In absolute terms, therefore, the number of Papua New Guineans over the age the
                                   sixty is likely to be very low. This has been the case with the survey in Morobe and
                                   Madang provinces. Only 5.4 percent of respondents were 60 years or older. Secondly,
                                   and perhaps more importantly within the context of many Pacific island countries, the
                                   concept of retirement is derived primarily from the emergence of formal employment
                                   and social security in Europe. Retirement provision has become an important policy
                                   issue in many developed countries, in particular countries with an aging population
                                   and in which most adults earn salary or wage income and the state typically makes
                                   some form of provision for citizen’s old age. However, the concept of ‘retirement’
                                   from the workforce does not have the same meaning in the context of Morobe and
                                   Madang in which most people live in a rural community which has a high subsistence
                                   and self-generated income component and have no expectation of becoming eligible
                                   for a pension, whether state or private provision, at a specified age. There is currently
                                   only one old age social pension scheme in PNG, the pension scheme provided by New
                                   Ireland province for residents sixty years and older. The provident funds in PNG are
                                   solely for wage and salary earners.

                                   Typically in Papua New Guinea, people must work until they are no longer able to work.
                                   The generic English language question used by the survey is; ”what strategies do you
                                   have for meeting your/your household’s expenses in your old age?” The issue is not

                                   work due to age. The question used for no longer working used the following To Pisin

                                   Overall, a significant percentage of respondents stated they had no strategies to meet

age. Forty four percent (44 percent) of respondents had no strategy and therefore did
not know how they would meet expenses when they were no longer able to work.

Table 21 shows respondents’ expected means of meeting expenses when they can
no longer work due to age. The table shows the percentage of respondents who
reported each expected strategy (‘cited‘) and for each strategy cited the percentage
of respondents who reported they also expected to use other strategies to meet
expenses. As shown in Table 22 most respondents expect to use multiple sources to
fund their expenses. The issues associated with the concept of ‘not working’ can be
seen in the pattern of responses. The most common response was that respondents
expected to earn income from a business. As shown in Table 23 this response was
frequently provided by men who derived their principal source of income from
the informal sector or self-employment and who already earned business income.
Approximately one quarter of respondents expected to receive support from others.
The combination of financial support and business income were the most common
strategies respondents expected to use to fund expenses when they were no
longer working.

Most respondents stated the strategies they expected to use to fund expenses when
they were no longer working were already in place. As shown in Table 22, there were
important differences in the pattern of responses. Respondents whose principal
source of income was informal sector were significantly less likely to state they would
use savings or long term savings (for example provident fund) to meet expenses.
Men were significantly more likely to state they would use an inheritance to meet
expenses. The reasons why only men stated they would be able to access inheritance

                                   were not explored by the survey. It is possible this is due to societies in Morobe
                                   and Madang being primarily patriarchal (which may also explain the higher level of
                                   business income cited by men).

                                   As shown in Figure 24, respondents who earned formal sector wages or salary were
                                   more likely to consider the strategies they expected to use to fund themselves and
                                   their household when they are no longer working would provide for all expenses.
                                   Less than 50 percent of those earning informal sector incomes expected to be able
                                   to meet expenses. Women expressed particular concern. Less than a third of women
                                   considered they would be able to meet expenses when they were no longer working.
                                   Overall respondents earning formal sector income were significantly less worried
                                   about meeting expenses. Twenty four percent (24 percent) stated they were very
                                   worried about meeting expenses, compared to 45 percent of respondents earning
                                   informal sector income or self-employment.

                                   Approximately 4.6 percent of the Papua New Guinea population is aged 60 years
                                   and older (World Bank, 2013c). Assuming a similar percentage of the working age
                                   population has no strategy to fund their expenses when they are no longer working
                                   as has been found for Morobe and Madang, it is likely that approximately 1.9m adult
                                   Papua New Guineans do not know how they will meet their expenses in old age. It is

estimated the population aged 60+ in Melanesian countries will rise to 7.2 percent by
2025 (Hayes, 2009). Assuming a population growth rate for PNG of 1.89 percent p.a.,
this suggests that this figure could rise to approximately 2.3m Papua New Guineans by
2025. Funding expenses in retirement appears to be an emerging policy issue for PNG,
in particular for adults living in rural areas. The frequently made assumption that family
or clan groups will provide for the elderly may no longer be appropriate.




5.3.	Responsibility for Household Financial
     Management
Adults in Morobe and Madang who are responsible for making financial decisions on
behalf of their households are more likely to state they are responsible (either solely
or with someone else in the household—usually their partner) for the management
of shorter term rather than longer term or less certain expenditure. As shown in
Figure 25, the further out the expenditure horizon, or the less certain the expenditure,
the greater the likelihood the respondent will state that either their partner is
responsible for the expenditure, or that no one is responsible.

Men are significantly more likely to state they are responsible for the management of
all aspects of household finances than women (refer to Figure 26). There is no major
difference in responses relative to the respondent’s confidence at communicating in
English, to the respondent’s principal source of income, or whether the respondent
lived in a rural or urban household: men dominate the management of household
finances. Women living in rural households are even less likely to state they are
responsible for the management of household finances than women living in urban

5.4.	 Financial Knowledge
The financial knowledge required to effectively use formal financial services and
to manage cash flows is a complex topic. The scope and complexity of financial
knowledge required by financial services consumers is related to the level of
engagement with the formal financial system. Evidence from the present study
indicates there a wide range of levels of engagement with the formal financial
system, ranging from very limited engagement by many households in rural areas,
particularly rural communities with limited access to finance points, to multi-faceted
engagement by households whose principal source of income is formal sector salary
and who regularly use electronic transaction services, savings, long term savings
(including provident or superannuation), and formal credit (including, importantly,
secured credit).

Two fundamental aspects of financial knowledge required by financial services
consumers irrespective of their level of engagement with the formal financial sector
have been examined: the process used to select financial services products and
services and understanding of the cost of financial services.


Selection of Financial Products

In respect to the selection of financial services products and services, several aspects
of the selection process are critical: whether consumers seek to find a product which
best met their needs, whether information is sought about the product from a range of
sources not just the financial services product provider, whether alternative products
were considered and whether consumers checked the terms and conditions prior to
committing to purchase the product.

The range of financial products and services available to urban customers is more
extensive than that available to rural customers. In addition, the ability to be able to
seek information and to consider terms and conditions is influenced by functional
English literacy. As shown in Figure 27, urban consumers who are confident in their
ability to communicate in English appear to be more likely to search for information
from a range of sources, to consider product alternatives in order to find the product
that best meets their needs and to check terms and conditions before purchasing the
product. Consumers who are not confident in their ability to communicate in English
are less likely to be critical in their product selection and are very likely to purchase a
product without reviewing the terms and conditions, irrespective of whether they live
in an urban or rural community.

Limited ability to communicate in English creates vulnerability in product selection.
The present study has not examined consumer protection as this is still developing
in PNG. However it is evident there are significant levels of potential consumer

                                   Understanding the Cost of Financial Services

                                   Understanding the cost of money is a fundamental financial capability, irrespective
                                   of the consumer’s level of engagement with financial institutions (whether formal
                                   institutions or informal institutions). As shown in Table 23, most adults in Morobe and
                                   Madang do not know how much interest has been paid on borrowing, how much
                                   interest has been earned on savings and, in respect to formal financial institutions,
                                   the fees paid for financial services. This also suggests there may be considerable
                                   vulnerability in the use of financial services by adults in Morobe and Madang and,
                                   related to this, significant risk of exploitation.

5.5.	 Managing Relationships with Financial
      Institutions
Most people (66 percent) stated they never went anywhere when they needed to seek
financial advice. Those who had sought financial advice reported seeking advice from
a broad range of sources. Approximately a quarter of those who had sought advice
reported seeking advice from a bank or other financial services professional. Other
sources of advice included family, friends or spouse.

Few people (10 percent) reported having had a dispute with a financial services
provider. Most people who had had a dispute did not endeavour to resolve the issue
with the financial institution providing the product. They reported either doing nothing
or talking to family or friends.

The potential vulnerability of financial services consumers in Morobe and Madang is
further underscored by the limited understanding of the risks associated with the use
of financial services providers. Eighty one percent (81 percent) of adults stated they
had never tried to find out about the risks of using the financial services providers
they currently use or previously used. Overall most financial services consumers
do not appear to search for financial services, check product terms and conditions,
understand the cost of the financial services they are using or the risks of the financial
services providers whose products they use and do not seek financial advice.




5.6.	 Findings Relative to Other Financial
      Capability Studies
The financial capability study in Morobe and Madang is the only financial capability
population study undertaken to date in a Pacific island country. There have been
several other studies which had had a more limited scope and have focused on poor
and low income households. The studies were undertaken by central banks in Samoa,
Fiji, the Solomon Islands and PNG, with the support of the Pacific Financial Inclusion
Programme (UN-PFIP).

The focus of the Pacific island studies was similar to the present study in that the
studies sought to understand levels of financial inclusion, financial knowledge and
skill and financial behaviour. The methodology was slightly different. The studies
sought firstly to understand the financial competencies adults in low income
households, who made financial decisions on behalf of their households, considered
they needed to have in order to manage their household’s finances effectively, and
to then measure the extent to which adults were able to demonstrate competence.
A common competency set (Sibley & Liew, 2011) was used for the studies, as similar

Financial inclusion and financial capability in morobe and madang provinces Papua New Guinea



                                   competencies were considered to be necessary by low income households in each
                                   country. The PNG Financial competency study examined the financial competence of
                                   low income households in several settlements in Port Moresby, villages in Mekeo and
                                   Galley Reach.

                                   The findings from the studies are broadly similar across countries and with the
                                   findings from the present study:

                                      ■■    Most low income households owned few financial products. Financial
                                            products owned were principally savings products. There was very limited
                                            use of formal credit.

                                      ■■    Rural households were significantly less likely to own formal financial
                                            products and services than urban households and exhibited lower levels of
                                            financial capability/financial competence. The findings of the PNG financial
                                            competence study in respect differences in the level of bank account
                                            ownership were similar to the findings from the present study.

                                      ■■    In Fiji (in respect to both iTaukei and Indo-Fijian households), the Solomon
                                            Islands and PNG, women were consistently less likely to be involved in the
                                            management of household finances (other than the management of day-day
                                            expenditure) and were less likely to own formal financial services.

                                      ■■    Many adults did not know how they would meet expenses when they were
                                            no longer working—other than relying on their children or family or friends.

                                      ■■    The overall level of financial knowledge was low and most adults had very
                                            limited understanding of the cost of financial services.

                                   There was a significant difference in the use of informal store credit reported by the
                                   financial competence studies compared to the present study. Use of store credit,
                                   in particular the use of store credit by rural households, was typically at least twice
                                   the level reported for Morobe and Madang (32–36 percent compared to 15 percent
                                   for Morobe and Madang). The reasons for the difference level in the use of store
                                   credit may be, as previously discussed, due to lack of understanding that deferred
                                   purchase of goods is a form of credit. It is also possible that the difference in the
                                   respective geographic and population scope of the studies may result in lower levels
                                   of store credit being found by the present study. The Morobe Madang study includes
                                   a significantly broader range of households, in particular households earning formal
                                   sector income, than the PFIP studies and also has a wider geographic spread of
                                   sampling locations. It is also possible that store credit is not prevalent in Morobe and
                                   Madang and that a greater use of store credit will be found in other locations as the
                                   national financial capability study progresses.

6.  Implications for Policy
and Strategy


The findings from the study of financial inclusion and financial capability in Morobe
and Madang are discussed in relation to the Maya Declaration Goals which form
the basis for financial inclusion and financial literacy policy in PNG and provide the
framework for developing strategies and implementing programmes to increase
financial inclusion and financial capability in PNG.

This chapter does not make recommendations in respect to possible changes to the
National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy. The scope of the present
study is limited to Morobe and Madang and it is not appropriate to suggest change or
development to a national strategy based on a survey of two provinces. However, on
the basis the findings from the present study are likely to be indicative of the situation
in other provinces; potential implications for the achievement of the Maya Declaration
Goals are discussed.

New Guinea, 50 percent of whom will be women


Situation in Morobe and Madang

The study of financial inclusion in Morobe and Madang has found a significant
difference between urban and rural communities. This is consistent with the findings
from the financial competency study in Central province. Evidence from Morobe
and Madang suggests levels of financial inclusion in urban communities may be
approaching, or may be at levels found in other developing countries. The study also
suggests urban households, in particular households in which the principal source
of income is formal sector wages or salary, are engaging with the formal financial
system across a broad range of product groups, extending beyond savings/transaction
accounts to long term savings and formal credit. By contrast levels of financial
inclusion in rural communities, across all product groups, are very low.

The study has also found a significant difference between levels of financial inclusion
for men and women, particularly in urban communities. Access to financial services
appears to have resulted in increased levels of financial inclusion primarily for men.
Women in urban communities are significantly more likely to have a bank account
than women in rural communities and may be accessing financial services indirectly


                                                                                             71

                                   by accessing a bank account owned or controlled by a male. However, relative levels
                                   of financial exclusion by women living in urban communities are significantly higher
                                   than those found in rural communities.


                                   Implications for Policy and Practice

                                   Households need access to financial services infrastructure. Most households in PNG
                                   are rural. The findings from the present study suggest that many rural communities,
                                   effectively, have no or very limited access to formal financial services. It is possible
                                   the Maya Declaration Goal may be achievable in urban communities. However, the
                                   findings from Morobe and Madang suggest that, without major development to the
                                   rural financial services infrastructure, bringing large numbers of currently financially
                                   excluded Papua New Guineans into the formal financial system will not be possible.

                                   Increasing access to financial services does not appear to benefit women to the
                                   same extent as men. If the finding from the study in Morobe and Madang is found
                                   to be the case across PNG, it is likely that, unless there is a substantive change to
                                   financial inclusion programmes, and within this context possibly also products and
                                   services (whether public or private sector), the goal of gender equity will probably
                                   not be achieved and the gender gap may even be further exacerbated. Further
                                   investigation is required to understand why women are less likely to own any form of
                                   formal financial service, even when the financial service is accessible and likely to be
                                   affordable.

                                   Papua New Guineans through financial education and financial literacy


                                   Situation in Morobe and Madang

                                   Most households in Morobe and Madang appear to endeavour to plan and budget
                                   cash flows. However, for most households, irrespective of whether the household
                                   receives regular formal sector wages or salary, or more unpredictable informal sector
                                   or self-employed income, plans and budgets are typically informal, focused only on
                                   major items and are not documented. Whilst most households may consider they are
                                   planning cash flows, in effect the household has priorities for spending.

                                   Overall, households in urban communities, in particular households which receive
                                   regular wages or salary, are more likely to pro-actively manage household finances.
                                   This is not surprising as these households engage with the money economy on a daily
                                   basis, across a broad range of financial activities. Money is embedded in the life of
                                   urban households to a greater extent than in many rural households. It tempting to
                                   regard the lower level of money management by rural households as evidence rural
                                   households have lower levels of financial capability. This may not, however, necessarily




   72
                                                                                                Implications for Policy and Strategy



be the case. Capability is relative to financial activity and it is possible rural households
do not need the same level of financial knowledge and skill as is required by urban
households.

Irrespective of location or source of income, women are less involved in all aspects
of household financial management measured by the study than men and have less
responsibility for the aspects management of household finances measured by the
study than men. Whilst many respondents stated household finances were managed
jointly, in effect the management of household finances in Morobe and Madang
appears to be dominated by men. The financial competence study in Central province
found a similar pattern of responsibility.

Many adults, in particular rural households and women, do not know how they will
fund their and their household’s expenses when they are no longer working. Access
to provident schemes and formal financial services promotes savings. However, for
most adults in Morobe and Madang (and potentially PNG generally), there is little
opportunity to make progressive provision for old age.



Implications for Policy and Practice

As the study of financial capability in PNG progresses, it may be appropriate to consider
the development of rural and urban capability indices in addition to a national index.

Given the likelihood that budgeting and planning household cash flows is not common
across households in PNG, the focus on budgeting and planning which is a common
feature of financial literacy programmes would appear to be appropriate. As the
use of formal credit expands (and evidence from the present study indicates that
formal sector employment may facilitate the use of formal sector credit), inclusion
of responsible borrowing modules in financial literacy programmes may also be
warranted. It is also suggested that consideration may need to be given to including
longer term savings or asset accumulation modules in order to increase awareness
of the need to prepare to older age and how gradual longer term savings can be
achieved.

Findings from the present study and the financial competence study suggest there
may be a requirement for financial literacy programmes specifically for women.

Increasing formal employment and monetisation will inevitably result in an increasing
need for Papua New Guineans to provide for their old age. If the findings from the
study in Morobe and Madang are replicated across PNG, it is possible that the scope
of financial inclusion programmes may need to expand to include longer term
planning and the preparation for old age when it is no longer possible to work. In a
wider context, the ability to meet expenses in old age is an emergent policy issue in

                                   completed, may provide a useful input to the policy discussion.

                                   Situation in Morobe and Madang

                                   Branch, ATM and EFTPOS networks in PNG are largely urban. This is the case for
                                   Morobe and Madang. Agent networks do not, at this time, appear to be sufficiently
                                   dense to enable most rural households to readily access formal financial services.

                                   Mobile phone telephony appears to be an important component of extending financial
                                   services, in particular to rural communities. However, in Morobe and Madang, there
                                   appears to be a significant difference between rural and urban communities in respect
                                   to adults’ capacity to use the mobile phone, and by extension the potential capacity
                                   to use the mobile phone for financial services. Levels of mobile phone ownership,
                                   combined with adults’ ability to use the mobile phone to text as well as to make
                                   calls, suggest mobile phone banking has significant short term potential in urban
                                   communities, and rural communities with access to cell-phone telephony.


                                   Implications for Policy and Practice

                                   Developing extensive branch networks or even extensive ATM networks in rural areas
                                   is not an option for PNG. Other than BSP Rural, commercial financial services providers
                                   are not expanding services into rural areas but are focusing on urban communities.
                                   It may be appropriate to consider the development of a financial services delivery
                                   architecture for rural communities in PNG. Alternative delivery channels are likely to
                                   be required.

                                   There appears to be broad acceptance that the mobile phone has a key role in
                                   expanding financial inclusion in PNG and BPNG has been pro-active in facilitating a
                                   supportive regulatory environment. Whilst there is some evidence of a correlation
                                   between access to formal financial services and financial inclusion, the findings from
                                   the present study suggest that an approach based on ‘build it and they will come’
                                   may not be appropriate for mobile phone based financial services. The combination of
                                   more limited ownership or access to a mobile phone and mobile phone capability in
                                   rural communities, in particular for women, suggests the expansion of mobile phone
                                   based financial services (as opposed to the use of mobile telephony to deliver agent
                                   based financial services) in rural areas may require concurrent capacity building

Situation in Morobe and Madang

Financial services consumers in Morobe and Madang appear to have a limited
understanding of the cost of the financial services they use. Many consumers, in
particular consumers who are not confident in communicating in English, do not search
for information about financial services before committing to buy a product, they do not
consider alternatives or look at alternative products and, perhaps most importantly, they
frequently do not check terms and conditions of the products they purchase. The financial
competence study in Central province found a similar low level of critical purchase
behaviour and limited understanding of the cost of formal financial services used.


Implications for Policy and Practice

Findings from the present study, and the earlier study in Central province, suggest
consumer awareness is limited for many adults and there is therefore potential
vulnerability to predatory practices. This not only exposes households to the risk of
high interest and fee charges, but also creates a potentially significant vulnerability to
financial scams. Whilst few households appear to have had a dispute with a financial
services institution, findings from the present study suggest a platform to monitor
consumer protection is likely to be warranted.

Goal: To begin the process of integrating financial inclusion in local and national
government, including getting the National Executive Council to endorse the
National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy by quarter 4 of 2013

The focus of the present study is not relevant for this goal.

Goal: To promote regular collection and use of financial access data to inform
policy making and help identify key dimensions of financial inclusion in Papua
New Guinea


Situation in Morobe and Madang

BPNG has been implementing a programme to collect enhanced supply-side data.
Collection of field data, in particular field work in rural communities, can pose significant
challenges. The reasons for the challenges are well known. Nevertheless, there is a
very real need to better understand financial exclusion in PNG and financial capability.
Despite initial challenges, the present study has been successful in collecting field data,
including field data from remote communities, at an acceptable cost.


Implications for Policy and Practice

Findings from the present study have contributed to the understanding of financial
inclusion and financial capability in PNG. The findings are not, however, national. It

                                   The focus of the present study is not relevant for this goal, other than the

Appendix 1: Overview of Districts

Morobe Province

Morobe province is divided into nine (9) districts, including Lae (refer to Map 4). The
survey was conducted in six (6) of these districts, namely Menyamya, Huon Gulf,
Bulolo, Finschafen, Markham, and Lae.


Lae

Lae city had a reported population of 148,934 in the 2011 Census, and is, as stated,
the hub of much of the Momase and Highlands region. It is the largest port in the
South Pacific, by far, outside Australia and New Zealand, with a major recent upgrade,
notably with ADB financing support. As well as serving as export port for the Highlands
and Markham/Ramu agricultural industry, and the mines of Porgera, Hidden Valley
and smaller projects (and major prospective projects, such as Wafi-Golpu), it has also
been the main import terminal for the construction of the facilities in the Highlands,

                                   including for the Kutubu oil fields, Porgera and more recently the PNG LNG project,
                                   based in Hela province. It is the country’s main manufacturing centre (from fish
                                   processing to plastic containers, metal work, engineering, milling and bottling) and
                                   service centre for Morobe and the wider region, as well as a seat of learning, with the
                                   University of Technology, polytechnic, teacher training and other colleges, and research
                                   facilities, notably for forestry. The population, as indicated, comes from the local (e.g.
                                   Ahi) community and adjoining areas within the province, with the city developing
                                   from the traditional villages, such as Butibum, but also reinforced with in-migration
                                   from across the Momase and Highlands regions, and in smaller numbers from the
                                   New Guinea islands, notably neighbouring West New Britain, and neighbouring Oro
                                   province, for which Lae is also the main trading centre, with products such as betel
                                   nut shipped constantly to the Lae market. This cosmopolitan mix coexists in the city
                                   and its settlements in relative harmony, although certain conflicts do arise, particularly
                                   between certain communities, fuelled by factors such as alcohol, but also land issues,
                                   high crime levels, and indirectly by the high cost of living in recent years in the city,
                                   and fluctuating, but inadequate formal sector job prospects.


                                   Menyamya

                                   The remote and mountainous district of Menyamya, with its population (recorded at
                                   87,209 in 2011), has long remained one of the most inaccessible and disadvantaged
                                   areas in Papua New Guinea (along with its neighbouring vicinities, and tribal affiliates,
                                   in Marawaka District in the Eastern Highlands province and the Kaintiba area in Gulf
                                   province). Menyamya District has enjoyed a surfaced road to Menyamya station
                                   and Aseki in the past, but this has deteriorated, and much of the rest of the district
                                   is inaccessible by road, notably in the wet season, when much of the survey was
                                   conducted. The multiple airstrips formerly operating in the district are now closed,
                                   except Menyamya’s, which only takes charter services. There is some smallholder
                                   coffee production in the district, with a small processing factory in Aseki, but poor
                                   transport access has undermined this income earning activity, with much produce
                                   recorded as un-harvested. During nutrition surveys in the 1980s this was an area with
                                   a high prevalence of malnutrition (notably stunting—National Nutrition Survey 1982/3),
                                   including goitre amongst 8–11 year old in schools (from lack of iodine) still in the 2000s
                                   (WHO Global Database on Iodine Deficiency, 2007).


                                   Huon Gulf

                                   Huon Gulf is the province’s largest district by area, and stretches nearly the length
                                   of the province, including the extensive lowlands and coastal areas in the lower
                                   Markham floodplain and southern Morobe coast, but flanked to the south by, and
                                   including some of the mountain ranges, notably the Bowotu range, stretching east

to the border with Oro province. Its population (recorded as 77,564 in 2011) also
makes it one of the larger districts in the province, although containing no significant
towns (with City of Lae effectively as its hub). Much of the district has relatively good
accessibility, with most of the population able to reach roads or travel by boat to
markets or service centres within a day’s travel, although seasonally sea, road or river
travel (e.g. along the turbulent Watut river) can be hazardous. Communities in the
Engati area, adjoining Menyama District, are the most isolated and disadvantaged,
along with some inland communities in the mountains from the Morobe coast.
Economic activities derive from sales of fresh produce, betel nut and some fish to the
Lae market, especially, and modest production of cocoa and coconuts from the lower
Markham valley and employment on livestock estates and outgrower sales of poultry.
There is a little income and employment related to tourism and forestry along the
southern coast, around Salamaua and to the east.


Bulolo

The Bulolo District is the most populous in the province, after Lae city, with 101,568
recorded in the 2011 Census. It includes the Bulolo and Snake River valleys and part
of the Watut, and the Waria valley around the former tea growing area of Garaina
in the south east. The district includes the larger townships of Wau and Bulolo and
the Hidden Valley Gold mine and extensive areas of alluvial gold mining, exploration
and panning the river systems. These and the former coffee estates have provided
opportunities, even going back to the 1920s, for immigration from other parts of PNG
(mostly from Momase and the Highlands provinces). Some coffee is still produced in
the district, along with plantation pine (auracaria) timber and associated processing,
whilst a variety of fresh produce is grown for market in the cooler upland valleys,
especially. Most of the larger valleys (normally) have relatively good access to main
centres, markets and basic services, except the remote Waria valley, where the former
tea production around Garaina has long ceased. Malnutrition rates (notably stunting)
recorded in the district during the 1982–83 National Nutrition Survey were relatively
high compared with most of the province, but below the rates in the adjoining, and
relatively more inaccessible, Menyama District.


Finschafen

Finschafen District, which recorded a population of 54,673 in the 2011 Census,
comprises a narrow coastal plain and small offshore (Tami) islands, rising up to
the high Cromwell mountain range, and its relatively remote highland valleys. The
population is spread across the coastal plain, including township of Finschhafen, and
the station of Pindiu and multiple mountain villages. Some cash cropping, including
coffee and spices, occurred in the past, but poor access, including cessation of rural

                                   air-services and deterioration of rural roads has undermined opportunities beyond
                                   subsistence agricultural away from the coastal strip. The discontinuation of coastal
                                   shipping services has also undermined business opportunities and required access by
                                   relatively unsafe small craft. Some recent restoration of certain bridges and stretches
                                   of access roads may provide the prospects of renewed access to trade and services
                                   for some inland rural communities.


                                   Markham

                                   The Markham District, with a widely dispersed population of 62,495 recorded in the
                                   2011 Census, embraces the main upper portion of the Markham floodplain and a short
                                   stretch of the adjoining Ramu valley, but also extends up on the northern flanks into
                                   the steep valleys, like the Leron and Wantoap, and high mountains of the western
                                   Sarawaget range, merging with the Finisterre range, and in the south into the Kratke
                                   range and valleys, like the Wafu. As in most districts, the highest population densities
                                   are largely in the restricted valleys, and away from the more malaria affected lowland
                                   areas, but poor access to these highland areas has more recently encouraged, as in
                                   other remoter districts, outmigration to cities and main access routes. The Markham
                                   and upper Ramu valleys have been centres in the past for low intensity ranch-style
                                   livestock production, but since the 1980s large tracts have been partly turned over
                                   first to commercial sugar and over the past decade also to oil palm, with large
                                   concentrations of employees, both local, but also from adjoining provinces (notably
                                   Madang, Eastern Highlands and Simbu) also employed long term in these estates and
                                   processing facilities. Production of lowland produce for sale into the neighbouring
                                   Highlands provinces is prevalent in the Markham valley, as well as to Lae city.


                                   Madang Province

                                   Madang is divided into six (6) districts (refer to Map 5), of which 2 were selected for
                                   the survey, namely Sumkar (including Census Units on Karkar island) and Rai Coast
                                   (including a Census Unit on remote Long Island), plus the Madang urban being added,
                                   to supplement the selected sample of (rural) districts and CUs.


                                   Madang

                                   Madang District, including the town had a population of 110,978, as recorded in the
                                   2011 Census. The district covers the town and the lagoon, with its multiple coastal
                                   islands, as well as parts of the Gogol valley and eastern end of the coastal Adelbert
                                   range. The urban area, which now embraces some of the islands, like Kranket, which
                                   are now effectively part of the town, has long been a tourist hub, as well as provincial

limited land within the formal township area, with its extensive lakes and inlets, has
seen a substantial growth in settlements, particularly housing people from across
remoter, including highlands parts of Madang province, plus from across the Momase
region, especially East Sepik and other Highlands provinces. Despite poor soils on
the limestone coastal plain, agricultural potential is reasonable in the hills and Gogol
and other valleys, with access to the urban market for fresh produce able to provide
alternatives for more accessible communities to subsistence production. Planation
forestry the Gogol (for a chip-mill in town) has ceased and most logging concessions in
the district have already exhausted their resource.


Sumkar

Sumkar, includes the highly populated and agriculturally productive volcanic island
of Karkar and its smaller neighbour, Bagabag Island, and also embraces a stretch
of less-fertile adjoining limestone coastal plains, rising up into the lower elevation
coastal mountain range, the Adelberts. Sumkar’s population was recorded as 84,944
in the 2011 Census, with well over half of that on Karkar and Bagabag islands. Karkar
is a major centre for the copra and cocoa industries, with a stream of workboats
transporting raw copra to Madang for processing as coconut oil or directly for export,
as well as cocoa. The island has some of the country’s few still operating copra and
cocoa estates, as well as smallholder production. Some copra and cocoa are also
produced along the coastal plain on the mainland, although many of the estates have
ceased to operate, and robusta coffee production has long since ceased. Although

                                   this district. Apart from parts of the Adelbert hills and mountains, access is mostly
                                   good along the ‘north coast road’, and on Karkar Island, and mostly by small craft
                                   from the islands, although some larger (and generally safer) work boats operate on
                                   these routes. Periodic low prices and outbreaks of pest and diseases, notably cocoa
                                   pod borer (and Bogia syndrome in coconuts) have affected production and household
                                   incomes, which had been relatively high for rural areas. Other cash crops include betel
                                   nuts and some surplus fresh produce for sale in Madang and the Highlands markets,
                                   although Madang is a far smaller hub than Lae, but it does have significant and
                                   growing industries, including tourism, requiring supplies.


                                   Rai Coast

                                   The Rai Coast District recorded a population of 83,218 in the 2011 Census, largely in
                                   the Rai coast rural LLG area within the district. The district covers an extended stretch
                                   of relatively straight coastline commencing in the west from flood plains feeding into
                                   Astrolabe bay and a progressively rising backdrop to the east, with most of the coast
                                   flanked by the Finisterre mountains rising to nearly 4,000 metres, with high population
                                   densities in the relatively inaccessible high valleys. The district includes the active volcanic
                                   Long island, with its large lake-filled caldera, and the small adjoining Crown Island. The
                                   Astrolabe Bay end of the district and into the mountains have high rainfall and a relatively
                                   short dry season, whereas in the rain-shadow of the Finisterre (and Sarawaget) ranges
                                   to the east, there is a long dry season and agricultural opportunities restrained, with
                                   cattle grazing on some of grasslands near Sialum, in Morobe to the east. The western
                                   coastal villages have reasonable access by road, when rivers are crossable, and by boat
                                   to Madang, but travelling to the remoter eastern parts of the district (including to Long
                                   Island, which lies 70 km from the Saidor station, and 130 km from Madang) and inland
                                   from the coast involves many hours of travel on foot or by boat, constrained also by the
                                   discontinuation of most formal coastal passenger, freight and rural air services. During the
                                   wet season, with multiple unbridged rivers, travel is harder and also dangerous by (the
                                   predominant) small craft during extended periods of strong winds.

                                   The Ramu nickel and cobalt mine, located in the Ramu valley, transports the extracted
                                   ore by 100 km slurry pipeline to a preliminary processing plant in the Basimuk Bay
                                   along the Rai coast, from where the product is shipped, with the waste dumped,
                                   controversially, offshore. Economic opportunities are very limited in most of the
                                   district, with a few employed in the port/processing facility, and a little cocoa, copra
                                   (including from old estates near Saidor) and betel nut produced on the coast, although,
                                   with years of low prices and lack of coastal shipping, the copra trade has largely dried
                                   up. Likewise modest vegetable shipments from the inland valleys have dwindled,
                                   leaving subsistence agriculture and coastal fishing as almost the only means of
                                   livelihood for most of the district’s population.

Appendix 2: Overview of Households
Respondents

The survey was completed by the female and male in the household who made most
financial decisions on behalf of the household. Typically this was the husband and
wife. Eighty-seven percent of surveys were completed in households in which both
a woman and man were interviewed. Overall, interviews were evenly distributed
between women and men. Respondent’s mean age was similar, irrespective of
location: 38.63 years for urban respondents and 37.56 years for rural respondents.
The mean female age was 35.8 years and the mean male age 39.9 years. As shown in
Figure 28, the age distribution for women was slightly younger than that for men.


Household Overview
Household Size

The average household size was 6 members. Household size and composition was
similar across rural and urban households. The typical household comprised three
adults and three children. There was an even gender balance (52 percent male and
48 percent female).


Sources of Income

Households reported between 2.3–2.6 sources of income, across rural and urban
households. On average, between 2.3–2.4 household members contributed to
household income. The principal income earners were in most households the
female and male interviewed for the survey. As shown in Table 24, households in
rural communities derived most income from the informal sector or self-employment.

                                   By contrast, in urban and township communities, approximately 50 percent of
                                   households derived most income from formal sector employment. Approximately
                                   15 percent of urban households reported the principal source of income from sources
                                   other than formal employment or informal sector income. Sources of income were
                                   forms of passive income: income from rents and leases, income from investments,
                                   pension income.

                                   For most households, household income varied over the year. Not surprisingly, given
                                   the source of income, a larger percentage of rural households stated income was
                                   variable (89.1 percent) than urban households (60.6 percent). Household income
                                   tended to be variable across both high and low income earning periods. Rural
                                   households were more likely to manage income earned by household members jointly
                                   as a household (60.1 percent of households) than urban households (46.7 percent of
                                   households). Conversely, urban households that earned business income were more
                                   likely to keep the income separate to household income (67.3 percent) than rural
                                   households (37.9 percent).

                                   As shown in Table 25, sources of income were similar for women and men in rural
                                   communities. In urban households, however, men were more likely than women to
                                   report formal sector employment.

analysis. As shown in Table 26, respondents’ estimate of their personal monthly
income and their household’s monthly income increases as the predicted poverty level
of the district reduces.

Overall, men and women estimated similar levels of monthly household income (men:
$579, women $556). However, it appears respondents may have limited awareness of
the income earned by the household. On average respondents estimated they earned
$445 per month and their household earned $569 per month. Estimates of individual
income earned by urban respondents were approximately 2.3x the estimate of income
earned by rural respondents. In rural households men and women estimated similar
levels of individual monthly income. However, in urban and township households
income estimates by men were higher than estimates by women (refer to Table 27).
This is likely to be due to the higher incidence of formal sector employment by men.


Disability

Four percent of households reported a household member with a serious illness
or disability. Information as to the nature of the disability or serious illness was not
sought. Sixty percent of household members who had a serious illness or disability
were under the age of 18 or 60 years or older.

                                   there was confusion between post-secondary education and senior high school or

                                   of urban households in Morobe and Madang have at least one household member
                                   with post-secondary education. Level of education has not been used for the analysis

                                   Dwelling

                                   The assessment of the dwelling was undertaken during enrolment, by a combination
                                   of observation and questions. Houses in urban communities were typically larger
                                   than houses in rural communities (3.7 rooms compared to 3.0 rooms). Houses in
                                   urban communities were constructed primarily from concrete, wood or cement sheet
                                   (65 percent of properties), or corrugated iron (17.5 percent of properties). A further
                                   17.5 percent of properties were constructed from traditional or makeshift materials.
                                   Most properties (89 percent) had an iron roof. In rural communities most houses
                                   were constructed from traditional materials (80 percent) or wood or cement sheet
                                   (13.6 percent of properties). The roof was either traditional materials (66 percent) or
                                   corrugated iron (30 percent). Between 70 percent–80 percent of the dwellings were
                                   assessed by the interviewer undertaking the assessment to be in sound condition and
                                   to be weatherproof. Twenty percent (20 percent) of urban dwellings were assessed as
                                   being in very good condition.

                                   Patterns of land ownership varied. As shown in Table 29, in rural communities
                                   households typically either owned the land on which the house was constructed, or
                                   owned the land communally. In urban communities approximately 31 percent of land
                                   was either owned directly or owned communally. Between 19–47 percent of land in

urban communities appears to be leased. It is not known to what extent the leases are
formal. The mode of land ownership for the remaining 18 percent is not known.

In rural communities 90 percent of dwellings were owned by the household. In urban
communities 46 percent of dwellings were owned by the household, 25 percent were
rented, and 28.5 percent were government, institutional or employer provided housing.


Services

Seventy six percent (76 percent) of rural households had no access to any form of
electricity, 10 percent used solar, 6 percent a generator and 7 percent had access to
mains electricity. By contrast in urban communities 70 percent of households had
mains electricity to the house, 10 percent used solar, 5 percent used a generator and
15 percent had no electricity available.

In rural communities nearly all households (98 percent) reported using wood
for cooking. In urban communities a wider range of forms of cooking was used:
38 percent of households cooked using wood, 28 percent used LPG gas, 29 percent
used electricity and 5 percent used kerosene.

The source of water in urban households was mains pipe. In rural households water
was sourced from a well, spring or river. Ninety four percent (94 percent) of rural
households used a pit latrine toilet, compared to 50 percent in urban households.
Fifty percent (50 percent) of urban households used a flush toilet.


Resources

Nearly all rural households (95 percent) had access to land for food cultivation (either
farm land, communal land or a back-yard). By contrast only 33 percent of urban
households had access to land to cultivate food. Sixty-seven percent (67 percent) of
household did not have access to land to grow food for the household.

                                   1–3 hours, and 63 percent of rural households were at least 3 hours travel from
                                   the provincial capital (11 percent of households were more than 9 hours from the

Appendix 3a: Sampling Notes for PNG National Financial
Capability Survey
John Gibson. 13 November 2013


Summary

Sample selection is based on a stratified four-stage random sample design, with
preliminary counts from the 2011 Census of Population providing the sampling frame.
Stratifying according to female literacy and predicted poverty, the first two stages
selected 19 districts from seven provinces, with probability proportional to estimated
size. The provinces include three from the Highlands (Western Highlands, Jiwaka,
Eastern Highlands), two from Momase (Madang and Morobe), and one each from the
New Guinea Islands (East New Britain) and Papuan (Central) regions. Additionally, the
National Capital District (NCD) is a separate survey strata.

Within each district, five Census Units (CUs) have been selected with probability
proportional to estimated size (PPeS). Within each CU, ten households are to be
selected by the interview teams, using circular systematic sampling. This will yield an
overall sample of 50 households per district and 950 households in total. A further 150
households are to be surveyed from the National Capital District (NCD), with a target
of six households per CU, in 25 CUs that have been selected with a PPeS approach.
Combining the strata, a total of 1100 households are to be surveyed, and in each
household an adult male and adult female are to be interviewed (these should be the
primary financial decision-makers in cases where there is more than one adult of each
gender). Since not all households will have both an adult male and an adult female,
the final sample size will be less than 2200 but should be approximately the sample
of 2000 that survey organizers have indicated is the maximum that is feasible and
affordable.

Survey weights are required to provide nationally representative estimates. These
weights reflect deviations between the actual number of households surveyed per
CU and the target, differences between the preliminary Census count of households
in each CU and the number established during the listing phase of the survey, and
between the preliminary and final Census counts for districts and provinces. The
oversampling of the NCD is also accounted for with the weights.

Surveying in PNG can sometimes be affected by difficulties in accessing locations due
to tribal fighting and other security risks, and more generally due to infrastructure
problems. The survey is expected to be in the field from early 2014 and has only a
few months before fieldwork is meant to be complete. Consequently it may not be
possible to simply wait for an improvement in the circumstances that block access
to locations. In the case of localized disruptions, choosing an alternate CU from the
same district is sufficient, and a list of 19 replacement CUs has been selected (one per


                                                                                              89

                                   selected district) using a PPeS draw. Occasionally the disruption is more widespread
                                   and may block access to an entire district and choosing a replacement in these cases
                                   is a more serious matter (it is varying almost 5 percent of the sample). A ‘nearest
                                   neighbour’ matching approach is proposed, where an unselected district from within
                                   the seven selected provinces with the closest probability of selection to that of the
                                   blocked district is chosen, using a model with predicted poverty and female literacy as
                                   the matching covariates. Any replacement district chosen using this approach will be
                                   identified at the time, by the sampling consultant, and only following the approval of
                                   the task manager and steering committee for the survey.


                                   Sample Constraints

                                   The discussions in Port Moresby with survey organizers indicated that the survey unit
                                   of observation was an individual (adult), that it was desirable to have equal numbers
                                   of men and women, and that the available budget was likely to allow a maximum of
                                   2000 observations. The basis of the calculation of this maximum sample that could
                                   be afforded was not considered, although there are obviously cheaper and dearer
                                   ways to survey 2000 respondents. The survey designer also indicated that spreading
                                   these 2000 observations over a full-scale national survey would be impractical, not
                                   only due to the high fixed costs of only a small sample size in each area but also
                                   because of the limits to supervision capacity, leading to quality control problems, and
                                   the likelihood of disruption in one or more sites from infrastructure problems, tribal
                                   fighting and other security risks. On the other hand it is important that the sample
                                   not degenerate into a limited number of case studies, which might be dismissed
                                   as unrepresentative, and which would not be a robust basis on which to develop
                                   financial inclusion policies.


                                   Sampling Individuals versus Households

                                   Although the ultimate interest is in a gender-stratified sample of individuals, it is an
                                   inefficient use of survey funds to go to 2000 different households to survey 2000
                                   individuals. Such an approach also will preclude the use of some empirical methods
                                   for the analysis once the unit record data are available. While there is potentially
                                   a gain in statistical efficiency (precision) because a sample built up by having one
                                   person selected from each of 2000 different households will have more variation than
                                   a sample of 1000 households, each supplying two respondents, this is not sufficient
                                   advantage to recommend the design of one-individual-per-household, for the following
                                   reasons:

                                      ■■      Surveys on financial topics typically have high rates of refusal, so with a
                                              one-respondent-per-household rule, it may be that any differences that

     example, females in richer households may be more likely to respond and
     males in poorer households more likely to respond, so what appears to be a
     male-female difference in the data is in fact driven by an income difference in
     survey compliance. This lack of ‘balance’ in the gender sub-samples especially
     matters to this survey since there is no plan to collect detailed household-
     level data on incomes or consumption (interviews are expected to be only
     one-hour per respondent) which could otherwise be used as covariates to
     control for these threats to validity posed by differential non-compliance.

■■   Surveys of household wealth and financial management often find
     discrepancies between what males and females in the same household
     report on ostensibly the same matters (see e.g. various studies from the
     Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey). This is an
     important behaviour to observe since it can be informative about the extent
     to which financial information, decisions and risks are pooled within the
     household, and it is impossible to observe this with only one respondent per
     household.

■■   The lack of detailed household-level data on consumption, income or wealth
     makes it possible that statistical analyses of the data are susceptible to
     omitted-variable bias. Such bias occurs when variables not captured by the
     survey are relevant to the behaviour under study and are correlated with
     policy-relevant variables that the survey captures and that analysts use to try
     to explain behaviour. For example, there may be more joint financial decision
     making in richer households, but these are also households where women’s
     education is typically higher, so this difference in financial decision-making
     could wrongly be attributed to an effect of women’s education rather than
     to an effect of unobserved household wealth. One partial solution to this
     problem is use household fixed effects (dummy variables) as follows:

                                yi j = a j + Di + xij + e ij

	    where yi j is the outcome of interest for person i in household j, a j is a
     household-specific fixed effect that captures average differences between
     households, Di is a dummy variable to indicate gender of the respondent,
     xi j are control variables such as education or age that can vary between
     individuals in a household and e ij is a random error. In other words, after
     controlling for observable covariates of individuals and for differences
     between each household (the a j can be considered household-specific
     conditional means), is there a systematic difference in behaviour y between
     men and women? However this estimation framework relies on having more
     than one respondent per household.

                                      ■■    It is only in coastal PNG that rural villages are spatially concentrated (so there
                                            is only a low marginal cost to go from one dwelling to a neighbour in order
                                            to survey an extra individual). In the Highlands, many rural Census Units are
                                            simply clusters of scattered hamlets, so it is expensive in time and energy to
                                            reach a particular household, so once there it makes sense to interview more
                                            than one respondent.

                                   These advantages of obtaining 2000 respondents by (ideally) surveying one man
                                   and one woman per household in 1000 households make this the preferred design
                                   and the selection of Census Units outlined below has proceeded on this basis. But
                                   survey funders and implementers should be aware of two implications of this design:
                                   (a) it requires a minimum of two person teams, so that men can be interviewed by
                                   men and women by women, and (b) some redundancy will be needed in the number
                                   of households surveyed since it will not be possible to always find one adult male
                                   and one adult female per household. The average number of adults (age 18+) per
                                   household ranges from 2.4 in Manus to 3.5 in Southern Highlands and NCD, so most
                                   households should have at least two adults and these are likely to be a man and a
                                   woman. But households with widows and widowers, households where one adult is
                                   away temporarily (e.g. at work camps), and units of polygamous households where
                                   each wife has an independent dwelling and a husband rotates between these, will
                                   all be expected to yield only one adult respondent. Moreover, the gendered nature of
                                   many rural tasks means that often it will not be possible to find a male and a female
                                   from the same household together at the same time since they are conducting
                                   different tasks in different places. The sample design described below allows for a
                                   fieldwork schedule where teams are in a CU for approximately 3–4 days, so there is
                                   time for return visits to those households where one adult was absent on the initial
                                   visit, although interviewers are often unwilling to make these extra efforts. Therefore
                                   the sample is designed for 1100 households, assuming that for approximately
                                   100 households it will not be possible to survey both a man and a woman. These
                                   ‘unbalanced’ households are still useful in the analysis so this sample redundancy
                                   does not imply inefficient use of survey funds.


                                   Target Number of Households per Census Unit

                                   Moving up a sampling level, from the question of how many individuals per household
                                   to survey, the next question is how many households per Census Unit (CU) to survey. A
                                   discussion of the related issues of how to select households in each CU is (that is, the
                                   listing and selection approach) and how to plan for refusals and other non-response
                                   is covered later. It is advantageous to require the teams to survey a fixed number of
                                   households per CU, so that a standardized fieldwork plan can be adhered to, which
                                   reduces interviewer discretion (so that lazy interviewers cannot claim that the CU
                                   was smaller than expected so they reduced their quota of interviews accordingly, in a
                                   design where the target number of households varies with CU size).

In general, clustered survey designs are less efficient, the more highly correlated
within local areas are the behaviours under study. Conversely, where there is a large
idiosyncratic component, even designs where up to 20 households are surveyed in
each enumeration area (EA) can still see the 20th household providing some new
information. In the case of financial literacy or competency, most studies find that
this varies with experience of various financial transactions and with education. Both
of these factors are likely to be highly correlated within CUs since they reflect the
proximity to financial institutions (which is common for everyone in the same CU) and
education is highly related to wealth, which affects residential sorting. It is therefore
best to allocate the sample of 1100 households over more CUs, with fewer households
surveyed per CU. This design is especially recommended because many CUs in PNG
are quite small, averaging just 50 households. In the 1996 household survey, out of
80 selected CUs (outside of the NCD), three (4 percent) were too small to enable the
target of 12 households to be surveyed, and so had to be combined with neighbouring
CUs, with listing and household selection then carried out on the pseudo-CU created
from the joining of the two neighbours. This is a complicated process which it is best
to avoid at the outset.

The recommendation is that outside of the NCD, ten (10) households per CU should
be selected to survey. For the NCD sample (the reason for this being a separate strata
are discussed below) the target should be six households per Census Unit. The reason
for the different targets is that fieldwork fixed costs (e.g., transportation to the CU)
are lower in an urban area like the NCD, so the sampling efficiency advantages of
a smaller cluster size outweigh the budgetary advantages of a larger cluster size.
Moreover, it may be possible to avoid a listing operation in the selected CUs for the
NCD since the NSO mapping of those CUs is relatively recent, allowing selection of
dwellings to be done from paper maps. A supplement (or fall-back) to relying on the
NSO maps of NCD Census Units is to use Google Maps aerial images, which have
sufficiently high resolution for NCD that it allows easy identification of individual
dwellings, even in a densely populated urban village like Hanuabada. Consequently,
the fixed cost of listing a CU should matter less in NCD, so there is a smaller time
and cost disadvantage to offset the statistical efficiency advantages of spreading a
given sample size over more CUs. Finally, it is likely that surveying individual dwellings
is more difficult in the NCD, because all adults are absent during the day, because
night time surveying is infeasible due to security issues, and because of difficulty in
gaining access to guarded residences. Therefore more “reserve” households should be
allowed for in each CU, which dictates having a smaller number of households initially
targeted for selection (allowing more to be kept for reserves).


Stratification and Stage One and Two Selections

Stratification allows us to use prior information to structure a sample so that it
reflects the range of conditions in the population, rather than relying on this occurring

                                                                                                93

                                   by chance (which it would only do in the right proportions if we had the luxury of
                                   drawing repeated samples). Another reason to stratify is to introduce uneven sampling
                                   weights, if it is desirable to over-sample a particular area. Along these lines, at the
                                   outset a decision was made to divide the sample into two main strata: (i) the National
                                   Capital District (NCD), and (ii) all other areas of the country. This was to ensure that
                                   the NCD was included in the sample, and given almost four-times the sample size than
                                   its population would justify, ensuring sufficient sample size in the event of any follow-
                                   up survey. While it would be ideal for a follow-up survey to have national coverage,
                                   the reality is that it is often easier to obtain (donor) funding for new, baseline surveys
                                   than it is for on-going follow-up surveys. Consequently, the logistical and financial
                                   constraints on any future follow-up survey may be such that it is restricted to the NCD,
                                   so ensuring sufficient sample size in that region at baseline is useful. The different
                                   sampling fractions for the NCD and the rest of the country will be controlled for by
                                   using weights (expansion factors) when forming national estimates. An additional
                                   reason for forcing the NCD into the sample is that this area has the most favourable
                                   conditions in the country, in terms of access to financial services and levels of
                                   education that should support informed use of financial services. Hence, if the survey
                                   identifies major shortfalls that occur in these more ideal conditions in the NCD it is
                                   potentially revealing about the scope of the task that financial inclusion interventions
                                   will require in more challenging regions of the country. Finally, the experience in
                                   the NCD provides a natural comparison point which PNG officials (both elected and
                                   appointed) should relate to, given the unfortunate reality that many of them do not
                                   have recent first-hand experience of conditions in more remote districts but they do
                                   have first-hand experience of the NCD.

                                   Stratification also was applied to the non-NCD sample in order to improve the precision
                                   of sample estimates. All provinces were sorted according to the female adult literacy
                                   rate, prior to the first-stage PPeS selection of provinces. The first reason for using female
                                   literacy as the stratifying variable is that gender differences in financial competency, in
                                   the degree of discrimination against women in access to and use of financial services,
                                   and in household decision-making that leads to gendered effects in the use of money,
                                   ultimately rely on variations in female bargaining power, which is plausibly higher,
                                   the more educated are females (relative to males). The second reason is that prior
                                   studies of financial literacy of Pacific Islanders find that greater formal education is the
                                   characteristic that is most predictive of an individual having superior financial literacy.
                                   In PNG, the provinces with highest female literacy rates also tend to have the highest
                                   overall education levels, so stratifying provinces by female literacy rates ensures that the
                                   survey will cover the full range of conditions for these two factors that are likely to be
                                   closely associated with the financial competency behaviours under study.

                                   The available data on female adult literacy rates came from the 2000 Census, since
                                   final estimates from 2011 were not available. This reliance on prior estimates should

not overly matter since the spatial pattern of female literacy likely changes only slowly.
One implication of using data from the 2000 Census is that it was necessary to form
estimates for the two new provinces of Jiwaka and Hela (which did not exist in 2000),
and also to revise estimates for the Southern Highlands and Western Highlands, which
are the two existing provinces that the new provinces have been carved out of. The
new provinces were formed by reallocating three districts from each of the existing
provinces, so district-level literacy rates were aggregated (weighing by the number
of adult females) to form estimates corresponding to the new and revised provinces.
The resulting ranking of provinces is shown in Table 31, with the female literacy
rate ranging from 29.5 percent in Enga to 83.7 percent in Manus (and 88.7 percent
in the NCD, which is in a separate stratum). This variable clearly captures some of
the considerable heterogeneity that occurs between provinces in PNG, which it is
important to have reflected in the sample that is selected.

In order to select from amongst these ranked provinces, four values are required:

	 a)	The total number of households from the 2011 preliminary Census counts
         (1,367,029 excluding the households in the NCD).

	 b)	The target number of provinces, set here as seven (7) to ensure that a range
         of circumstances are covered by the sample while not spreading fieldwork
         too thinly.

	 c)	The ratio of (a) to (b), which gives the sampling interval of 195,290. Essentially
         the province containing every 195,290th household is selected after a random
         start, where this naturally gives higher odds of selection for a province with
         more households (which is the basis of PPeS selection).

	 d)	The random starting value, obtained by multiplying the sampling interval
         by a random number. The random number which was generated in Excel
         was 0.9121, so the random starting value is 0.9121 3 195,290 = 178,124. In
         other words, the province containing the 178,124th household was the first
         selected, and then skipping down another 195,290 households, to find the
         next selected province, which is the one containing the 178,124 + 195,290 =
         373,414th household, and so forth.

The seven selected provinces outside of the NCD contain 38 districts (out of
87 districts in all of PNG) and the second stage sampling involved selecting 19 of these
districts. The first stratifying variable used was the female literacy rate (at district
level), with each district put into one of three groups:

   ■■    Adult literacy rate for females is ≤ 33 percent (n = 12)

   ■■    Adult literacy rate for females ranges from 33.1 percent–66.9 percent (n = 14)

   ■■    Adult literacy rate is ≥ 67 percent (n = 12)


                                                                                                95

National Planning and Monitoring. The rankings of districts according to these three
(closely overlapping) measures are discussed in Gibson et al. (2005), focussing on
                                                                   43
the 20 most disadvantaged districts under each ranking. A group of 13 districts are
ranked worst according to both the predicted poverty rate and either or both of the
other two indexes. These are locations within PNG that are widely agreed upon to
be disadvantaged and six of these districts are from the seven provinces selected
for the survey so it is important that the survey captures conditions in some of these
areas. The next group of 23 less disadvantaged districts have at least one of the three
indexes ranking them amongst the 20 most disadvantaged districts, so these are areas
for which there is reasonable agreement that people living there face considerable
difficulties. Amongst this second group of 23, there are 8 districts that come from the
seven selected provinces and it is important for this level of disadvantage to also be
represented in the final sample. Finally, the remaining 51 districts, which include urban
areas such as Lae, are not typically considered areas of major disadvantage or poverty
in PNG and there are 24 such districts within the seven provinces selected.

The cross-tabulation of the two stratifying variables in Table 32 shows one empty
cell, for the combination of highest poverty and highest female literacy. All other
strata have at least two districts, supporting use of a ‘nearest neighbour’ approach to
selecting a replacement district in exceptional cases where it is impossible to conduct
fieldwork in the original selected district.

   The disadvantage index is a composite of five indicators; each ranging from 1–5, measuring
land potential, agricultural pressure, access to services, income from agriculture, and child
malnutrition. The index thus ranges from 5 (most disadvantaged) to 25 (least disadvantaged), and
it is ranks of the index that are used here.

The 38 districts in the seven selected provinces are listed in Table 33, sorted according
to their stratifying variables, and then according to province code. The number of
households in each district, the cumulative number of households and the order of
selection are also shown.

The selection of 19 districts from amongst the 38 available in the seven provinces
followed the same approach that was used for the first-stage selection. Specifically,
four values were required:

	 a)	The total number of households in all 38 districts from the 2011 preliminary
          Census counts (613,652).

	 b)	The target number of districts (19).

	 c)	The ratio of (a) to (b) gave the sampling interval of 32,297, so the district
          containing every 32,297th household is selected after a random start (so
          more populous districts are more likely to be in the sample under this PPeS
          selection).

	 d)	The random starting value, obtained by multiplying the sampling interval by
          the random number (0.1604 generated in Excel) was 5179, where the district
          containing this household was the first district in the stratified list—Goilala.
          Thereafter, skipping down another 32,297 households, to find the next
          selected district and so forth.

The result of this selection process is summarized in Table 34, in terms of the coverage
of the various strata. The range of conditions existing in the selected seven provinces
are well covered by the selected districts, with every feasible cell (noting there are no
districts in these seven provinces in the high literacy-high poverty cell) having at least
one representative. Thus, even though only 19 districts out of the 87 districts in Papua
New Guinea have been selected into the sample, these cover the varying range of
circumstances that households face.

                                   In terms of the provincial break-down of the selected districts, there are two from
                                   each of Central, Western Highlands, Jiwaka, Madang and East New Britain, three from
                                   Eastern Highlands and six from Morobe. It may appear surprising that one province
                                   supplies six of the selected districts, but this reflects the size and heterogeneity of
                                   this particular province, which has the largest number of districts of any province, and
                                   the spread of these over five different strata. This spread is symptomatic of the intra-
                                   province differences that exist in PNG, which is also exemplified by Central province,
                                   where the two selected districts neighbour each other but come from opposite
                                   ends of the stratified ranks (Goilala is in the highest poverty-lowest literacy class and
                                   Kairuku/Hiri is in the lowest poverty-highest literacy class).

                                   Moreover, it is important to emphasize that the aim of the sampling is not to
                                   produce estimates that are representative for a particular province. Instead the
                                   aim is to represent the range of conditions found throughout PNG so as to build up
                                   representative national estimates. Thus, even with six districts selected from Morobe,
                                   the results are not representative for Morobe since three districts are not selected and
                                   since the six districts chosen were not meant to be representative at Provincial level.
                                   Likewise, even with the same inclusion rate of two-thirds, the results for Jiwaka where
                                   two out of the three districts in that province are in the sample, will not be expected
                                   to be representative of that province. Instead the selected districts are representing
                                   combinations of female literacy and overall disadvantage or poverty that occur in
                                   other areas of Papua New Guinea as well, and that are expected to lead to variation in
                                   (gendered) financial competency.


                                   Stage Three Selections of Census Units

                                   The logistics of survey organization are likely to be simplified if the same number of
                                   Census Units is targeted to be surveyed in each of the selected districts. In this way,
                                   it is possible to organize more standard team sizes and workloads, and it removes

discretion from field staff, who may exploit any discretion in the choice of how many
CUs to survey in each district by shirking. The recommendation is to survey five
Census Units per district, which would provide a workload of approximately 12–15
days per team, under an assumption that teams can interview 3–4 households per
day, and depending on the time needed for listing in each CU and for movement of the
teams between Census Units in the same district.

One possible concern with a fixed quota of CUs per district is the uneven size of
districts, which at the extremes range from 6,366 households in Goilala to 37,851
households in Anglimp/South Waghi (both based on preliminary Census counts). This
concern would matter if districts had been selected with equal probability (say, using
simple random sampling), since Census Units in small districts then have higher odds
of being selected. But in fact, the selection is based on probability proportional to
size, and so the odds of a small district like Goilala being selected are much lower
than are the odds for a large district like Anglimp/South Waghi. Because the sample
weights are the inverse of the selection probabilities, the CUs selected in Goilala
already have a large weight (because they represent a large number of households
in other small districts in PNG). Selecting fewer CUs from Goilala because of its small
size would make the weight for the remaining CUs in that district even larger, causing
statistical and economic inefficiency (extreme weights make the results sensitive to
the value for particular observations, and indicate a poor spatial budget allocation
since money is spent surveying in some CUs that have little impact on the overall
weighted results).

This same logic of probability-proportion-to-size selection also explains why it is
possible to survey the same number of households (10) in Census Units that can be
quite variable in size, ranging from fewer than 20 households to sometimes several
hundred. Since larger Census Units already have a higher probability of selection,
there is no need to survey more households from a larger CU than a smaller CU, and
to do so would be to introduce unequal weights. The advantage of a fixed quota of
households to interview per CU is that it reduces incentives for interviewer shirking
because it removes any discretion over sample selection.

The selected Census Units for the 19 districts are listed in Table 35, along with the
names of the district, of the Local Level Government (LLG) and of the Ward that the
Census Unit is part of. The preliminary count of households in each Census Unit is
also listed, and it is this preliminary count which influences the selection probability.
When updated estimates of the size of each selected CU are available from the listing
done by the interview teams, the final survey weights can be calculated, which take
into account any difference between preliminary and final counts. It is for this reason,
along with ensuring a representative sample of households from each CU rather than
an unrepresentative convenience sample, that a listing operation is required.

Note: Census Units with highlighted counts may require segmenting (for large units) and combining for small units.


The selected Census Units include one small CU, Kariaritsi in Goilala District, for which
the preliminary Census count suggests there will be insufficient households to allow
a quota of ten to be surveyed. It is therefore recommended to create a pseudo-CU by
joining Kariaritsi with its neighbour in the same ward, Kataipa. The merged CU should
enable a quota of ten households to be surveyed. Conversely there are eight CUs
that appear to be so large that listing and surveying may be logistically burdensome
if the entire CU is attempted to be covered. These large CUs are candidates for
being segmented, where a sub-unit of the CU is selected at random (e.g., using a
sequence of coin tosses, if it is one-half, one-quarter or one-eighth of the CU that
is to be selected). The listing and household level selection then occurs only within
the segment of the CU, and the count of households in the segment is inflated by
the inverse of the sampling fraction to estimate the total size of the CU (e.g., if the
segment is one-quarter, then four times the count of households in that segment is
used as the estimate for the size of the overall CU). It is important that the decision
to segment a CU is made in advance and not by the team on the ground, otherwise
listing efforts are likely to be compromised by shirking teams deciding to only partially
list a CU, biasing the sample towards the most easily accessible households.

The survey is likely to face localized disruptions that either prevent interview teams
from reaching a Census Unit, or from fielding the survey once there. A set of 19
replacement CUs has been selected (one per selected district) using a PPeS draw
and these are listed in Table 36. It is important that survey funders and implementers
determine in advance what level of decision-making unit, from team supervisors up
through the overall survey organizer, is allowed to make the decision to abandon
attempts in one CU and use the replacement CU from the same district. If control over
this decision is not determined in advance the sample integrity will be degraded, as
it is likely that teams give up on difficult-to-reach CUs, violating the requirements of
a representative sample.

                                      In the NCD there are fewer logistical barriers to reaching selected CUs, but the
                                      rate of refusal or non-contact of households is likely to be much higher. It is not
                                      clear therefore that replacement CUs are needed for the NCD, so only the target of
                                      25 selected CUs are listed (in Table 37). These have been selected using PPeS, where
                                      the implicit stratification is according to Census Division (Ward) numbering, starting
                                      from Gerehu, proceeding through Waigani, Gordons, Boroko, Town, and out to Bomana.
                                      This is broadly a North to South and then a West to East direction; with the selected
                                      CUs including urban villages, settlements, and employer-based housing schemes.
                                      Several of the selected CUs are quite large and will require segmenting prior to the
                                      selection of households, and this may be aided with the Census maps and also the
                                      aerial images from Google Maps which have a high resolution for NCD.

Stage Four Selection of Households (and Listing)

Listing of all households in the selected CU is required for two purposes: for ensuring
that all parts of the CU are represented amongst the surveyed households, and for
checking on the size of the CU that affected its selection probabilities (with the actual
size from the listing used to reweight compared with the estimated size used for the
initial selection). The team walks around in every part of the CU, accompanied by a


                                                                                              107

                                   guide who is a member of the community. If possible, find a person who worked with
                                   the Census in this community or someone with similar knowledge of the community
                                   and ask them to be your guide. Make sure you go to all parts of the CU, including
                                   outlying hamlets. In hamlets, or in any place far from the centre, always check: “Do
                                   these people belong to (Name) village or Census Unit” In every part of the village,
                                   ask the guide about every house: “Who lives in this house? What is the name of the
                                   household head?” Note that you do not have to visit every household. At best, you
                                   just need to see each house but you do not need to go inside it or talk to anyone
                                   who lives there. Even the rule of seeing each house may be relaxed if there are far
                                   away households for which good information can be provided by the guide. The most
                                   important thing in the listing is to be sure that you list all the households and only the
                                   households belonging to the named village or Census Unit (or subset of the Census
                                   Unit if it is to be segmented). It does not matter in what order you list the households
                                   as long as they are all listed.

                                   If the Census Unit is large, such that it exceeds approximately 200 households, or is
                                   very dispersed (as in parts of the Highlands) it is not practical to attempt to list the
                                   whole Census Unit, so a decision is made in advance to split the Census Unit into
                                   smaller areas (perhaps groupings of clans, or based on a geographical feature). First,
                                   a local informant should communicate the boundaries of the Census Unit and any
                                   natural or administrative sub-units within the larger Census Unit (such as hamlets or
                                   canyons/valleys). The sub-units should be big enough to allow for the selection of a set
                                   of households (about 40 or more), Once the sub-unit is defined, its boundaries should
                                   be clearly described. Then one of the smaller units is randomly selected and the
                                   procedures outlined above are then followed to complete the listing and interviewing
                                   just in that sub-unit.

                                   After the listing is complete, check that all lines on the listing form are numbered
                                   consecutively with no gaps, from start to finish. The number on the last line should
                                   be exactly the number of households listed. If the list is long (say more than
                                   50 households) interviewers may encounter difficulties when looking for their selected
                                   household. One useful way to avoid this is to show approximately the place in the list
                                   where certain landmarks are. This can be done by writing in the margin, CHURCH or
                                   STORE or whatever.

                                   The sampling within the CU uses circular systematic selection, which differs from
                                   the selection procedure described above for provinces, districts and CUs. Let M be
                                   the total number of households listed, and the sampling interval L is calculated as
                                   (M÷10), rounding to the nearest whole number. Let R be a random number with 3-digit
                                   decimals between 0.000 and 0.999 (if the proposal to use tablets for interviewing is
                                   implemented, the random number can be calculated in the field, otherwise the listing
                                   forms may need to have random numbers pre-written on them). Multiply M by R and
                                   round to the nearest whole number, which gives the 1st selection. Note that this could

occur anywhere on the list since the random number lies in the 0–1 interval. Enter SEL
against this line in the selection column of the list. Count down the list, beginning after
the 1st selection, a distance of L lines to get the 2nd selection, then another L to get
the 3rd, etc. When you come to the bottom of the list, jump back to the top as if the
list were circular. Stop after the 10th selection. There is now a systematic sample of
the households in the Census Unit (or segment of the Census Unit).

In order to allow for replacement households in case of refusals, advance down L
lines from the 10th selection, and that household is a Reserve (if this happens to be
an already selected household, go down one further line). Additional reserves can be
found by moving down L lines each time, as needed. It is important that the Listing
Form be kept as a record of the selection, and that records be kept when replacement
households are used. These details also are needed because the count of households
in the CU is important for calculating the final sampling weights.


Weights and Variance Calculations

The overall sampling weight attached to each household is the product of three
intermediate weights: the first stage (province) weight, the second stage (district)
weight, and the third stage (CU) weight adjusted for the selection of a particular
number of households within the selected Census Unit. Consequently, the final survey
weights can only be calculated once the survey fieldwork is complete, since the
achieved sample size may differ from the target sample size in some Census Units
(and this is only known ex post), and also because the estimate of the number of
households in the CU from the survey listing is needed in the calculation of the final
weights. However, the structure of the required calculations for each of the weights
can be outlined in advance, as follows:

   ■■    First stage weight, which represents the inverse of the first-stage selection
         probability assigned to each province. This Province Weight (PW) depends on
         five values, where only three of these were known at the time of selection:
         the number of provinces to be selected (7), the preliminary count of
         households in all provinces excluding NCD, which is denoted M (=1,367,029),
                                                           th
         and the preliminary count of households in the i province, denoted mi.
         The remaining two values become available once the final Census counts
         are released, and are the ratios of the final count of households, M' to
         the preliminary count of households, M in all provinces outside the NCD
         (R = M'/M) and this same ratio of the final count to the preliminary count of
                             th
         households in the i province (ri = mi'/mi).

                                      	     The weight calculation above shows how various terms cancel once the ratios
                                            of final counts to preliminary counts are introduced. The cancelation of terms
                                            highlights the fact that there is no presumption that the measures of size used
                                            in the initial selection, M and mi are fully accurate. Hence, ongoing debates in
                                            PNG about the reliability or timeliness of the 2010 Census are not germane
                                            to the sample integrity for the Financial Capability Survey. If the initial counts
                                            are accurate, the sampling (random) error is likely to be smaller, which is an
                                            advantage, but irrespective of whether they are accurate or not, there will be
                                            no bias, provided the above weights are used. Specifically, in the set of fractions
                                            after the second equals sign, the value mi in the numerator of the final term
                                            and the value M in the denominator of the second term are introduced in order
                                            to cancel the varying probabilities which were initially used in selecting the
                                            provinces. This cancelling will only occur if we use identically the same values
                                            for M and mi in the weighting formula as those used in selecting the sample.
                                            That the preliminary counts used at that stage may have been inaccurate does
                                            not matter because they are going to be updated by introducing the values M'
                                            and mi', coming from the finally released counts.

         remaining two values needed for calculating the selection probability for each
         Census Unit in each district become available once the final Census counts
         are released and once the survey fieldwork is complete. These are the ratios
         of the final count of households, Di' to the preliminary count of households, Di
         in each selected district (Qi = Di'/Di) and this same ratio of the final estimate
         of the number of households in the Census Unit (from the listing done for

         Unit that the selection was based on (qj = cj'/cj). The remaining component
         of this third stage weight is the inverse of the selection probabilities for each
         household within Census Unit j, given by the ratio of the final estimate of
         the number of households in the Census Unit (from the listing done for the
         survey), which is denoted by cj' to the actual number of households with
         completed surveys, h (which is targeted to be 10).

The final weight will be the product of the CWij , the DWi , and the PWi , and is
interpreted as the number of households nationally that are represented by each
household that is surveyed.

The use of the correct weights will ensure that estimates of sample means,
proportions and totals are nationally representative. However, there also is interest in
measures of uncertainty (standard errors and variances) due to the point estimates
coming from a sample rather than from a complete enumeration of all households in
PNG. These measures of sampling error have to allow for the complex nature of the
sample, in terms of the weights, the stratification, and most especially the clustering
resulting from the multi-stage selection process. In general, clustered samples have
less variability in them than simple random samples (SRS) of the same size, since
observations from the same cluster are more alike than observations drawn at
random. With less variability, the sampling errors are wider than they would be for
a simple random sample of the same size and this is typically shown in terms of a
“design effect” (the ratio of the actual variance to what the variance would be with a
sample of the same size but drawn using SRS).

The design effect for multi-stage clustered samples, like the one drawn here, is
typically larger than if the sample of selected Census Units had been drawn in a single
stage. Of course, offsetting the higher sampling errors for a multi-stage clustered
design compared with, say, a two-stage design are the potentially smaller non-
sampling errors that result from being able to better control survey fieldwork that
is operating only in a limited number of provinces and districts rather than being
thinly spread over the whole country. Moreover, the sampling design effects can be
calculated but the effects of non-sampling errors remain unknown and introduce
inaccuracies and non-comparable survey conduct in ways that are impossible to know.

                                   What is important at the analysis stage when calculating the sampling errors is to
                                   use software that can correctly account for the particular sampling design used.
                                   One option, which may be familiar to some users of the final survey data, would be
                                   SPSS. However, within the Complex Samples module of SPSS 17, the Sampling and
                                   Analysis Preparation wizards allows a maximum of only three stages in a sample
                                   design whereas four stages are used here. A better option is probably Strata, which is
                                   more flexible and allows more stages. The specific information that is needed for the
                                   command that would be used to declare the nature of the survey data is as follows:

Appendix 3b: Sampling Weights for the PNG Financial
Capability Survey
John Gibson. 21 April 2015


Background

The original sample selection was based on a stratified four-stage random sample
design, with preliminary counts from the 2011 Census of Population providing the
sampling frame. Due to the limited survey budget and the logistical difficulties of
surveying in PNG, the first stage selection drew a stratified sample of just seven
provinces to ensure that fieldwork was not spread too thinly over the whole country.
These provinces included three from the Highlands (Western Highlands, Jiwaka,
Eastern Highlands), two from Momase (Madang and Morobe), and one each from the
New Guinea Islands (East New Britain) and Papuan (Central) regions. These seven
provinces had been selected using female literacy and predicted poverty as the
stratifying variables, since it was expected that these variables are likely to be closely
related to financial access and financial capability (especially given the focus of the
survey on gender differences) so stratifying by these variables would ensure that the
sample covered the range of conditions found in PNG. In addition, the original sample
had the National Capital District (NCD) included as a separate survey strata.

At the second stage, a stratified sample of 19 districts was chosen from the seven
provinces, with selection probabilities proportional to estimated size (PPeS, where
‘size’ is the number of households in each district). Six of those 19 districts were from
Morobe province, where this high number from one province occurred by chance but
also reflects two features of Morobe: it has a wide range of conditions, which means
that it is represented in most of the cells of the stratification table, since it has some
districts that are amongst the most disadvantaged in PNG while other districts are
some of the most well off, in terms of having high rates of literacy and low rates of
poverty. Secondly, it has the largest population of any province and so probability
proportional to size selection will tend to select areas from this province. The
neighbouring province of Madang also had two districts selected.

As it turned out, the survey was only able to be fielded in Morobe and Madang.
The calculated sample weights therefore need to be revised to reflect this changed
scope so that the estimates from the survey may be in some sense representative of
conditions in Morobe and Madang. The purpose of this note is to explain the approach
taken to re-weighting. It should be read in conjunction with the original sampling
report, which also provided details on the appropriate variance estimators to use with
this complex sample design.

It should be noted that the change in the scope and sample size of the survey should
not affect the recommendations made in the original report for the most appropriate

                                   variance estimator to use when calculating standard errors or testing hypotheses. Nor
                                   does the change in focus reduce the representativeness of the results for each of the
                                   selected districts. However, it is the case that some reweighting at Census Unit level
                                   is also needed (and is discussed below) because the achieved sample sizes within the
                                                                                                                  44
                                   selected districts were not always the same as the target sample size. In some cases
                                   an entire Census Unit was inaccessible and a replacement CU was surveyed, based
                                   on a pre-set list of one CU per selected district which had been selected using a PPeS
                                   draw.


                                   Reweighting of Districts

                                   The eight districts from the original selection that were surveyed represent
                                   themselves and a certain number of other districts, to add up to the total number
                                   of districts in the sample frame. If these districts had been chosen using a random
                                   selection (with probability proportional to size), where the sample frame was just
                                   the 15 districts in Morobe and Madang (rather than a sample frame of all districts in
                                   the originally selected seven provinces) then the district-level weight (DWi) would be
                                   straightforward to calculate from three values:

                                   	 a)	The total number of households in Morobe and Madang from the 2011
                                             Census counts, which is denoted M (this number equals 227,409)

                                                                                   th
                                   	 b)	The number of households in the i selected district, denoted mi (this count
                                             ranges from 11,120 households to 23,661 households)

                                   	 c)	The target number of districts (n=8)

                                                                             DWi = 1 M                                            (1)
                                                                                   8 mi
                                   	                                                       	

                                   This weight ranges from a low of 1.20 for a large district like Lae to 2.56 for a small
                                   district like Finschafen. The intuition for this variation is that Lae has a high probability
                                   of being selected, given its large size, while Finschafen has a much lower probability.
                                   Thus, Finschafen represents more districts, since it is an example of the small,
                                   unlikely-to-be-selected types of districts while Lae does not represent as many other
                                   districts since large districts are already more likely to be selected. If the resulting
                                   weights are applied, then in the hypothetical situation where all households in each

                                      The third and fourth stage selection were that within each district, five Census Units (CUs)
                                   were selected with probability proportional to estimated size (PPeS) and within each CU a
                                   total of ten households were to be selected, using circular systematic sampling. In addition, a
                                   ‘replacement’ CU per district was selected, again using PPeS, in cases where one of the originally
                                   selected CUs was inaccessible.

selected district were surveyed, the weighted number of households would equal the
                                                                           45
total of 227,409 in the 15 districts in Morobe and Madang.

The problem with this calculation is that these eight districts were not selected from
a sample frame made up of just Morobe and Madang Districts and instead were
selected from a much larger frame that was subject to implicit stratification. Therefore
the districts that were selected from Morobe and Madang were designed to represent
conditions in all of PNG (when combined with the districts in the provinces that
were not surveyed) and are not necessarily equally as representative of conditions in
Morobe and Madang.

One approach would be to treat the implicit stratification (which affected the order
in which districts were ranked prior to their initial selection) as if it had been explicit
stratification. The weighting calculation above would then be carried out separately
within each strata so that selected districts were weighted-up so that the sample
would represent all households within that strata. Thus if the selection based on
national-level considerations caused ‘too few’ or ‘too many’ districts to be selected
from with a particular strata, from the point of view of best representing Morobe
and Madang, this reweighting could take care of any shortage or surplus of districts
in the sample. The problem however is that not all cells in the stratification table are
represented amongst the sample of selected districts, as shown in Table 38 below.

The cross-tabulation of the two stratifying variables shows two empty cells, in the
sense that Morobe and Madang have no districts with the combination of being

                                   lowest poverty group and the lowest female literacy group. Of the other seven cells
                                   in the table, only five have districts that were part of the sample, with the cells for the
                                   highest poverty group and lowest female literacy group and for the middle poverty
                                   and middle literacy group not being represented in the sample. In other words, the
                                   approach of up-weighting the selected districts to represent strata totals would not
                                   provide any way for the survey results to represent the conditions that are likely to
                                   exist in Middle Ramu (a very disadvantaged district) and Kabwum (which is middling,
                                   in terms of literacy and poverty). In contrast, the selected districts are drawn heavily
                                   from the most advantaged cell in the table, with high female literacy and low poverty,
                                   and so are likely to represent better financial capability and access than occurs for
                                                                       46
                                   Morobe and Madang as a whole. Thus the approach of treating the implicit strata
                                   as explicit strata and up-weighting the selected districts to get to strata-level total
                                   numbers of households will not work.

                                   Instead, an adaptation of a non-parametric approach for reweighting an entire
                                   distribution, which was developed by DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) and is based
                                   on creating a counterfactual density, is used. This approach has been previously used
                                   in the survey context by Cameron et al. (2010) to re-weight the sample of a survey that
                                   was fielded in just two provinces in Cambodia so that it matched the distribution of
                                   a larger, nationwide, survey. The method relies on a probability model (logit or probit)
                                   being applied to a dataset where the small sample and the large sample are pooled,
                                   and the dependent variable is an indicator for whether each observation comes from
                                   the larger sample or the smaller sample. Intuitively, the observations from the smaller
                                   sample whose characteristics make them more likely to have come from the larger
                                   sample are given a higher weight, while those from the smaller sample that have
                                   characteristics that make them less like the observations in the larger sample are
                                   given a lower weight. When applied in the current context, this method provides a
                                   way to adjust the weights for the selected districts so that they represent all parts of
                                   Morobe and Madang, including the two cells in Table 38 that have districts but were
                                   not covered by the survey.

                                   A probit model was used, with the predictor variables being the female literacy rate
                                   and dummy variables for whether each district was in the high poverty or medium
                                   poverty categories. The observations are districts, which are weighted by their number
                                   of households so as to match the PPeS approach to selection that was used in the

Notes: Predicted probability is from a probit model for the selected districts to be part of a larger
sample that includes all districts in Morobe and Madang, and is rescaled to have a size-weighted
average of 1. The PPeS weight is if selection was from an un-stratified probability proportional to
estimated size selection using a frame made up of all districts in Morobe and Madang, and is rescaled
using the values the rescaled probabilities.


population) that included all 15 districts in Morobe and Madang is around 0.6 (noting
that the eight selected districts contain 134,211 households while all 15 districts
contain 227,405 households, so the mean probability is just under 0.6). However, for
Menyamya, Finschafen, and especially Rai Coast, the predicted probabilities are higher
and reflect the fact that the literacy and poverty conditions found in those districts are
under-represented in the sample compared with their prevalence amongst all Morobe
and Madang Districts. In other words, Menyamya, Finschafen, and Rai Coast are more
like the two districts (Middle Ramu and Kabwum) in the two cells of the stratification
table that were not covered by the selected sample, so that more weight needs to be
put on them so that they also represent those omitted cells.

The predicted probabilities are rescaled, by normalizing by the (number of household)
weighted mean predicted probability (0.619) and this rescaling factor is then applied to
the PPeS weight that is generated from using equation (1). The resulting weights in the
last column of Table 39 are the appropriate ones to apply to each selected district to
represent the range of conditions and the total number of households in all districts of
Morobe and Madang.


Reweighting of Census Units

The originally calculated weights for each Census Unit (CU) were based on a selection
of five Census Units per district to be surveyed, with ten households selected from
each CU. The CUs were selected using PPeS, based on the counts of households in the
2011 Census (and the ‘reserve’ CU for each district was also selected using PPeS). In


                                                                                                          117

                                   principle, these weights could be updated with more recent estimates of the size of
                                   each CU (e.g. from the listing operation prior to the selection of the ten households)
                                   but these details were not provided in the survey dataset. Therefore, the only variation
                                   in the weights from what was originally calculated is for instances where more or
                                   fewer CUs than targeted were surveyed, and instances where more or less than the
                                   target of ten households per CU were surveyed.

                                   The assumption made by the reweighting is that variation from the target number of
                                   households is at random, so that the actually surveyed households from the same
                                   CU are up-weighted or down-weighted to compensate for the over- or under-target
                                                                      47
                                   number of interviews achieved. The same assumption is also made between CUs
                                   within the same district—if fewer than five Census Units were surveyed they are up-
                                   weighted to compensate for the ones that were meant to be surveyed but were not.
                                   The assumption of missing at random is less defensible for CUs than for households
                                   within Census Units, since factors such as geographic inaccessibility and religious
                                   belief are sometimes the reason for why a CU is not surveyed. But it is difficult to
                                   model these factors so as to find surveyed CUs that are more like the unsurveyed
                                   ones, so that these more alike ones can be up-weighted. So the less information-
                                   demanding approach of missing at random is used here.


                                   Final Weights

                                   The overall sampling weight attached to each household is the product of two
                                   intermediate weights: the first stage (district) weight, which is provided in Table 39
                                   above, and the second stage (CU) weight that has been adjusted for the number of
                                   surveyed households within the selected Census Unit and of CUs within the district.
                                   The CU weight and the household weight are listed in Table 40 below. The household
                                   weights range from 499 to 991 and it should be noted that applying these weights
                                   to the final sample gives a weighted total of households that matches the Census
                                   count of households for Morobe and Madang. If the CU weight is used for the sample
                                   of households within a district, it yields weighted estimates representative for that
                                   district (albeit with a small sample size of typically 50 households), given the nature of
                                   the random PPeS selection of CUs within districts and circular systematic sampling of
                                   households within CUs.

                                   For households that provided two sample members, the same household weight
                                   should be used for each member. Thus, the data for households with a male
                                   respondent and female respondent have more impact on calculated summary


                                   47
                                      Note however that the same principle is not applied to weighting individual interviews because
                                   there is no expectation that all households have one adult male and one adult female who would
                                   each be eligible to complete the survey. Thus any imbalance in the number of male and female
                                   interviews is assumed to reflect a gender imbalance present in the population of these two
                                   provinces.

                                   and (initial) local logistics. A MOA was signed between BPNG and NSO. During the
                                   period September–December 2013 the governance committees were established
                                   and the implementing agency (INA) was selected and the survey instrument and
                                   translation was reviewed. The project was launched formally.

                                   During the period November 2013–February 2014 logistics were finalised and
                                   communication commenced with provincial and district authorities, and provincial
                                   NSO offices. Community briefings were held for the initial provinces. Madang and
                                   Morobe, were selected to be the first two provinces to be surveyed, with the training
                                   for enumerators to be undertaken in Lae, the provincial capital of Morobe. Lae is Papua
                                   New Guinea’s second city, and both its industrial capital and the country’s largest port
                                   (and the largest port in the South Pacific region, outside Australia and New Zealand).

                                   Lae was selected for the training because it is the most central and accessible city for
                                   much of the country, with extensive road access to Madang and the Highlands provinces,
                                   as well as across much of the large province of Morobe. The initial pilot survey work
                                   was undertaken during the training period in Morobe province, and, with the selected
                                   enumerators largely from those two provinces, it was logical to proceed with surveying
                                   these two provinces first. Moreover, the two provinces are in some ways a microcosm
                                   of many of the diverse geographical and social characteristics of the whole of Papua
                                   New Guinea. PNG is geographically, economically and ethnically extremely diverse, from
                                   its communities in remote valleys in the Highlands provinces, to coastal and lowland
                                   communities on some of the country’s islands, coasts and accessible and inaccessible
                                   major valleys. It is impossible for any province, or small selection of provinces and
                                   districts to represent the entire country’s range of physical and human characteristics,
                                   nevertheless, Morobe and Madang do reflect many aspects of that diversity.

Data collection was undertaken during the period February–November 2014. An initial
round of data collection was undertaken February–May 2014. This was followed by a
review by the Steering Committee. The decision was taken to contract the scope of
the initial round of data collection to Morobe and Madang. Data collection resumed
July 2014. Two teams on enumerators undertook interviews, initially in Madang and
subsequently in Morobe.

Tablet based data collection was used for the financial capability survey. Data was held
on the tablet and uploaded periodically. This modality proved successful and enabled
data to be collected in remote locations, with data upload when proximate to a cell-
tower.

Enrolment was paper based, as was the location survey. Following the completion
of field work data entry was undertaken in Port Moresby by INA. Data entry was
completed and checked January 2015. Data entry was not required for the financial
capability survey.

Appendix 6: Literature Review of Financial
Capability Measurement
A number of studies have investigated the relationship between financial knowledge
and financial behaviour. Using data from the United States, Lusardi and Tufano (2009)
find that individuals who have low measured levels of financial knowledge tend to pay
minimum balances on credit cards, incur late fees on cards, and use informal sources
of credit. Stango and Zinman (2009) show that people who make mistakes in interest
and future value calculations tend to borrow more and save less. Lusardi and Mitchell
(2009) illustrate that people with low levels of financial knowledge think less about
retirement and that most of them have not planned for retirement at all. A survey
of Russian households shows that financial knowledge is significantly and positively
related to retirement planning involving private pension funds and schemes (Klapper &
Panos, 2011). And in Mexico, Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton (2008) conducted a survey
that reveals that less knowledgeable individuals tend to choose mutual pension funds
with higher fees.

These studies tend to measure financial literacy based on questions that test
knowledge of the time value of money (inflation), interest rates, compounding, and risk
diversification, although the specific measures used vary from study to study (see also
Xu and Zia (2012) for a discussion of different measures of financial knowledge). Most
studies do not aim to measure financial capability in addition to financial knowledge,



                                                                                                       125

                                   and thus there is little existing evidence about the relationship between financial
                                   capability and financial behaviour.

                                   One caveat with the studies mentioned above is that these results are not
                                   necessarily causal. They show a correlation between proxies for financial knowledge
                                   and outcomes of interest, but these correlations may simply reflect unobserved
                                   characteristics of individuals such as their numeracy, ability, parental background, or
                                   other such features. Although some studies try to measure these characteristics and
                                   try to account for them in the analysis, some of these features may not be measurable
                                   and can thus potentially bias the results.

                                   A growing literature tries to address this issue by relying on quasi-experimental or
                                   experimental variation in the provision of financial education programs to measure
                                   the impact of financial knowledge on financial behaviour. The context of these studies
                                   varies widely—for example, in terms of the economic environment and the type of
                                   individuals targeted through the financial education programs.

                                   Compulsory financial education classes taught in high schools have been the subject
                                   of a number of studies. Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki (2001) use exogenous variation
                                   in high school financial education mandates across U.S. states to show that students
                                   exposed to financial education classes save more as adults. However, Cole and Shastry
                                   (2008) cast doubt on these findings, showing that they are not robust to controlling
                                   for state-fixed effects and examining effects over time. Shorter-term evidence comes
                                   from Bruhn et al. (2013) who conducted a randomized experiment providing financial
                                   education in Brazilian public high schools. They find positive effects on financial
                                   knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, and an increase in savings rates. These impacts
                                   are small in absolute magnitude: a 3 percentage point increase in knowledge, and
                                   a 1 percentage point increase in savings. In Germany, Lührmann, Serra-Garcia, and
                                   Winter (2012) find teenagers given financial literacy training show increased interest in
                                   and knowledge of financial matters, and save more in a hypothetical task, but they do
                                   not measure actual savings.

                                   Other studies have focused on providing financial education to working adults,
                                   recognizing the differences in households’ financial needs and exposure across
                                   developed and developing countries. The literature in developed countries tends to
                                   study the impact of financial education on planning for retirement or investment
                                   portfolio choices. Duflo and Saez (2011) show that participation in seminars discussing
                                   retirement savings leads to an increase in retirement plan participation.

                                   In the developing country context, impact evaluations of financial literacy training
                                   have studied the unbanked, insurance take-up, and migrants. One of the first papers
                                   to examine the impact of financial education in a developing country was by Cole,
                                   Sampson, and Zia (2011). The authors implemented a field experiment in Indonesia
                                   where they offered randomly selected unbanked households a financial education

                                                                                            Appendices



course geared toward opening a bank savings account. They find that the financial
education course had no effect on the likelihood of opening a bank savings account
in the full sample, but it had modest effects for uneducated and financially illiterate
households. Cai (2011) used a randomized experiment to show that farmers in rural
China are more likely to take up crop insurance and become less price sensitive after
attending financial education sessions.

Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia (2012); Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012); and Seshan and
Yang (2012) analyse how providing information and financial education affects
the behaviour of migrants and their households. Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia (2012)
work with migrants in New Zealand and Australia, and find that financial education
increases knowledge about remittance transaction costs but does not lead to changes
in the amount of remittances sent or use of the cheapest remittance method. Using
a sample of Indonesian migrants, Doi, McKenzie, and Zia (2012) find that impacts on
financial knowledge, behaviour, and savings are largest when both the migrants and
their families receive financial education. The results show that financial education can
have large effects when provided at a teachable moment, but that this impact varies
according to who is receiving the training. Seshan and Yang (2012) find that Indian
migrants in Qatar increase savings after financial education training, but only if they
had low financial knowledge to begin with.

Overall, the literature thus finds a positive relationship between financial knowledge
and use of formal financial products. Impact evaluations of financial education courses
suggest that this relationship is, at least in part, causal. However, these evaluations
also highlight that financial education courses often only lead to behaviour change for
certain groups of individuals—such as those who had low knowledge to begin with—
but not for others. In addition, the measured impacts are often small, and participation
rates in financial education courses tend to be low. The small effects and low
participation rates suggest that classroom-style workshops may not be the best way
of conveying financial education to adults, who may not have the time or motivation
to attend such workshops. The literature is now moving toward exploring whether
innovative channels for providing financial education can affect behaviour. Ongoing
studies in India, Peru, South Africa, and the United States (among others) are testing
whether the provision of information via videos, radio, mass media, or video games is
effective in improving individuals’ financial decisions (see e.g., Berg and Zia (2013)).

While literature has mostly focused on financial knowledge so far, it has also touched
on concepts related to specific financial capability. Some of the financial education
courses studied through impact evaluations try to teach techniques to improve
budgeting and monitoring of expenses. For example, Bruhn et al. (2013) find that
a comprehensive financial education program in Brazilian high schools leads to an
increase in the percentage of students and parents who make a list of expenses. The
program also increased saving rates. Other studies have examined the relationship

                                   between time preferences and saving behaviour. Brown, Chua, and Camerer (2009)
                                   conducted a behavioural laboratory experiment and find that individuals with present-
                                   biased preferences have a tendency to overspend. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006)
                                   show that commitment savings accounts can help increase savings for individuals
                                   with present-biased preferences. However, more research is needed to investigate
                                   the relationship between different components of financial capability and the use of
                                   different financial products.

                                   The financial capability construct used for this study was developed by Kempson
                                   and colleagues at the Personal Finance Research Centre at the University of Bristol.
                                   Financial capability has become the dominant construct used to examine financial
                                   inclusion, financial knowledge and skill, behaviours and attitudes globally. The
                                   construct was initially developed within the context of the UK and was published in
                                   the landmark FSA UK Financial Capability Study (Atkinson, McKay, Collard, & Kempson,
                                   2007; Atkinson, McKay, Kempson, & Collard, 2006). The FSA study builds on earlier
                                   studies by the Personal Finance Research Centre examining financial exclusion. (Refer
                                   for example: Kempson & Whyley (1999); Kempson, Whyley, Caskey & Collard (2000);
                                   Kempson, Atkinson & Pilley (2004); and Collard & Kempson (2005).)

                                   The instrument was modified and tested at twelve low and middle-income countries
                                   in 2010–2013 to incorporate unique characteristics and challenges in these countries.
                                   The evaluation of these pilots (World Bank, 2013b, 2013d) shows some common
                                   features among the low-income countries in measuring the financial capability
                                   and designing financial capability policies and interventions, namely access,
                                   poverty, location, informality, education and risks. The evaluation finds that these
                                   characteristics are bound to influence the priorities of policy makers with objectives
                                   of financial literacy programs and their target groups; the way individuals behave
                                   “financially” and how they react to interventions to change their behaviour and how
                                   financial capability can be measured.

Financial Inclusion and Financial Capability
in Morobe and Madang Provinces, Papua New Guinea
                 — An initial report of the Papua New Guinea National Financial Capability Survey




“For many Papua New Guineans, the use of nancial services is rather new. This report will
provide a detailed picture of how our population manages their funds and accesses the nancial
services so we can develop policies, nancial products and services to enhance nancial inclusion
and improve nancial capability in PNG.” Mr. Loi M. Bakani, CMG, Governor at the Bank of
Papua New Guinea


“Understanding the way banks and nancial products work is important for managing money
well and saving for the future. The fact that most bank forms in PNG are only written in English, is
an unnecessary barrier to saving and managing money. With this in mind, I’m particularly glad to
see an English-Tok Pisin glossary of nancial terms come out of this project. I have no doubt this
will play an important role in improving nancial literacy in PNG.” Mr. Paul Barker, Managing
Director, Institute of National Affairs
