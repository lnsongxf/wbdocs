Preface
Financial capability, as defined by the World Bank Group (WBG) and in this report, is the capacity to
act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic and environmental conditions. It
encompasses knowledge (literacy), attitudes, skills and behavior of consumers with respect to understanding,
selecting, and using financial services that fit their needs (World Bank 2013d).
Financial capability has become a policy priority for policy makers seeking to promote beneficial
financial inclusion and to ensure financial stability and functioning financial markets. Today people
are required to take increasing responsibility for managing a variety of risks over the life cycle. People who
make sound financial decisions and who effectively interact with financial services providers are more likely
to achieve their financial goals, hedge against financial and economic risks, improve their household’s
welfare, and support economic growth. Boosting financial capability has therefore emerged as a policy
objective that complements governments’ financial inclusion and consumer protection agendas. To this end,
policy makers are increasingly using surveys as diagnostic tools to identify financial capability areas that need
improvement and vulnerable segments of the population which could be targeted with specific interventions.
The Consumer protection and financial capability agenda is increasingly important for Azerbaijan in
the light of the latest market developments and the need to enhance financial stability and restore
public trust. Consumer protection is becoming an important element of financial sector stabilization and
development agenda in Azerbaijan. Reduction of oil prices and weaker macroeconomic fundamentals at the
backdrop of negative external shocks have led to devaluation of the national currency and erosion of public
trust in financial sector. Restoring financial stability, renewing public and investor confidence and mobilizing
higher savings to finance growth are the top priorities of Azerbaijan policy makers. The authorities increasingly
discuss the issues of consumer and depositor protection, responsible lending and finance access. The
expansion of financial regulatory mandates in the area of consumer protection and enforcement has been
long discussed by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) and the State Insurance Supervision Service
                                   2
(SISS) of the Ministry of Finance and will likely continue under the auspices of the newly created Financial
Market Supervisory Chamber. The authorities have already implemented selected initiatives to enhance
consumer protection and complaints handling in recent years. For instance, CBAR has adopted and published
Methodological Guidelines for Responsible Lending in Banks and Non-Bank Credit Institutions in consultation
with the WBG and prepared draft guidelines on information disclosure. As far as financial capability is
concerned, CBAR and other stakeholders carried out a number of financial capability initiatives and a National
Financial Literacy Strategy (NFLS) has been developed and approved by CBAR in early 2016.
To support the authorities in Azerbaijan in their efforts to advance financial capability, the WBG has
implemented a nationally representative financial capability survey of the adult population in
Azerbaijan. This survey constitutes a key diagnostic tool that will inform the development of a detailed
implementation action plan for the NFLS. Moreover, it will help the authorities to set quantifiable and concrete
targets, and assess the effectiveness of future financial capability enhancing programs.
The key findings and recommendations presented in this report cover three main areas: 1. Financial
Inclusion, 2. Financial Capability, and 3. Financial Consumer Protection. Chapter 1 explores the financial
inclusion landscape in Azerbaijan. Chapter 2 gives an overview of levels of financial capability in Azerbaijan,
in particular about their financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. The last chapter investigates if the
products are effectively meeting their needs of financially included individuals .

  On February 3, 2016 the President of Azerbaijan created a new consolidated regulatory and supervisory agency for financial services
(Financial Market Supervisory Chamber), which is taking over regulation and supervision of insurance and credit institutions.

Executive Summary

Financial Inclusion
 Around 36 percent of the surveyed adults in Azerbaijan report owning an account at a formal
 financial institution (a bank, an MFI or an e-money agent), a commonly used metric for
 international comparison. Compared to other upper-middle income economies, Azerbaijan is behind
 the average level in terms of financial inclusion, commercial bank branches and domestic credit
 provided by the financial sector. Global Findex and Financial Capability surveys show that Azerbaijan
 financial inclusion level rose from about 15 percent in 2011 to 29 percent in 2014 and 36 percent in
 2015. When investments, private pensions, and insurance products are included as formal financial
 products, the Survey found that 47.2 percent of Azerbaijani adults use some formal financial product.
 Across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, income level was found to
 have the most significant impact on financial inclusion, followed by whether or not adults are
 in the labour force and size of household. There is a strong correlation between income level and
 financial inclusion. In fact, the gap in financial inclusion between the richest and the poorest quartiles
 is 22.9 percent, corresponding to nearly half of that of the richest quartile. Adults who are out of the
 labour force were found to be 6 percent less financially included than the average employed. Size of
 household is correlated to financial inclusion, however, there is only 3.1 percent average difference
 between smallest and largest size.
 There is only a small difference in financial inclusion between genders overall but an in-depth
 analysis suggests that younger women as compared to younger men have lower financial
 inclusion levels at the backdrop of their lower economic participation. When the sample is broken
 down by age groups, we note, overall, that there is marked difference of inclusion in favour of younger
 male respondents in Azerbaijan (between 18 and 20 years old financial inclusion is 5.2 percent higher
 for men). Inclusion tends to become more or less gender neutral from age 21 to 55, and then it basically
 reverses in favour of female Azerbaijanis (56 and more financial inclusion is 5.7 percent higher for
 women). This pattern clearly suggests a degradation of the younger generation of women compared to
 their elders.
 Banks accounts are the most commonly used financial product, about one third of the
 population reports having this product however almost everybody whether men or women,
 urban or rural, rich or poor, know about services offered by banks. The most notable difference is
 that there are about 17 percent more rich people having bank accounts than the poor (44 percent
 versus 27 percent). In general, 34 percent of the population currently has a formal bank account, 84
 percent claim having used banks in the past and 98 percent know about services offered by banks. At
 the regional level, usage of bank accounts does vary moderately between regions; the spread between
 highest and lowest usage of bank account is 9 percent. There is a positive connection between the
 regional level of wealth as measured by income per capita and holding of bank accounts. However,
 there is a strong negative correlation between historical and current holding of bank accounts. In fact,
 regions with high usage of bank services in the past tend to have the lowest holding of bank accounts
 at present and vice versa. This may suggest that many users of bank services in the past were
 dissatisfied and decided to revert to other mechanisms.
 About one person out of 10 uses money transfer operators (MTOs), predominantly from poor
 and large households in urban areas especially Baku. In general, 12 percent of the population
 currently have money transfer products and more than one third have used such products in the past.
 Furthermore, 3 out of 4 persons know about services offered by money transfer companies. Such
 services were found to be utilized by 3 percent more people in urban areas (especially Baku), by 3
 percent more people from poor households and by 2 percent more people living in the largest


                                                      4
    households. Such facts underpin the notion that poor people receive more financial support from family
    and friends by way of remittances.
    Although almost everybody knows about micro-finance institutions (MFIs) and other non-bank
    credit institutions (NBCI) and 23 percent have used their services in the past, only 6 percent
    have a credit with such institutions – mainly rural rich people, suggesting there is a need for
    sector reform and development. 97 percent of the population knows about MFIs or other NBCIs,
    there are 2 percent more users in rural areas and 9 percent more rich people with a credit at MFIs or
    NBCIs. Holding of an MFI / non-bank credit is strongly correlated to people’s income level as well as
    holding of bank account.
    Approximately one half of the population has used an insurance product in the past but less
    than one out of ten persons and in particular only 3 percent of rural people currently has an
    insurance policy, suggesting a strong need for improvement. Furthermore, 30 percent of the
    population has no idea about services offered by insurance companies. Usage of insurance products
    tends to increase with household size; however, there is a notable difference between urban and rural
    areas. In fact, there are four times more urban than rural people who currently have an insurance policy.
    This is rather astonishing, especially for agriculture in rural areas where there are few buyers of harvest
    insurance allowing to smooth fluctuations in household income due to seasonality.
    Most of the approximately 4 million financially excluded adults do not have enough money to
    use (35 percent) or think it is too expensive (19 percent) to hold such an account. Another
    significant group of people think that they do not need a formal account (39 percent). While these
    answers could suggest voluntary exclusion from the formal financial sector, it does not necessarily
    imply that these adults are not bankable. Instead, it may reflect a cost-benefit analysis on the part of
    these adults and demonstrates that many adults perceive banking services to be of little value, not in
    absolute terms, but for their current income level and the quality of banking products. This could be
    because of the nontrivial costs associated with owning a formal account, from explicit costs like
    minimum balance requirements and withdrawal charges to implicit costs such as transportation.


Recommendations4
With 54 percent of the unbanked Azerbaijanis declaring not having enough or finding it too expensive
to hold a formal account, policies should be considered that encourage provision of basic transaction
accounts at little or no cost, including national cooperation with the post operator. Such basic
transaction accounts should offer functionalities that, at a minimum, make it possible to electronically send
and receive money at little or no costs, and to store value safely. A recent survey which has been carried out
by the Payment aspects of financial inclusion (PAFI) task force among its members on basic accounts
indicated that almost all countries providing information stated that a form of basic account was offered in
their jurisdiction. The survey also found that although a number of countries have already introduced or are
considering introducing legislation giving citizens the right to a basic bank account, such initiative is at an
early stage. In the majority of countries the provision of basic accounts is reported to be a market initiative. In
most of the cases basic accounts were being offered via banks. In some cases, post offices were also involved
in providing such basic accounts, suggesting that in the context of Azerbaijan, national cooperation with
AzerPost in the provision of basic accounts could be explored. The same survey also indicated that imposing
maximum balances on basic accounts may help to assuage potential Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-
Money-Laundry (AML) concerns which can hinder availability and usage of basic accounts in some
jurisdictions, while augmenting the shared use of infrastructures and access points could help reduce costs
for providers of basic accounts. To mitigate the risk that uptake and usage of basic accounts may be very

be seen as being exhaustive.


                                                                  5
low, international experience in countries such as India or the Philippines shows that the introduction of basic
accounts needs to be complemented with public awareness campaigns to promote the benefits of such
accounts.

Promote the development and provision of financial services geared towards specific needs of
customers including digital financial services (e.g. mobile financial services) and postal banking. New
business models such as mobile or agent banking can dramatically reduce the costs of delivering financial
services, in particular in low-density and remote areas. Moreover, it can not only reduce explicit costs for
those 19 percent of the financially excluded adults who reported not having an account because they are too
expensive but also implicit costs such as the opportunity cost of time lost to traveling and waiting for those 35
percent of the adult population who indicated lack of sufficient income as a main barrier to use a formal
account. It can also help to close the identified gender gap since, as shown by international evidence, women
tend to be more adoptive to technology than their male counterparts, and mobile or agent banking allows
women to avoid traveling to faraway branches and instead to start making deposits and withdrawals from a
network of agents from the convenience of their homes. The success of mobile financial services (MFS) rests
on the vast pool of agents (often small retailers) who connect remote based clients to urban centers, allowing
them to make transactions. Mobile money can make sense in Azerbaijan where mobile penetration is almost
universal. This concept encompasses a range of services, including payments (such as peer-to-peer and
government-to-person transfers), finance (such as savings, credit and insurance products), and banking
(such as account movements and balance inquiries). For mobile money to develop in an effective manner,
regulations must encourage inclusiveness, while minimizing fraud and risk. The uncertainty associated with
innovative industries operating in a nascent Azerbaijan environment means that regulations must be
incremental and proportional. Successful regulation is marked by collaborative exchange between industry,
government, and civil society. Regulation should allow agents outside of bank branches to handle financial
transactions and develop risk-based anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer requirements. To
facilitate more sophisticated service offerings, ongoing regulatory development will be necessary; for
example, mobile/e-money accounts are regulated differently from regular deposits and are subject to a
number of restrictions (e.g. no deposit insurance, prohibition of interest yields). In considering these new
regulatory issues, protection against fraud, including regular monitoring by financial regulators, is vital.

Given the very low usage of MFIs and other NBCIs, there is a strong need to encourage the
development of such institutions as an effective way to increase Azerbaijan’s low credit penetration
rate compared to its international peers. The combined microfinance loan portfolio is still only about 1
percent of GDP, despite considerable demand for microfinance services. Sector concentration is high, with
the two largest providers of microfinance, accounting for 46 percent of the market. As such, the government
of Azerbaijan should encourage the strengthening and development of MFIs in the provision of appropriate
credit instruments tailor-made to customers’ specific needs.

With a small number of people using insurance in Azerbaijan (10 percent), there is a strong need to
develop insurance services further, including life, property and liability insurance, and specific
insurance for rural areas. Total assets in the insurance sector account for less than 1 percent of GDP. Sector
segmentation is high and competition limited, and most insurance companies focus on specific and basic
products for medical, motor, life insurance and real estate. Although a number of reforms are being implemented
(legal framework, development of reinsurance, minimum capital requirements and mandatory insurance) there
is still much work to be done to encourage competition among insurance companies as well as product
innovation and improvement with the view of enhancing service quality and cost. Given the importance of crops
and livestock in the livelihood and employment of Azerbaijanis, there appears to be a need to offer insurance
products (e.g. harvest insurance, index based weather insurance, index based livestock mortality insurance)
that would allow agri-dependent households smoothing of fluctuations in rural household income due to
seasonality and mitigating of external risks associated with conducting of business.

Financial Capability
    Knowledge of basic financial concepts is a significant challenge in Azerbaijan which is
    mirrored by the fact that on average, Azerbaijan adults were able to answer 3.9 out of 7
    financial capability-related questions correctly. Azerbaijani adults are most comfortable with
    performing simple financial calculations (90 percent), identifying better bargains (79 percent) and
    understand the concept of inflation (67 percent). However, they were found to be less familiar with
    risk diversification (19 percent) and lacked the numeracy skills needed to calculate simple and
    compound interest (46 percent). An international comparison of 21 countries confirms that
    Azerbaijanis’ financial knowledge and awareness are within the norm in general. In fact, respondents
                            th              th
    in Azerbaijan ranked 9 for inflation, 10 for simple division and 19th for simple interest.
    As far as the average number of financial products known is concerned, respondents were
    familiar with products provided by 5.8 out of 8 different types of providers. Survey participants
    were found to be well aware of financial products offered by the main financial institutions, except
    brokerage houses. Product awareness reached 98 percent for banks, 89 percent for other NBCIs, 74
    percent for MFIs and MTOs, 68 percent for insurance companies, 64 percent for E-money agents, 61
    percent for money changers but only 49 percent for brokerage houses, which is most likely due to the
    fact that the capital market in Azerbaijan is currently in a nascent stage. Respondents who are the
    most familiar with financial products offered by financial providers tend to have higher income and be
    more than 54 years old.
    Azerbaijani adults showed relative strengths in using information and advice, in choosing
    financial products and, to a certain degree, they tend to be far-sighted and think about the
    future. Respondents scored highest in using information and advice for making an important financial
                 5
    decision (75) , choosing financial products (59) and farsightedness (54). On the other hand, such
    respondents scored lowest with respect to making provisions for old age expenses (21), saving and
    not overspending (25) and controlled budgeting (35).
    A comparison to respondents in fourteen countries confirms that Azerbaijani adults are
    mastering the task of choosing financial products but struggle to translate their
    farsightedness into proper long-term action. Azerbaijan is ranked third out of 14 in choosing
    financial products but in view of the aforementioned difficulties respondents faced in understanding
    simple and compound interest, it may be questionable if people always end-up selecting those
    products which best meet their needs. Moreover, the international comparison reveals that although
    Azerbaijani adults are ranked sixth out of 14 in terms of their propensity to think about the future, they
    are at the end of the pack in the area of budgeting and in making provisions for old age expenses.
    Especially the latter finding is concerning given its implications for people’s long-term well-being.
    There is no clear evidence of correlation between socio-economic characteristics and
    financial behavior scores suggesting that many people struggle with sound financial
    decisions making. Whereas urban people achieved better scores than their rural peers in a number
    of financial capability areas, including their propensity to use information and advice, save and refrain
    from overspending, they were worse off in terms of their ability to control their budgets and
    achievement orientation. Furthermore, richest people fared better than the lowest income segments
    in controlling their budgets and demonstrate higher levels of achievement orientation. However, as
    compared to lowest income earners, people living on highest incomes lack propensity to think about
    the future and to using information and advice when taking a financial decision. There only seems to
    be one characteristic which is found to be strongly associated with lower scores in a number of areas



5
  To identify the main financial capability areas in Azerbaijan, a statistical procedure known as Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
was applied. The PCA method gets a score for each financial capability areas. The scores range between 0 (lowest score) and 100
(highest score).


                                                                  7
    which is not having learned sound habits from a young age. Respondents who already saved as a
    child scored on average higher than their counterparts who did not save during their childhood.



Recommendations
Create a detailed implementation action plan to accompany the National Financial Literacy Strategy
(NFLS) which was approved by CBAR in February 2016 and show how the outcomes will be achieved.
An Action Plan is a table of actions, programs, and reforms, to be undertaken within the timeframe of
implementation of the Strategy, as agreed upon by key public and private stakeholders. The Action Plan
should address the key challenges identified through this survey and should outline (i) a concrete and self-
explanatory description of the actions to be implemented; (ii) the entity (or entities) responsible for its
execution (in the case of actions involving multiple stakeholders, a primary implementing entity is identified);
(iii) the timeframe of implementation of said action; and (iv) the priority of execution of said action (high,
medium, or low). All the actions and reforms should be presented according to the framework set in the
“Strategy Objectives” section, and signed off by the public authorities and private sector actors involved in
the implementation of the strategy.
A clear mechanism for results monitoring and impact assessment in implementation of the
recommendations of the NFLS needs to be developed and implemented as soon as possible, along
with the development of the NFLS implementation action plan. The goal of the M&E framework is to
outline a robust M&E system for the NFLS that extends beyond a simple list of national-level impact indicators
to include program-level intermediate indicators, a theory of change, coordination details, as well as an
emphasis on evaluation and improvements in data collection. This framework may also build on international
               6
best practices as well as analytical work to determine a range of ambitious yet achievable targets for each
                 7
impact indicator. The results of this survey should also be used to track progress against outcome indicators.
To scale up financial capability efforts and address areas for improvement identified through this
survey, it will be necessary to harness the potential of mass media and edutainment programs in
particular which are likely to be effective and help reach a large number of adults. Recent research has
shown that innovation on delivery matters for inducing and sustaining behavioral change. Conveying financial
messages through innovative ways such as using popular TV soap operas, films, videos or radio programs
can be quite effective, not only in improving knowledge but also in altering behavior (Berg and Zia 2013, Di
Maro et al 2014). So called edutainment programs are also presumed to be much more effective if messages
are delivered in an engaging an entertaining manner through appealing stories that stick to memories, and if
they are repeated and reinforced over time. An example how low levels of understanding of financial concepts
could be addressed is a television program, Gold for the Bold – Poles and Money, which has been developed
by the National Bank of Poland. This program gave viewers the opportunity, through questions which were
designed to be fun and entertaining, to test their knowledge of financial matters. The questions were illustrated
by film material from famous comedies or cabaret scenes. The program was shown on a popular television
channel on Sunday evenings and attracted an audience of 8 million viewers.
In addition to TV and radio programs, periodic text messages and mobile applications could be
another promising and cost-effective outreach channel. The survey results indicate that in Azerbaijan
mobile phones are the most used type of media suggesting opportunities to use this channel to reach out to
a large number of individuals and households. Studies in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines show that simple,
timely text messages reminding people to save can boost savings rates in line with earlier established goals

  This process may include projections for increases in levels of financial capability over the time span of the NFLS based on “best
performer” countries in the region and among high-income economies (providing an upper-bound target value).

                                                                    8
                                                                             8
(Karlan et al. 2010). More recently, Rodriguez and Saavedra found that financial education messages via
SMS are not effective at increasing savings, while reminders are effective at doing so. In fact, account
balances of youth who received monthly and semimonthly reminders during one year increased by 28 and
43 percent compared to those who didn’t receive any reminder. Given the high degree of mobile phone usage
in Azerbaijan, this reminder approach could induce the population to pay attention to the benefits and task of
saving as well as making provisions for old age (lowest financial capabilities according to the survey). Mobile
applications could be another promising outreach channel, especially to facilitate budget planning. A good
example of a mobile app is the mobile budget app (Mobile Financial Assistant – maFin) which has been
developed for young adults by the polish Financial Supervision Authority. This mobile app is designed to
address another area of improvement identified through this survey. Specifically, it helps monitor and analyze
personal spending and to facilitate budget planning and is available free of charge to users of mobile devices.
The provision of financial education from an early age should be encouraged as the survey results
suggest that starting early can have value. If people form sound habits on how to manage their money
from a young age, they are more likely to adhere to these throughout their lives. International evidence on
the effectiveness of school-based financial education programs in changing student behavior is mixed.
Nevertheless, there are lessons learned from other countries that have implemented such programs. For
example, the rigorous evaluation of a large scale school-based financial education program in Brazil showed
that such programs are particularly effective when financial education is provided in ways that students find
relevant to their lives either currently or in the near future, and if it is interactive (Bruhn et al. 2014). High-
quality material or textbooks are therefore required, and teachers need to be well-trained on the content and
                                                                                        9
techniques. There are a number of websites containing links to teaching resources . As existing curricula may
already be saturated, it is advisable that the financial regulator and CBAR in partnership with The Ministry of
Education integrate financial capability content into a variety of existing subjects including math, economics,
or social studies rather than adding a new subject to the curriculum. In case resources to train teachers and
to develop and provide teaching materials are limited, it may be best to focus, at least at the onset, on
incorporating financial education in one or two subjects over three or four consecutive academic semesters.
Moreover, financial education for vulnerable populations can be effectively delivered through
organizations and individuals that people trust and that they deal with in the normal course of their
lives, including teachers, social workers, employers, professional associations, sports and other
opinion leaders. Different organizations have an interest in helping people to become financially
knowledgeable and capable, in particular vulnerable populations, remote rural dwellers, low income earners,
and women. For instance, in the UK, the Financial Services Authority partnered with a range of organizations
– including housing associations; organizations supporting one-parent families; organizations supporting
prisoners and ex-offenders; organizations supporting cancer patients and their families; organizations
supporting people on low incomes; and organizations supporting people with autism – which were supported
(for example, through the funding of programs designed to develop and test resources and training-of-trainer
programs) in the delivery of financial education to their clients. In Malaysia, to highlight another example, the
Credit Counseling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) is partnering with a broad range of community-
based organizations and associations. Some of these initiatives make use of community leaders to help to
disseminate financial education information and messages. For example, AKPK is working with Jabatan
Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (JAKIM) to incorporate a personal financial education module into pre-marriage
courses and to include personal financial education topics, and their relationship to Islamic teachings, in
sermons before Friday prayers.

Financial Consumer Protection
  In general, users of financial services have expressed satisfaction with the services offered by
  financial service providers, although striking differences exist between different type of
  providers and regions. MFIs or other NBCIs fare less favorably that most other types of financial
  institutions, with insurance and MTOs earning the highest praise from consumers. At the regional level,
  there are notable differences in the dissatisfaction between regions with services provided by banks.
  The regions with the highest levels of satisfaction are the two wealthiest (Baku & Absheron and Daglig-
  Shirvan) and the one with the lowest level of satisfaction is the poorest region (Quba-Khachmaz). On
  the other hand, there are also striking differences in the dissatisfaction between regions with services
  offered by MFIs/other NBCIs. The region with the highest dissatisfaction is Lankaran and the one with
  the lowest dissatisfaction is Baku & Absheron where the financial sector is the most developed in the
  country.
  Another important finding is that 12 percent of the surveyed respondents experienced financial
  service provider conflicts, the majority of whom did not try to resolve the conflicts they
  encountered. Less than twenty percent of those Azerbaijani adults who encountered a dispute took
  actions to try to resolve it. Interestingly, twice as many of those who did not experience a conflict (40
  percent) stated that if they faced a conflict they would try to resolve it.
  In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, internal complaints handling systems and
  legal courts were barely sought by those who experienced a conflict with their financial service
  provider. The most common actions taken to try to resolve disputes were to submit a claim to the
  appropriate government authority (57 percent) and stop using the services before the contract expired
  (36 percent). Only around one out of five reportedly submitted a grievance to the company which sold
  the product (19 percent), while around 7 percent approached the legal courts.
  In general, the main causes for inertia are either related to perceived power imbalances between
  financial service providers and their clients or they relate to lack of trust in or lack of awareness
  of respective government authorities that can be approached in the event of a dispute. More than
  two thirds of those who did not take any actions to resolve a dispute reported as main reason for their
  inertia that they perceived financial institutions as being too powerful. Slightly less, 61 percent indicated
  that they think the government authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not
  aware of any government agencies they can approach for help. Slightly more than one third of those
  who did not try to solve a conflict mentioned that they did not take any actions because they think the
  law does not adequately protect consumers. Only 3 percent who did not take any actions to resolve a
  dispute declared that they are too shy to redress the dispute.


Recommendations
As a first step, a clear mandate needs to be established at the financial regulator in the area of
financial consumer protection, enforcement and redress. On February 3, 2016 the President of
Azerbaijan created a new consolidated regulatory and supervisory agency for financial services (Financial
Market Supervisory Chamber), which is taking over regulation and supervision of insurance and credit
institutions. The Financial regulator’s mandate for consumer protection and financial literacy needs to be
clarified and expanded to ensure that the regulator has explicit rights to issue consumer protection
requirements to financial institutions and apply sanctions in case of mal practices.
These findings emphasize the need to strengthen the existing financial consumer protection
framework by introducing disclosure requirements for consumer credit and all other products offered
to individual consumers to ensure consumer comprehension and satisfaction with products they are
using. It is important that customers have sufficient information to allow themselves to select financial
products that are most affordable and suitable. In line with international best practices, such as the WBG’s

                                                        10
Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection, the issuance of disclosure requirements for consumer
credit and all other products offered to individual consumers such as savings, insurance or investment
products may help to increase consumer satisfaction and comprehension of key pricing information and terms
and conditions for each product.
In a similar vein, the survey findings emphasizes the need to introduce minimum requirements for
complaints handling to ensure that adequate mechanisms in place to handle complaints fairly in-
house. In line with the WBG’s Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection, legal or regulatory
provisions should require financial institutions to provide customers with information on internal complaints
handling procedures (including contact information and time limits). This information should not only be
disclosed in their products’ terms and conditions but also be visibly posted in branches and online. In addition,
customers should be informed about formal redress systems or legal courts to increase low awareness levels
of government agencies which can be approached for help in the event of a dispute with a financial service
provider.
Expand content of the National Financial Education Website to include other financial services in
addition to banking products as well as establish special sections with information on consumer
rights and complaint handling mechanisms. Once adequate mechanisms are in place ensuring that
providers handle complaints fairly in-house, it is recommended that the authorities develop and publish a sub-
site on the National Financial education website which disseminates detailed information on the right to lodge
complaints, the manner in which complaints may be filed, and the mechanisms for how complaints are
handled (including contact information and time limits).
Enforce full compliance of financial institutions with consumer protection requirements including
information disclosure, fair advertising, complaints handling and redress, and promote sound
business practices by using adequate market conduct supervisory tools including mystery shopping
Mystery shopping can be a useful tool in the overall market conduct supervisory toolbox to assess compliance
of financial institutions with minimum standards for complaints handling or how well sales staff comply with
disclosure regulations. It can also inform consumer protection policy and measure market conduct issues
related to the quality of customer attention and suitability of financial advice, or disparate treatment of
vulnerable consumers. However, to realize the benefits of this supervisory tool, mystery shopping needs to
be well structured, the shoppers need to ask the same questions at each provider based on a simple and
plausible scenario, and it needs to cover a reasonable sample of providers and products.
Over the long-term, it is suggested to decide on the establishment of an independent alternative
dispute resolution mechanism such as a financial ombudsman. A financial ombudsman is a third party
who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial
services providers that have not been resolved by the providers, which has been implemented in many
countries such as Australia, UK, and Germany. It is usually favored for its accessibility, transparency, and low
cost as compared to courts. It also reduces the burden on courts. In addition, a financial ombudsman is well-
positioned in analyzing trends in financial consumer complaints and proposing ways of encouraging improved
business practice by financial institutions. The design of a financial ombudsman scheme can and should
respect the cultural, legal, and economic circumstances in Azerbaijan – provided it follows certain
                                                                                       10
fundamental principles. These principles, which have been summarized by the WB , include: independence;
fairness; clarity of scope and powers; effectiveness and efficiency; accessibility; transparency; and
              11
accountability . To identify the most effective institutional setup further analysis may be needed. The financial
ombudsman scheme could be fully or partly paid for by the government (out of taxation) or it could be paid

for by charging the cost to the financial industry. Because of the many other pressures on public finances, it
is more common for the cost of such a scheme to be borne by the industry from which the ombudsman work
arises – though perhaps with some upfront contribution from public funds to help initially establish the
ombudsman scheme.

Background on Azerbaijan Survey
The financial capability questionnaire used for this survey has been extensively tested in the context
of middle- and low- income countries. The survey instrument used is based on a questionnaire developed
with support by the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund and is tailored to measure financial
capability in low- and middle-income countries, although it can also be used in high-income countries.
Extensive qualitative research techniques were used to develop this survey instrument, including about 70
focus groups and more than 200 cognitive interviews in eight countries to identify the concepts that are
relevant in middle- and low- income settings, and to test and adapt the questions to ensure that they are well
understood and meaningful across income and education levels. The instrument is currently used or planned
to be used in 14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and East Asia and the Pacific.
The survey instrument used allows financial capability, financial inclusion, and consumer protection
issues to be assessed and measured. Financial capability is measured by knowledge of financial concepts
and products, and by attitudes, skills and behavior related to day-to-day money management, planning for
the future, choosing financial products and staying informed. In order to jointly analyze financial capability
and inclusion, the survey instrument captures information on usage of different kinds of financial products
and providers. The financial consumer protection section gathers information on incidence of conflicts with
financial services providers and levels of satisfaction with financial products offered by different financial
institutions. The survey instrument has been further customized to the Azerbaijan context, through adding
specific questions, for example relating to the devaluation of the Manat,
The Azerbaijan survey is representative of the financially active population and comprises a total
                         12
sample of 4,260 adults . To fulfill the requirement of a scientifically sound survey which allows inferences
to the whole universe of financially active adults in Azerbaijan, probability sampling techniques were used to
select a sample of 4,260 adults. As such, the most recent 2009 population census in the Republic of
Azerbaijan was used as a sampling frame. The population was divided into 15 strata: 8 economic regions
(Baku, Asheron, Ganja-Gazakh, Sheke-Zagatala, Lankaran, Guba-Khachmaz, Aran and Dadhlig Shirvan)
and each region, except Baku, were further divided into urban and rural strata. When the census was
conducted, the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan excluded 2 regions because of major
security reasons. There is therefore no available data for these regions, which are also excluded from the
frame of this survey and represent about 7 percent of the total population.
The sample of individual respondents within households was selected through a three stage cluster
sampling. Enumeration areas (EA) were randomly selected as primary sampling units (PSUs) with probability
proportional to size (PPS) (number of households) at the first stage, and consisted in selecting 284 primary
sampling units to reach the sample target. In each selected PSU, 15 households were randomly drawn and
targeted for surveying at the second stage. This choice of having 15 randomly drawn respondents instead of
20 per EA reduced the possible clustering effect even further. Finally, within each selected household, eligible
adults either responsible for personal or household finances were randomly drawn by means of the Kish grid.
Individual weights were calculated and used in the ensuing analysis to adjust for varying probabilities of
selection (design weights).
Between February and September 2015, a Canadian survey firm implemented the survey using
computer-assisted personal interview methods (CAPI). Étude Économique Conseil (EEC Canada), a
Montreal based consulting firm, was hired to conduct the Financial Capability Survey in Azerbaijan. To ensure
highest data quality and avoid common errors associated with paper-and-pencil surveys, an electronic version
of the questionnaire including internal consistency tests were programmed and the survey was administered
using power PCs. Due to extensive efforts and different strategies used (e.g. training of enumerators on

refusal conversion strategies, communication with respondents to inform them of the coming survey as well
as explaining the surveys’ objectives, up to 5 contact attempts at different moments during the period of the
survey, etc.) the total non-response rate was around 26.2% percent of the total sampled households. This
non-response index is very small in comparison to other non-responses observed in major surveys in
           13
Azerbaijan . Survey weights were adjusted to consider this non-response rate.
The adult population for which the results of this survey are meant to be extrapolated has the
following key characteristics: 44 percent of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 53
percent lives in rural environments (see Figure 35). Slightly less than half of the population is female (49
percent, see Figure 37). Ranking all individuals by their reported household income and dividing them into 4
groups, 26 percent of the population fall in the lowest income segment (up to 380 AZN per month), 25 percent
in the second lowest quartile (between 381 AZN and 550 AZN), 24 percent in the second highest (between
551 AZN and 780 AZN), and 25 percent in the highest income quartile (more than 781 AZN, see Figure 42).
Forty-seven percent of the population is younger than 35, 48 percent is between 35 and 55, and 5 percent of
the population is older than 55 (see Figure 42). In terms of the education level attained, 7 percent of the
population has some or completed tertiary education including university or other higher education, 90 percent
has some or completed secondary schooling, 2 percent has some or completed primary schooling while
around 1 percent of the population has no schooling at all (see Figure 40). Irregular and uncertain income
flows characterize 48 percent of the population, while the remaining 52 percent is characterized as earning
stable income, (see Figure 41). The average number of adults per household is 3, whereas an average sized
household comprises 4 people. As shown see Figure 39 in Appendix, 35 percent of the respondents live in
households with 1 to 3 members, 56 percent in households comprising 4 to 6 members, and 9 percent in
households comprising 7 to 12 members. As Table 1 presents, there are minor differences between
Azerbaijani population distribution and the surveyed population.

     1 Financial Inclusion
     1.1 Introduction
Increasing the access, usage and quality of financial products and services has become a priority in
Azerbaijan. Over the past years, Azerbaijani authorities have made considerable efforts to develop strategies
to ensure private sector participation and investment, reduce poverty and increase economic growth. In
particular, they have been working in partnership with Worldwide Development Institutions such as the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World
              14
Bank Group to increase financial inclusion levels. As part of these efforts: (i) in 2013, ADB granted a loan
of US $50 million to AccessBank Azerbaijan (ABA) to support financial inclusion. The main purpose of the
project “AZE: Access Bank Promoting Rural Financial Inclusion” is to increase lending to micro, small and
medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the underserved regions outside Baku, including secondary towns and rural
                                                                                              15
districts because MSMEs have not been well served by the traditional banking system . (ii) Azerbaijan’s
population was targeted to promote financial inclusion through financial education. Under the EBRD support,
a financial literacy training program was extended to 160,000 people in Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Georgia, Moldova and Tajikistan between 2011 and 2013. This initiative targeted the recipients of
remittances, which make up 45 per cent of GDP in the CIS countries. Nearly 27,500 new bank accounts were
opened as a result of this program and the equivalent of more than US$ 25 million was brought into formal
                      16                                                                 17
financial institutions . (iii) Azerbaijan and other ADB’s transition member countries are currently included
                                                                                           18
in a US$ $750,000 budget project focused at the qualified financial institutions (QFI) . The ultimate goal is
to improve good practice and leadership of selected QFIs. It will give an institutional diagnostic of issues to
be addressed, an identification of solutions in a consultative process involving the QFI management, and a
preparation of product- and topic-focused implementation plans including the development and testing of new
          19
products . (iv) Azerbaijani authorities have embarked on several reform initiatives to improve the operational
                                     20
and legal environment of e-money , since 2013, and most recently Islamic finance. In fact, one of Azerbaijani
government’s objectives is to launch its first Islamic bank in the short term that would use a branchless model,
                                              21
aiming to reach a wide Muslim client base . (v) The Azerbaijani authorities, with the support of the WBG,
have conducted this financial capability survey which will provide a detailed baseline for the strategies in
financial inclusion.
The information provided in this chapter will enable to fully understand the state of financial inclusion
in Azerbaijan and provide valuable inputs for interpreting the findings on financial capability.
Collecting survey data from individuals – that is, from the demand side - can provide valuable insight into the
usage, value and limitations of existing financial services. Demand-side survey data also facilitates analysis
of how patterns of financial inclusion may vary across different population segments, and the degree to which
different financial behaviors – such as saving, borrowing, and making payments – overlap. The data and
analysis presented below can be used to identify population segments, set national financial inclusion targets,
and design reforms and projects to expand financial inclusion in Azerbaijan. Finally, the data can provide a
baseline survey that can be used to measure progress of reforms and initiatives.

      1.2 Headline Measures of Financial Inclusion
According to this 2015 Financial Capability Survey, 36.4 percent of the surveyed adults in Azerbaijan
report owning an account at a formal financial institution, a commonly used metric for international
comparison. As compared to other upper-middle income economies, Azerbaijan is behind the average level
                               22
in terms of financial inclusion , commercial bank branches’ accessibility and domestic credit provided by the
financial sector (see Table 2). Global Findex shows that Azerbaijan’s financial inclusion level rose from about
15 percent in 2011 to 29 percent in 2014. The Financial Capability Survey found that such level rose to 36
percent in 2015; however, it should be noted that the Survey captures people aged 18 and above, whereas
Findex includes adolescents (15-17 years old) who typically are less financially included. When investments,
private pensions, and insurance products are included as formal financial products, the Survey finds that 47.2
percent of Azerbaijani adults use some formal financial product.

   Formal account ownership (“financially included”) is defined in Azerbaijan financial capability study as the percentage of respondents
who reported having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution (formal
credit, mortgage, credit from microfinance organizations or from the decentralized financial system, debit or credit card, formal savings,
current or savings accounts), or personally using a mobile money service in the past 12 months.

                                                                     16
Across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, income level was found to have
the most significant impact on financial inclusion, followed by whether or not adults are in the labor
force and size of household. As shown in Figure 1, regression analysis by social and demographic factors
reveals (see Table 10) that there is a strong correlation between income level and financial inclusion. In fact,
the gap in financial inclusion between the richest and the poorest quartiles is 22.9 percent, corresponding to
nearly half of that of the richest quartile. Adults who are out of the labor force were found to be 6 percent less
financially included than the average employed (see Figure 2). Size of household is correlated to financial
inclusion, however, there is only 3.1 percent average difference between smallest and largest size,
corresponding to about 8 percent of the former. Finally, the difference between urban (37.1 percent) and rural
(35.4 percent) was found not to be statistically significant (4.5 percent of urban). Global Findex and Financial
Capability Survey both show that the rural financial inclusion level is close to the average national level.

There is only a small difference in financial inclusion between genders overall but an in-depth analysis
suggests that younger women as compared to younger men have lower financial inclusion levels at
the backdrop of their lower economic participation. At first glance, Figure 1 shows almost no disparity
overall in terms of financial inclusion between male and female. However, a number of interesting findings
have allowed us to shed some light on this topic: (i) When the sample is broken down by age groups, we
note, overall, that there is marked difference of financial inclusion in favor of younger male respondents in
Azerbaijan (between ages of 18 and 20 financial inclusion is 5.2 percent higher for men). Financial inclusion
tends to become more or less gender neutral from age 21 to 55, and then it basically reverses in favor of
female Azerbaijanis (56 and more financial inclusion is 5.7 percent higher for women). This pattern clearly
demonstrates differences between the younger generations of women as compared to their elders. (ii)
                                                                             23
According to the World Economic Forum’s 2015 Global Gender Gap report which measures gender equality
                                                                     th
in health, education, economy, and politics, Azerbaijan ranks 96 out of 145 countries below many other
developing countries with similar income levels. More interestingly, Azerbaijan’s Gender Gap index has
materially deteriorated from 2007 to 2015. Particularly, in terms of economic participation and opportunity for
                                                                                th
women, Azerbaijan’s ranking dropped significantly from 4th in 2008 to 54 in 2015. Such a trend points
towards the widening gender gap for the younger generation which seems to find its roots in education
choices at younger ages, with an impact on financial participation and inclusion in later years. (iii) Differences
in account ownership between the younger and older generations of women may also be explained by the
fact that Azerbaijani women aged 21 and older are more likely to be married and to own an account jointly
with their spouses.

Regional differences do exist in respect of financial inclusion, however, they remain small to
moderate. As shown in Map 1, Ganja-Qazakh has the highest level at 38.3 percent, which is 5.2 percent
above the national average. Shaki-Zaqatala has the lowest level at 32.3 percent, which is 11.3 percent below
the national average. The next highest levels are in Daglig-Shirvan and Baku-Absheron where financial
inclusion is 3.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively above the national average.

       1.3 Usage of Financial Products
The next sections dig deeper into the types of institutions and specific products used by Azerbaijani
adults, both within and outside the formal financial system. The analysis is organized by type of financial
institution. Each section documents overall awareness of a given institution among respondents, explores
patterns of historical usage, i.e. whether a respondent has ever used that institution, and the current usage.


       1.3.1 Usage of Banks
About one third of the population has a bank account, however, almost everybody whether men or
women, urban or rural, rich or poor, knows about services offered by banks. The only notable difference
is that there are about 17 percent more rich people having bank accounts than the poor (see Table 11). As
shown in Figure 3, 34 percent of the population currently has a formal bank account, 84 percent claim having
used banks in the past and 98 percent knows about services offered by banks. All such figures are the same
whether women or men, and almost the same between urban and rural, except that there are 4 percent more
urban people having bank accounts than their rural counterparts.

Usage of bank accounts does vary moderately between regions and correlation does exist between
usage of bank accounts and regional wealth. As shown in Map 2, the spread between highest and lowest
usage of bank account is 9 percent. As Table 3 presents, there is a connection between the level of wealth
as measured by income per capita and holding of bank accounts.

There is a strong negative correlation between historical usage of banks and current holding of bank
accounts. As shown in Table 4 and Map 3, regions with high usage of banks in the past tend to have the
lowest holding of bank accounts at present and vice versa. This may suggest that a non-negligible proportion
of users of banks in the past were dissatisfied and decided to revert to other mechanisms (refer to chapter 3
Financial Consumer Protection for more details).

Bank credit is used by 15 percent of the population and increasing steadily and formal credit is the
most utilized form, representing about twice as much as credit card. About four percent more people
utilize bank credit in urban than in rural areas. About 3 percent more people have credit cards in Baku than
in the rest of the country. As shown in Figure 4, formal credit stands at 15 percent followed by credit card (8
percent). As of September 1, 2015, the volume of credit allocated by banks was AZN 20,095.8 million and
increased by 16.1 percent during the past 12 months (in comparison with previous year the increase was
                27
19.7 percent) . Formal credit represents 7 percent more than credit card. Urban population is the highest
user of formal credit (16 percent) and credit card (9 percent) compared to their rural peers (12 percent and 7
percent respectively). Credit cards are used mostly by people living in Baku; in fact, 12 percent of Baku
inhabitants hold credit cards versus 8 percent nationally. On the other hand, most bank account holders
(about 22 percent) own a debit card, mostly utilized by rich people (32 percent) by more than 18 percent of
poor people.

Long term finance, a credit method in expansion, is used by 7 percent of the population: in particular,
urban dwellers and habitants of Baku. As shown in Figure 5,33 percent more people utilize mortgages in
urban than in rural areas. This kind of financing is used mostly by people living in Baku; in fact, 11 percent of
Baku residents have a mortgage compared to the national average of 7 percent. The system of mortgage
credit in Azerbaijan was restructured at the end of 2005 with the establishment of Azerbaijan Mortgage Fund

expanded since its creation. At the end of 2015, 74 times more mortgage loans were granted in comparison

About one person out of 10 uses MTOs, predominantly from poor and large households in urban
areas especially Baku. As seen in Figure 6, 12 percent of the population currently has money transfer
products and more than one third has used such products in the past. Furthermore, 3 out of 4 persons know
about services offered by MTOs. Such services were found to be utilized by 30 percent more people in urban
areas (especially Baku), by 33 percent more people from poor households and by about 20 percent more
people living in the largest households. Such facts underpin the notion that poor people receive more financial
support from family and friends. In fact, 37 percent of poor households declare receiving this kind of support
as household income source, while only 15 percent of richest household affirm the same. MTO usage is
linked to remittance trend in Azerbaijan. In particular, Azerbaijan is in the top remittances sending countries
    th                                         th
(25 position in worldwide classification and 8 position among middle income economies). Such remittances
                                                        30
represent about 2.7 percent of GDP (2.0 US billions).

Usage of money transfer services varies significantly between regions and correlation exists between
usage of such services and regional wealth. As shown in Map 4, the spread between highest and lowest
usage of money transfer services is more than 70 percent of the national average. As shown in Table 5, there
is a relationship between the level of wealth and usage of such services. On the other hand, when this regional
usage is compared to percentage of households who declared having received help from family or friends
abroad (see Map 5), there is no correlation except for Daglig-Shirvan. This is not surprising as Azerbaijan is
classified as a sender of remittances instead of a receiver.

     1.3.2.2 Usage of E-money Agents

      Electronic money (e-money)-based instruments: In general terms, these instruments involve
      the payer maintaining a pre-funded transaction account with a PSP [Payment Service Provider],
      often a non-banking entity. Specific products include online money when the payment instruction
      is initiated via the internet, and mobile money when initiated via mobile phones and prepaid cards.


Usage of E-money products is almost inexistent although one out of five persons has used such
products in the past, suggesting appropriate measures are needed to develop a sector in its
embryonic stage. Although roughly 65 percent of the population knows about services offered by E-money
agents and approximately one in five persons have used E-money products in the past, only 0.3 percent
currently utilizes such service. There are no gender differences, however, no one uses this service in rural
areas, and 40 percent more rich than poor people utilize it. These results are coherent with the 2014 Global
Findex indicators where less than 0.1 percent of Azerbaijan adults reported having sent or received money
through mobile phones. Recent research stresses the “importance of the execution of a new strategy and
implementation of legal reforms on the payment service market for the purpose of expanding financial
inclusion and providing payment services in untraditional ways by payment and electronic money institutions
                             33
and their payment agents” .

E-money is a relatively new concept in Azerbaijan. The rules for issuing e-money were prepared through
                                                                                      34
the passage of a relevant draft law, which reached its final stage at the end of 2013. This bill will enable
Azerbaijani banks and local branches of foreign banks to issue e-money. In addition, the draft law provides
the legal and regulatory framework for opening new branches and representative offices of foreign payment
organizations active in the country. All institutions working in the field of e-money need a license, the
authorized capital needs to exceed the minimum threshold set by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) and
certain obligations must be met by service providers to ensure the safety of customer funds (e.g. unique
                                                           35

     1.3.2.3 Microfinance                    Institutions            and        Other          Non-Bank             Credit
            Institutions
Although almost everybody knows about MFIs and other NBCIs and 23 percent of adults have used
their services in the past, only 6 percent have a credit with such institutions – mainly rural rich people,
suggesting there is a need for sector reform and development. In fact, one of the main policy
                                                    36
recommendations mentioned by the World Bank is “promoting sustainable funding facilities for financial
service providers (particularly NBCIs) to increase funding to currently underserved segments”. As shown in
Figure 7, 97 percent of the population knows about MFIs or other NBCIs such as credit unions, there is no
variation between male and female, but there are 2 percent more users in rural areas and 9 percent more
rich people with a credit at MFIs or NBCI. As shown in Figure 8 and Table 11, holding of an MFI / non-bank
credit is strongly correlated to people’s income level as well as holding of bank account.

The microfinance sector association, AMFA, has made an important contribution to sector
development in line with international good practices. Microfinance first started in Azerbaijan in the mid-
1990s with the participation of international NGOs, and over time, the sector grew steadily. The number of
                                                                                  37
NBCIs, including credit unions, was 157 as of end-2014, with 212 branches. Even so, microfinance has
                                                                                              38
not yet reached its potential. This fact has been strongly highlighted by the World Bank : “The non-bank
credit sector is underdeveloped and offers limited opportunities for Azerbaijani SMEs.” The combined
microfinance loan portfolio is still only about 1 percent of GDP, despite considerable demand for microfinance
services. Sector concentration is high, with the two largest providers of microfinance, Accessbank and FINCA,
together accounting for 46 percent of the market. The legal and regulatory environment for microfinance
organizations is relatively new and may still require improvement, including in the key area of capacity building
                 39
for supervision.

       1.3.2.4 Insurance Companies
Approximately one half of the population has used an insurance product in the past but less than one
out of ten persons and in particular only 3 percent of rural people currently has an insurance policy,
suggesting a strong need for sector reform and development. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 9, 30
percent of the population has no idea about services offered by insurance companies. Nevertheless, there
seems to be no connection between usage of insurance products and gender as well as income level. Usage
of insurance products tends to increase with household size; however there is a notable difference between
urban and rural areas (see regression analysis in Table 11). In fact, there are four times more urban than rural
people who currently have an insurance policy. This is rather astonishing, especially for agriculture in rural areas
where there are few buyers of harvest insurance that allows to smooth fluctuations in household income due to
seasonality.
Insurance is still nascent in Azerbaijan and the sector remains small, although the government has
started to support its development by strengthening the environment and introducing mandatory
insurance. Unfortunately, between 1995 and 2003 the total number of insurance companies declined from 71
to 29. By 2012, the sector comprised of 29 insurance companies, 1 reinsurer, 7 brokers, about 200 agents, and
the Association of Azerbaijani Insurers. Total assets accounted for less than 1 percent of GDP. The industry is
moderately concentrated, with the 10 leading insurers accounting for 75 percent of premiums in 2012. Many
insurance companies are linked with banks. However, most insurance companies focus on specific products,
                                                           41
such as medical, motor, life insurance and real estate . In summary, sector segmentation is high and
competition limited, thereby having a negative impact on quality and product cost.

Various reforms under the Poverty Reduction Program 2008–2015 are being implemented . Such
reforms involve an improvement in the legal framework, encouraging the development of reinsurance,
establishing insurance associations, improved control over insurance activities, and a single register on foreign
reinsurers and insurance brokers. Actual reforms have moved along these lines with the enactment of a new
insurance law and the establishment of associations. In addition, minimum capital requirements for insurance
companies have been increased and various types of mandatory insurance established to create a mass market
for insurance products.

Usage of insurance varies significantly between regions and there is a correlation between usage of
such services and regional wealth. As shown in Map 7, the spread between highest and lowest usage of
insurance services is more than 10 percent. As Table 6 presents, it is notable to see that the largest users of
insurance products are based in Baku/Absheron and Daglig-Shirvan, the two wealthiest regions in Azerbaijan.

     1.3.2.5 Brokerage Houses
Although more than one out of 3 persons have used brokerage house products in the past, a very
small fraction of people currently has investments, whether male or female, urban or rural, rich or
poor, which may highlight the lack of trust or interest in such products. 49 percent of the population
knows about the services offered by brokerage houses and 36 percent utilized investment products in the
past. However, only a mere 0.3 percent of persons are currently holding an investment, maybe due to bad
performance. Rich people seem to know more about such products (57 percent) by a factor of 1.24 and have
utilization rate 12 percent higher than poor people (45 percent versus 33 percent of poor people). These
results may also be associated to the fact that the brokerage industry is concentrated in Baku. In fact, there
is only one authorized stock exchange in Azerbaijan, the Baku Stock Exchange (BSE). Furthermore, there
are very few participants in the securities market: 12 brokerage companies, 13 dealers, 3 securities

According to Global Findex database , studies indicate that access to savings products, including
project savings (or "blocked") in which the person agrees not to withdraw funds until it has achieved a
preset goal, can provide significant benefits that go well beyond the simple ability of an individual to
save: it also contributes to the emancipation of women, to boost productive investment and consumption, drive
up productivity and incomes, or to increase spending on preventive care. A current or deposit account can be a
stepping stone to full financial inclusion by opening the way for a wider range of responsible financial services
provided by more robust and diversified financial institutions. There is new evidence that access to financial
services through formal accounts can enable individuals and companies to smooth consumption, manage risk
and invest in education, health and new projects. According to a recent Aker’s study, the use of a deposit
account at a bank or other formally regulated financial institution varies widely across regions, economies, and
individual characteristics. Worldwide, 50 percent of adults report having an individual or joint account at a formal
financial institution, according to data from the Global Findex database (Demirgüç-Kunt and Klapper, 2012).
Indeed, Global Findex data also highlights the important role that deposit accounts can play in the financial lives
of adults in low-income countries when they do indeed have accounts, especially with regard to the receipt of
formal payments, such as wages, government transfers, or remittances. In Azerbaijan, banks are already
relatively successful in mobilizing domestic deposits, although more needs to be done. Bank deposits of
                                                              47
population increased by 4.7% during September 2014-2015 and reached 7,320.3 million AZN.
Less than half of the population currently has savings split 50/50 between informal and formal methods.
As demonstrated in Figure 10, 45 percent of people save money, broken down as follows: (i) 18 percent - only
formal or having a deposit / checking account; (ii) 18 percent - only informal; and (iii) 8 percent both formal and
informal. Propensity to save was found to be slightly higher in urban areas (25 percent more than rural) and
women (18 percent more than men).

Almost 60 percent of people holding formal accounts in a financial institution did not save in the last 12
months and among those who saved, almost 50 percent kept money at home, and the others used
mainly saving accounts or credit union/MFI services. As shown in Figure 11, 58 percent of people who
used a formal account did not save money. Among those who saved (see Figure 12), 46 percent saved cash
at home or in a wallet, 21 percent paid money into a savings account, 15 percent kept money in a credit union
or MFI and 10 built up a balance in a bank account. In Baku, among banked people who saved, two third of
them keep money at home and the remaining utilize their savings or current account; as such, no one was
reported to keep money in credit unions or MFI. Propensity to save was found to be predominant among rich
banked people. In particular, as Figure 13 presents, while 32 percent of rich banked Azerbaijanis saved in the
last year through formal financial channels, only 2 percent of poor banked Azerbaijanis did the same.

Approximately half of the population does not borrow money and among those who borrow money,
informal credit is the preferred mechanism. Furthermore, there are 11 percent more poor people than rich
having an informal credit and 6 percent more rich than poor having a formal credit. As witnessed in Figure
14, 51 percent of the population has no credit whatsoever. Informal credit is the most popular borrowing
method with 15 percent more than formal credit. There is little difference between men and women in
borrowing statistics overall. Nevertheless, variations worthwhile mentioning are in respect of socioeconomic
and demographic factors. In fact, there are 27 percent of informal credits among the poor and 20 percent
formal credits among the rich. These findings seem to confirm the argument that poor people are more likely
to work as independent or informally in the private sector than their rich counterpart, and as such are less
liable to obtain a bank credit.

There is a credit pattern differentiation across regions in Azerbaijan, whereby Baku/Absheron
displays the highest level of borrowing and Shaki-Zaqatala the lowest. As presented in Map 8 and Map
9, the maximum variation in formal and informal borrowing represents 38 percent and 42 percent of the
national average respectively. For both formal and informal borrowing, Baku/Absheron has the highest
ranking. The lowest ranking for formal borrowing is shared between Shaki-Zaqatala and Lankaran, and the
lowest level of informal borrowing resides in Shaki-Zaqatala and Ganja-Qazakh. Save for the Baku region
there seems to be a clear pattern whereby informal credit is higher in regions in which formal credit is lower,
thus informal credit appears to be a substitute for formal sources of credit in credit-constrained regions.

     1.4 The Unbanked and Barriers to Owning a Formal
         Account
The approximately 4 million adults without an account at a formal financial institution in Azerbaijan
                                                                  50
are disproportionately poor and outside of the labor force. Seventy-three percent of the lowest income
quartile of Azerbaijanis report not currently having an account at a formal financial institution. The same
applies for sixty-eight percent of adults who are outside of the labor force. Yet, as stated in the Global
Financial Development Report 2014 (World Bank, 2013a), lack of usage of financial products does not
necessarily mean lack of access. While some people may have access to financial services at affordable
prices and may decide not to use them, others may lack access because of constraints such as excessively
high costs, or unavailability of the services due to regulatory barriers or other factors. The Financial Capability
Survey asked respondents who do not have a formal account to report why.




49
   White regions were excluded from the Survey.
50
   Due to the design of the survey, obstacles to financial access are assessed specifically with respect to account ownership and thus
this may include adults who do in fact use other formal financial services such as insurance or pensions.

                                                                   36
Figure 15. Reasons for Not Having a Formal Account (% of Unbanked Azerbaijanis Without an Account)

Most people not owning a formal account claim not to need it or do not have enough money to use it
and a smaller group of people think it is too expensive to hold such an account. Such findings suggest
that people may perceive low value in banking services especially when using small amounts. As exhibited
in Figure 15, 39 percent of those adults believe there is no need for an account, 35 percent say they do not
have sufficient funds and 19 percent think it is too expensive. While these answers could suggest voluntary
exclusion from the formal financial sector, it does not necessarily imply that these adults are not bankable.
Instead, it may demonstrate that many adults perceive banking services to be of little value, not in absolute
terms, but for current levels of income and the quality of banking products. This could be because of the
nontrivial costs associated with owning a formal account, from explicit costs like minimum balance
requirements and withdrawal charges to implicit costs such as transportation costs, but it suggests that, for
many adults, formal institutions do not offer sufficiently valuable services for day-to-day transactions or
savings, particularly those involving small amounts. In terms of gender, Figure 15 shows that almost the same
majority proportion of unbanked men and women don’t need a formal account (39 percent versus 40 percent).
However, while four percent more of unbanked men declare that they don’t have enough money to use a
formal account (37 percent versus 33 percent), two percent more of unbanked women consider that it is too
expensive to maintain a formal account or they do not trust them.




                                                        37
The percentage of unbanked Azerbaijanis is likely to be related to the lack of competition in
Azerbaijan’s highly concentrated banking sector, which at times may not allow people to own
accounts or borrow on favorable terms- especially outside the capital Baku. Most of Azerbaijan’s 39
banks are small. More than half of banks account for only about 10 percent of sector assets. One exception
is the remaining state-owned bank, International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), which still accounts for 34 percent
of banking sector assets. High interest rate margins suggest that the efficiency of Azerbaijan’s financial sector
can be further increased. The Azerbaijani banking sector is characterized by market segmentation that results
from special relations between banks and current or former government officials, and groups of private or
state-owned enterprises; a difficult business climate marked, among other things, by weak rule of law, which
increases risks for banks; and, to a certain extent, IBA’s strong market position, which makes it difficult for
                                           51
other banks to realize economies of scale . Banking is highly concentrated in the capital, Baku, as shown in
section 1.3.1. Financial sector concentration in Baku, to some extent, reflects the concentration of
Azerbaijan’s economic activity on the Absheron peninsula, which includes the Baku and Sumqyavit region.
Absheron is not only the center of the oil and gas industries, but also other heavy industries (chemical and
metallurgy) and of the light and food industries. However, Absheron accounts for only 29 percent of
Azerbaijan’s total population. Even though, under a government program, the number of bank branches, bank
accounts, ATMs, and point-of-sale terminals has continuously increased, many shops and restaurants still do
not have these terminals or, if they do, avoid running card transactions to minimize cost.

The continuous decline of oil prices, and the ensuing free floating of the Manat, led to a series of bank
closures, while Azerbaijan moved towards the full insurance of personal deposits in banks to
reassure depositors. Against this backdrop, regulation on bank capitalization and securitization is being
reinforced. Even with multilateral support, weaknesses remain that have to be addressed by improving bank
                                             52
governance as well as banking supervision.

        2 Financial Capability
     Financial Capability is the internal capacity to act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic
     environmental conditions. It therefore encompasses the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors of
     consumers with regard to managing their resources and understanding, selecting, and make use of
     financial services that fit their needs.


        2.1 Knowledge of Financial Concepts
There is substantial evidence that lack of financial knowledge and skills contributed to the recent
global financial crisis. It is a well-accepted hypothesis that limitations in consumers’ ability to fully
understand the financial products and risks they had taken on, contributed significantly to the worst financial
crises since the great depression (Geradi et al. 2010; Klapper et al. 2012).
Financial knowledge and skills are even more important in an environment where financial products
and services are becoming available to populations that have been formerly disconnected from the
formal financial system. While these developments provide benefits, they also bear risks that may be
unfamiliar to existing and new customers. To be able to benefit from these new opportunities without being
exposed to undue risks, a certain level of financial knowledge and skills is required.
In line with global trends, policy makers in Azerbaijan recognize the importance of financial
knowledge and skills (financial literacy) for peoples’ ability to take informed financial decisions and
to benefit from the financial services they use. Financial supervisors in 81 economies are currently
involved in financial capability enhancing activities according to the WBG’s 2013 Global Survey on Consumer
Protection and Financial Literacy which interviewed regulators involved in financial consumer protection in
114 jurisdictions from all regions. Financial capability and education are an important priority for CBAR as it
helps to empower people to become effective partners of these institutions as productive economic agents
and improves people’s lives. To this end, CBAR developed a national financial literacy strategy (NFLS) and
a financial education website. Since 2010, CBAR has incorporated and launched, under its mission plan, the
Financial Literacy Project with four main objectives: “(a) make customers economically and financially more
educated and skillful, (b) educate parents through children, (c) make changes to financial behavior of people,
                                                                     53
(d) inspire corporate social responsibility, and (e) mitigate risks”. This chapter focuses on gaps in financial
knowledge that need policy attention as well as vulnerable groups that display limited knowledge and
understanding of financial concepts and need to be targeted with tailored programs.
To assess respondent’s financial knowledge and their basic numeracy skills, 7 questions were added
to the 2015 Azerbaijan Financial Capability Survey, covering basic computation and financial concepts
such as interest rates, inflation, compound interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of insurance
products. These questions have been asked because they capture financial concepts and skills which are
widely considered as being crucial for informed savings and borrowing decisions as well as for being able to
manage risks more effectively and/or take advantage of investment opportunities. A financial literacy index is
obtained based on the number of correct responses provided by each survey participant to the seven financial
literacy questions. This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who incorrectly answer all
of these questions, while a score of 7 indicates survey participants with a good understanding of fundamental
financial concepts and the ability to perform simple mathematical calculations. Box 1 details questions from
the financial literacy quiz.

Box 1. Financial Literacy Quiz

  Question 1 Imagine that five brothers are given a gift of 1,000 AZN. If the brothers have to divide the
  money equally, how much does each one get?
  Question 2 Now, imagine that the five brothers have to wait for one year to get their part of the 1,000
  AZN and inflation stays at 10%. In one year’s time will they be able to buy:
  •   More with their share of money than they could today
  •   The same amount
  •   Less than they could buy today
  •   It depends on the types of things that they want to buy (do not read out this option)
  Question 3 Suppose you put 1,000 AZN into a savings account with a guaranteed interest rate of 2%
  per year. You don’t make any further payments into this account and you don’t withdraw any money.
  How much would be in the account at the end of the first year, once the interest payment is made?
  Question 4 How much would be in the account at the end of five years? Would it be:
  •   More than 110 AZN
  •   Exactly 110 AZN
  •   Less than 110 AZN
  •   It is impossible to tell from the information given
  Question 5 Let’s assume that you saw a TV-set of the same model on sales in two different shops. The
  initial retail price of it was 1,000 AZN. One shop offered a discount of 150 AZN, while the other one
  offered a 10% discount. Which one is a better bargain, a discount of 150 AZN or 10%?
  •   A discount of 150 AZN
  •   They are the same
  •   A 10% discount
  Question 6 Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose of insurance
  products?
  •   To accumulate savings
  •   To protect against risks
  •   To make payments or send money
  •   Other
  Question 7 Suppose you have money to invest. Is it safer to buy stocks of just one company or to buy
  stocks of many companies?
  •   Buy stocks of one company
  •   Buy stocks of many companies

The survey results suggest that on average respondents were able to correctly answer 3.9 out of 7
questions on financial literacy. Figure 16 reveals that the majority of Azerbaijanis adults (60 percent) were
able to provide between 3 and 4 correct answers. 22 percent of the sample was able to answer 5 questions
correctly. Giving correct responses to 6 or more questions seemed to be a difficult task which was only
achieved by 7 percent, while only 0.80 percent was able to provide correct responses to all 7 financial literacy
questions. Around 11 percent of adults were able to only give 1 or 2 correct answers.

A deeper exploration into the type of basic financial concepts knowledge reveals that Azerbaijanis
adults are most comfortable with performing simple financial calculations, identifying better bargains
and understanding the concept of inflation. However, they were found to be less familiar with risk
diversification and lacked the numeracy skills needed to calculate simple and compound interest. As Figure
17 shows almost all respondents were able to perform simple divisions (90 percent). Most people seemed
to be comfortable in solving simple numeracy tasks (90 percent), identifying better bargains (79 percent) and
understanding the concept of inflation (67 percent). 51 percent of Azerbaijani adults were familiar with the
purpose of insurance. However, most respondents struggled to understand basic financial concepts and to
solve slightly more difficult numeracy tasks (35 percent and 46 percent of the sample demonstrated
understanding of simple interests and compound interest respectively). Furthermore, only 19 percent
understood the concept of risk diversification (i.e. holding stocks from different companies can usually be
associated with less risky returns than holding stocks from a single entity). This underpins the Survey’s
findings concerning very low usage of brokerage houses by Azerbaijanis as discussed previously in section
1.3.2.5.

An international comparison of 21 countries confirms that Azerbaijanis’ financial knowledge and
awareness are within the norm in general, except for interest rate calculation. Table 7 shows for 22
countries the proportion of adults with good grasp of basic financial concepts. As can be seen, respondents

There is a strong mismatch between self-assessment of financial literacy and quiz proficiency on all
4 major concepts and therefore an awareness campaign would likely be useful. In order to compare the
objective findings of the financial literacy quiz into the context of subjective education needs, respondents
were also asked to self-assess their awareness and understanding of financial terms and concepts such as
interest rates, insurance products, shares, exchange rates and inflation. As outlined in Figure 18, although
34 percent of respondents declared having heard of or knowing what inflation meant, 67 percent correctly
answered the financial quiz question pertaining to this topic. As demonstrated in Figure 19, on the topic of
inflation, 43 percent of respondents reported a lack of understanding but answered correctly and 11 percent
reported understanding but answered incorrectly. Similar results were found for interest rates (14 and 20
percent respectively) and insurance (37 and 27 percent respectively). A more worrisome result was found
whereby 37 percent of respondents reported understanding of interest rates but answered incorrectly, which
is a major obstacle for getting and managing a formal credit.

 Box 2. Media Consumption Overview


   95 percent of adults in Azerbaijan use a mobile phone on a regular basis and the second most used
   media source is TV (90 percent) followed by internet (70 percent). As shown in Figure 20, the usage of
   mobile phones is nearly universal, even among those at the bottom of the pyramid. TV and internet usage is
   not significantly affected by gender, urban/rural split, education level nor income levels (4 percent gap
   between lowest and highest income earners for internet only), suggesting that a lack of proper coverage would
   be the main impediment for people who want to access.

      2.2 Knowledge of Financial Products
 In order to assess survey participants’ awareness levels of financial products the financial capability
 survey captured peoples’ familiarity with financial products offered by different types of formal and
 informal providers. In particular, survey participants were asked if they were familiar with products offered
 by banks, MFIs, other NBCIs, insurance companies, money changers, MTOs, brokerage houses, and E-
 money agents. A financial products awareness index was designed based on the number of financial products
 known to survey participants. This index ranges from 0 to 8, whereby 0 indicates respondents who are not
 familiar with any of the products offered in the marketplace. Respondents with a score of 8 on the other hand
 stated familiarity with products offered by the nine types of providers that the survey asked about.
 Respondents were found to be familiar with products provided by 5.8 different types of providers. As
 can be seen in Figure 21, nearly two thirds of the sample indicated to be familiar with 4-6 products, while 30
 percent was familiar with financial products provided by 7-8 different providers. All were aware of at least 1
 product.

Survey participants were found to be well aware of financial products offered by banks, MFIs and
other NBCIs, as well as MTOs. In descending order (see Figure 22), product awareness reached 98 percent
for banks, 89 percent for other NBCIs, 74 percent for MFIs and MTOs, 68 percent for insurance companies,
64 percent for E-money agents, 61 percent for money changers but only 49 percent for brokerage houses,
which is most likely due to the fact that the capital market in Azerbaijan is currently in a nascent stage.

Respondents who are the most familiar with financial products offered by financial providers tend to
have higher income and be more than 54 years old. As Figure 23 and Figure 24 show and regression
analysis suggests that even after controlling for other socioeconomic and demographic factors (see Table
16), level of income and age were found to be correlated to awareness of products from a variety of financial
services providers.

     2.3 Financial Behavior and Attitudes
Even if people possess knowledge of basic financial concepts and products they may struggle to
translate all this into action. To identify the role that attitudes play in shaping individuals' financial decisions
and to see if and how attitudes translate into financial behavior, the survey contains questions on different
components of financial capability that include attitudes, motivations and behaviors. This chapter gives an
overview of strengths and areas for improvements respondents show regarding relevant financial behaviors
and attitudes.
In the Azerbaijan data set, 7 main components of financial capability can be identified, some of which
refer to behaviors, and others to attitudes or motivations. The Financial Capability and Inclusion Survey
in Azerbaijan recorded different financial attitudes, motivations and behaviors through diverse qualitative
questions with various measurement levels (nominal and ordinal). To identify the main components of
financial capability in Azerbaijan, a statistical procedure was applied to simultaneously quantify categorical
variables while reducing the dimensionality of the data. This procedure known as Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) reduces the original set of variables to a smaller uncorrelated set of variables (principal
                                                                                                            54
components) which aim to account for as much of the variance in the data as possible. The PCA method
gets a single indicator (or score) for each component. The scores range between 0 (lowest score) and 100
(highest score). Table 8 presents the relevant attitudes that define each component.

   The PCA analysis performed in Azerbaijan has focused on eleven main components that account for 70 percent of the total variance.
Other dimensions were ignored because of their lower contribution to total variance. Principal components having eigenvalues greater
than 1 were also prioritized.

Survey participants showed relative strengths in using information and advice, choosing financial
products and to a certain degree farsightedness, but areas of weakness were identified in planning
for old age, saving/not overspending and controlled budgeting. As depicted in Figure 25, respondents
scored highest for using information and advice (75 percent), choosing financial products (59 percent) and
farsightedness (54 percent). On the other hand, such respondents scored lowest in planning for old age (21
percent), saving and not overspending (25 percent) and controlled budgeting (35 percent). Although they
seem to have forward oriented attitudes and think about the future, this does not seem to translate into
concrete actions in terms of putting money aside and making provisions for old age expenses.

A comparison to survey participants in 14 countries confirms that Azerbaijani adults tend to perform
well in terms of farsightedness and choosing financial products, but they are among the most
challenged in monitoring expenses and planning for old age. As shown in Table 9, Azerbaijan is ranked
third out of 14 in choosing financial products and sixth in farsightedness. However, it is last in controlled
budgeting and before last in planning for old age.

There is no clear evidence of correlation between socio-economic characteristics and financial
behavior scores suggesting that many people struggle with sound financial decision making. As
demonstrated in Figure 26, whereas urban people achieved better scores than their rural peers in a number
of financial capability areas, including their propensity to use information and advice, save and refrain from
overspending, they were worse off in terms of their ability to control their budgets and their achievement
orientation. Furthermore, richest people fared better than the lowest income segments in controlling their
budgets and demonstrate higher levels of achievement orientation. However, as compared to lowest income
earners, people living on highest incomes lack behind in respect of their propensity to think about the future
and using information and advice when taking a financial decision. As shown in Figure 27, older people (more
than 54 years old) tend to do slightly better than their younger peers when planning for old age; however the
latter have a small edge in the saving department.

Starting to save at an early age has value. As shown in Figure 28, respondents who already saved as a
child score on average higher than their counterpart group who did not save during their childhood with
respect to saving dimensions in financial behaviors. The gap between these subcategories of respondents is
18 percentage points. Regression analysis confirms this observed difference.

        Box 3. Manat Devaluation Perception

      Falling oil prices coupled with reduction of oil production and deteriorating economic situation in
      Russia led to lower economic growth in Azerbaijan and a 30 percent devaluation of the Manat in
                      r1
      February 2015 . During the last decade, the Azerbaijan economy experienced rapid growth, peaking at 35
      percent in 2006, thanks to the increasing export of oil products on favorable terms. However, oil production
      started to peak between 2011 and 2013 and the continuing fall in oil prices and economic difficulties in Russia
      led to a slowdown in oil production and economic growth in 2014, which caused the Azerbaijani Manat to be
      devalued by 30 percent in February 2015.

      Based on the Survey, almost 80 percent of Azerbaijanis experienced a slight lowering of their standard
      of living since the devaluation of the Manat. As shown in Figure 29, the remaining 20 percent is split about
      50/50 between Azerbaijanis who believe that their standard of living has not changed and those who think
      that their quality of life was severely diminished.

      Furthermore, 80 percent of Azerbaijanis stated that price levels have slightly increased since the
      devaluation. As depicted in Figure 29, the remaining 20 percent is split about 50/50 between Azerbaijanis
      who believe that prices remained stable and those who declare that prices increased significantly. However,
                                            r2
      the Ministry of Economy of Azerbaijan witnessed an increase in the purchasing power of the population. In
      fact, during the period January-September 2015, average population income increased by 4.5 percent which
      is 0.8 percent higher than inflation.

     3 Financial Consumer Protection
In addition to peoples’ ability to take sound financial decisions, the latest global financial crisis has
highlighted the importance of financial consumer protection to protect consumers from abusive sale
practices and to level the playing field between providers and consumers of financial services.
Financial consumer protection is about ensuring a fair interaction between providers and consumers of
financial services. An effective financial consumer protection regime is essential in counterbalancing the
inherent disadvantage of financial services consumers’ vis-à-vis the power, information, and resources of
their providers. Without basic protective measures, consumers may find it difficult or costly to obtain sufficient
information or adequately understand the financial products they use.
Financial consumer protection is necessary to ensure stable financial markets in Azerbaijan while
ensuring that expanded access benefits consumers and the overall economy. As outlined in section
1.1, given the low level of financial inclusion in Azerbaijan a number of initiatives are planned or already
underway to increase financial sector outreach to formally excluded populations. Increased access to finance
can result in substantial positive effects, both on the macro as well as individual level. However, it can be
harmful if inexperienced consumers are not protected against fraud or unfair business practices. Effective
financial consumer protection frameworks are also critical for instilling trust in the formal financial system. A
high incidence of conflicts with financial services providers or low levels of satisfaction with financial products
used could undermine the trust in the formal financial system. Despite making existing consumers worse off,
it can also discourage potential new consumers to enter the market.
This chapter assesses the effectiveness of the current financial consumer protection regime from a
demand-side perspective, with a focus on consumers’ satisfaction with financial products and
services and consumer redress and dispute resolution. In order to measure whether products are
effectively meeting the needs of financially included Azerbaijani adults, the financial capability survey sought
to capture the overall satisfaction of consumers with the nine most common types of providers and their
products and services. To examine the effectiveness of existing consumer redress mechanisms, this survey
also asked users of financial services to share their experiences with current internal and external redress
mechanisms, and identified segments of the population that are more likely to have encountered a conflict
with a financial service provider in the past three years.
In general, users of financial services have expressed satisfaction with the services offered by
financial services providers. MFIs or other NBCIs fare less favorably that most other types of financial
institutions, with insurance and MTOs earning the highest praise from consumers (see Figure 30).

There are striking differences in the satisfaction levels between regions with services offered by MFIs
and other NBCIs. Based on data shown in Map 12, the maximum variance in satisfaction levels represents
127 percent of the national average. The region with the lowest satisfaction is Lankaran and the one with the
highest satisfaction is Baku & Absheron where the financial sector is the most developed in the country.

Among those who ever used banks, low income segments and formally employed are less satisfied
with their products than their counterpart groups. As shown in Figure 31, while 80 percent of the highest
income earners who ever used bank products reported to be satisfied with them, only 69 percent of the lowest
income group indicated to be satisfied with the bank products they used. Whereas 75 percent of informally
employed adults indicated that they are satisfied with the products offered by banks, the corresponding
number for formally employed Azerbaijani is 70 percent.

Notable differences can also be observed in satisfaction levels between regions with services
provided by banks. Based on data given in Map 13, the maximum spread in satisfaction levels represents
40 percent of the national average. The regions with the highest levels of satisfaction are the two wealthiest

(Baku & Absheron and Daglig-Shirvan) and the one with the lowest level of satisfaction is the poorest region
(Quba-Khachmaz).

Another important finding is that 12 percent of the surveyed respondents experienced financial
service provider conflicts, the majority of whom did not try to resolve the conflicts they encountered.
As shown in Figure 32, slightly more than one out of ten Azerbaijani adults stated that they experienced a
conflict with a financial service provider in the past three years. This incidence rate of reported financial
service provider conflicts is a medium index used to compare to other countries for which a comparable
indicator is available. For instance, this rate is 25 percent in Morocco, 17 percent in Philippines, 15 percent
in Mozambique, 12 percent in Senegal, 5 percent in Mongolia, and only 1 percent in Tajikistan. On the other
hand, as shown in figure 30, less than twenty percent of those Azerbaijani adults who encountered a dispute
took actions to try to resolve it. Interestingly, twice as many of those who did not experience a conflict (40
percent) stated that if they faced a conflict they would try to resolve it.

There are significant differences between regions in conflicts arising with financial services
providers. Baku & Absheron has the lowest level of disputes, most likely due to a more developed financial
sector in that region. As can be seen in Map 14, the maximum variance between levels of disputes with
financial services providers on a regional basis represents about 106% of the national average. This
underscores the huge gap that exists between the main financial center (Baku) and the other regions of
Azerbaijan. Also at the geographical level, the survey findings suggest that 10 percent of urban dwellers faced
a conflict with a financial provider in the past three years as compared to 15 percent of rural residents.

In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, internal complaints handling systems and legal
courts were barely sought by those who experienced a conflict with their financial service provider.
Figure 33 highlights the approaches followed in trying to resolve the conflict. As can be seen, the most
common actions taken to try to resolve disputes were to submit a claim to the appropriate government
authority (57 percent) and to stop using the services before the contract expired (36 percent). Only around
one out of five reportedly submitted a grievance to the company that sold the product (19 percent), while 7
percent approached legal courts. The latter finding can most likely be explained by perceived high costs and
lengthy time of proceedings.

The main causes for inertia are either related to perceived power imbalances between financial
services providers and their clients or they relate to lack of trust in or lack of awareness of respective
government authorities which can be approached in the event of a dispute. As Figure 34 presents, more
than two thirds of those who did not take any actions to resolve a dispute reported as main reason for their
inertia that they perceived financial institutions as being too powerful. Slightly less, 61 percent indicated that
they think the government authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not aware of
any government agencies they can approach for help. Slightly more than one third of those who did not try to
solve a conflict mentioned that they did not take any actions because they think the law does not adequately
protect consumers. Only 3 percent who did not take any actions to resolve a dispute declared that they are
too shy to redress the dispute.
