                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.      Rice is an important agricultural product and food staple in the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS), especially for its three low-income members – Cambodia, Lao PDR,
and Myanmar. These countries are net exporters of rice, similar to their more advanced
neighbors – Thailand and Vietnam – but their rice sector potential is still largely underutilized.
They adopt slightly different approaches to rice sector development in terms of the role of the
private sector, openness to foreign direct investments (FDI), and commitment to open trade,
yet they all aim to remain competitive on export markets and to leverage this competitiveness
for poverty reduction and boosted shared prosperity, while achieving other development
outcomes such as better nutrition, climate-smart agriculture, and job creation. Cambodia, Lao
PDR, and Myanmar are the “target countries” of this report, while Thailand and Vietnam are
the peers used for comparison and experience-sharing throughout the report.
2.      One way to help these countries achieve their objectives is to allow them to learn
from each other to both replicate positive lessons from the region and globally and avoid
mistakes made by others. Learning from the recent past is an important starting point,
including an assessment of policies and programs that have worked and had large lasting
impacts. This learning builds on earlier individual country rice-related studies conducted by
the Word Bank Group (WBG), other development partners, and academia. Going forward, it
is important to identify policies “fit for purpose” of these countries, i.e., tailored to their net
export trade position and limited fiscal space. This implies learning from negative experiences
with unsustainable, costly programs or unsuitable policies such as farm price supports or buffer
stocks. The dialogue between private and public sectors is intensified to clarify the public
sector’s roles in an era of constrained government budgets and tough competition on regional
and world markets; this calls for targeted delivery of core public goods that would really make
a difference to input suppliers, farmers, millers, and traders (i.e., the private sector) in the target
countries. Rice federations are already actively engaged in this dialogue, especially in
Cambodia and Myanmar, and this dialogue can be extended regionally.
3.      National economies are becoming more interlinked and interdependent, and
cross-border trade plays an increasingly important role in the rice sectors of GMS
countries. Active cross-border trade and technology transfers occur between Cambodia and
Lao PDR and Thailand and Vietnam, and between Myanmar and China. Policies from one
country affect the others; for example, Thailand’s rice pledging scheme affected prices and
trade flows in other GMS countries during 2011-2014, and the reentrance of Myanmar onto
world markets has increased competition with Cambodia on the European Union (EU) market
under the Everything but Arms (EBA) Agreement. These interlinkages are poorly understood
and rarely factored in national strategies and plans.
4.      The WBG, in a strategic partnership with the United Nations’ Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), organized a
series of workshops in 2015 and 2016 to promote cross-country learning and national,
regional, and global experience sharing. These workshops brought together policy makers,
private sector representatives, academia, and development practitioners. They included more
than 50 policy makers from the target countries, representing ministries of agriculture,
commerce, industrial development, and economy and finance; rice millers and exporters; and
academia and think tanks (Myanmar Development Research Institute, Myanmar Yezin
Agricultural University, Center for Agrarian Systems Research and Development of Vietnam,
Kasetsart University of Thailand, Knowledge Network Institute Thailand, and Thailand
Development Research Institute). The WBG was represented by the International Finance
Corporation and several Global Practices of the World Bank (e.g., Agriculture, Poverty, Human


                                                 viii
Development & Nutrition, Trade & Competitiveness, and Rural, Social & Urban
Development), bringing the best practices and knowledge from around the world across the
WBG.
5.   Six workshops were carried out in 2015 and 2016, including three regional ones in
Bangkok and three in-country:1
       a. The March and May 2015 regional workshops in Bangkok, Thailand, gathered rice
          experts from five GMS countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and
          Vietnam) to develop policy-applied indicators of rice value chain development and
          verify the data collected in 2013/2014.
       b. The November 2015 regional workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, gathered policy
          makers, the private sector, academia, and development practitioners for three days to
          discuss: how rice sector development can contribute more to poverty reduction in
          Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar; how it can improve nutrition and gender
          outcomes, as rice value chains in the target countries lag behind compared to Thailand
          and Vietnam; and the outlook for global and regional external factors that will shape
          rice sector competitiveness in the upcoming decade. The workshop also discussed the
          future policy agenda for rice sector development.
       c. The November 2015 workshop in Vientiane, Lao PDR, focused on sharing Cambodian
          experiences with rice value chain development, especially the importance of the
          private sector, the enabling environment required to leverage private investment, and
          the importance of the public sector’s catalytic role, including the partnerships with rice
          federations.
       d. The December 2015 workshop in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, discussed the challenges
          for rice sector development in Cambodia, and evolving competitive pressures from
          Myanmar and Vietnam on global markets.
       e. The January 2016 workshop in Yangon, Myanmar, focused on the competitiveness of
          its rice sector and farm production economics.
6.      This report presents a summary of main findings, lessons learned, and policy
recommendations from these workshops. The spectrum of discussions was broad, depending
on the interest of each country to learn specific experiences from other countries or from the
region and the world. Most workshops brought together private and public sector
representatives to facilitate open dialogue and better integrate private sector objectives into
agricultural strategies and policies.
7.     The major lessons learned from the recent developments are summarized as
follows:
       a. Improved rice sector performance is critical for continued poverty reduction in
          the target countries. The sector is still large and important in land use, farm incomes,
          and food consumption, and can be further leveraged to reduce poverty. Where the rice
          sector has already contributed to poverty reduction, such as recently in Cambodia and
          earlier in Vietnam, it has also boosted shared prosperity.
       b. Rice value chains in the target countries are weaker than those in Thailand and
          Vietnam, and thus require strengthening to help reduce poverty. In Cambodia,
          Lao PDR, and Myanmar, rice value chains are characterized by less efficient input
          supply systems, lower farm productivity and profitability, a more costly milling sector,

    Annexes present the detailed summary of these workshops, lists of participants, and the agenda.


                                                         ix
            higher exporting costs, and lower valued types of exported rice than in Thailand and
            Vietnam.
        c. The target counties can catch up with Thailand and Vietnam, a convergence that
           offers a high rate of return. Cambodia is ahead of Lao PDR and Myanmar in catching
           up with Thailand and Vietnam, triggered by strategic policy decisions in 2010 to
           liberalize trade, remove agricultural distortions, encourage FDI in rice mills, and
           encourage stronger ties between value chain players such as farmers and millers. This
           all helped Cambodia’s rice sector to contribute handsomely to poverty reduction: rice
           sector growth explains an estimated 63 percent of the country’s total poverty reduction
           between 2004 and 2011. The rice sector’s contribution to poverty reduction in Lao
           PDR was also large, 44 percent from 2007 to 2013, but lagged behind that of
           Cambodia.2
        d. Closing the large yield gap between the target countries and their peers can
           render significant gains. Yet closing the labor productivity gap, which is even larger
           than the land productivity gap, would bring even higher rewards. This is because labor
           productivity directly affects farm incomes and contributes to acceleration of structural
           transformation.
        e. Developing rice value chains in GMS countries is closely associated with raising
           their export competitiveness. All GMS countries are net rice exporters, so higher
           productivity and production of rice can only be sustained by exporting larger surpluses,
           as they already produce enough rice for domestic consumption. Compared to
           Cambodia and Myanmar, Lao PDR is still a small irregular exporter to Vietnam, China,
           and the EU with high annual fluctuations of export quantities, but in the future even
           Lao PDR can become a consistent exporter. Gaining a competitive advantage on
           foreign markets depends not only on higher production but also quality, safety, supply
           reliability, marketing, and branding.
        f. The strength of rice value chains is affected by the quantity and quality of private
           investments in input supply, farm technologies, rice mills, and trading/exporting
           activities. The public sector has a large role to play in encouraging private investment
           through programs, policies, and regulations. Cambodia’s decision to open the rice
           milling industry to FDI in 2010, underpinned by its clear rice export policy, is an
           example of a “game changing” policy. From zero in 2008, at least 35 percent of
           Cambodia’s modern milling capacities were recorded in 2015 as joint ventures with
           foreign investors from China, India, and Thailand. This helped increase the national
           rice milling capacity from 95 tons of paddy per hour in 2009 to 854 tons of paddy per
           hour in 2015. In contrast, Myanmar’s partial easing of rules for FDI since 2011,
           especially the restrictions on investing in existing mills, has not encouraged investment
           in its rice value chain.
        g. Policies regulating markets are important. Lao PDR uses quantitative restrictions
           for rice exports from time to time depending on domestic production. Its export
           therefore remains small. Cambodia pursues an open trade policy and permits export of
           both rice and paddy, which helps increase export volumes. Myanmar liberalized trade
           and unified exchange rates in 2012, which led to a doubling of its rice exports between
           2011 and 2014.
8.     Going forward, the target countries are well positioned to strengthen their rice
value chains. This is because new emerging opportunities exist, including beneficial medium-

term projections for global rice demand growth, and high potential for the target counties to
increase cropping intensity and close the large yield gaps with other Asian countries, which is
easier to do by adopting already tested existing technologies than to invent new technologies
that shift up the production possibility frontier. Opportunities also arise from the growing
recognition in all target countries for the need to shift from the paradigm of rice production to
strategies supporting broader objectives such as economic growth, competitiveness, better
nutrition, and environmental sustainability.
9.     Capitalizing on these opportunities will depend on the target countries’ ability to
withstand the emerging challenges. These include declining per capita demand for rice,
strong competition on the global rice market, and the protectionist policies of major rice
importers. Challenges also include rising competition from other crops for land, water, labor,
and capital, their higher profitability, and more demands for the rice sector to contribute more
towards better nutrition and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They are discussed in
turn:
      a. In spite of the higher aggregate global demand for rice over the medium run,
         exporters will face headwinds from several dimensions. Per capita rice
         consumption is projected to decline as consumers shift to other food. Global rice
         prices are also on the decline: they are predicted to be 10 percent lower in 2025 than
         in 2015. Rice prices will remain volatile, adding uncertainty for producers and
         investors, thereby increasing the risk of political interventions aimed at stabilizing
         prices. Price stabilization efforts in net exporting countries have historically
         undermined export competitiveness, so an outlook of high price volatility is not
         encouraging.
      b. Importers will buy more rice but competition among exporters will be fierce.
         Vietnam, for example, recently signed a series of free trade agreements, including
         with the EU, challenging the recent monopoly of Cambodia and Myanmar in
         accessing the EU market through the EBA. In developed countries, consumers
         increasingly demand safer and higher-quality rice, further challenging the target
         countries. Accessing other markets will be difficult as rice remains politicized and all
         major rice importers seek to increase production to reduce imports. They may not be
         successful in reducing import needs, but they will continue to prohibit free imports
         and raise import barriers.
      c. Rice producers face rising competition from other agriculture subsectors. As
         incomes have risen across the world and urbanization increased, diets have
         diversified and substitution has occurred between types of food. Thus, producing and
         selling crops other than rice will offer higher growth opportunities. In addition, other
         crops are often more profitable, especially during the dry season, so switching from
         dry season rice to beans and pulses, for example, may bring higher profits. Also
         important, many crops are less costly and water-intensive to produce, all important
         factors in the credit- and water-constrained context of GMS countries.
      d. The target countries are confronted with high malnutrition rates, especially
         child stunting, to which (still) low paddy profitability and (still) high rice
         consumption may contribute. The increase in profitability of paddy production will
         bring more income to paddy growers, helping them to address some of the nutrition
         challenges. But making rice value chains more nutrition-sensitive through rice
         fortification and increasing awareness about the higher nutritional value of less
         polished and milled rice will be challenging and overcome only with large efforts.



                                               xi
         e. The rice sector contributes heavily to climate change. Paddy cultivation is the
            second largest emitter of GHGs in agriculture, with 90 percent of emissions
            originating in Asia. Agriculture is expected to contribute to mitigation efforts to save
            the planet, including Asia’s rice sector. Cutting emissions from rice production and
            the associated use of fertilizers requires higher spending on programs that improve
            water, soil nutrients, and residue management and more capacitated extension
            services to help farmers adopt climate-smart technologies and diversification to other
            crops, a challenge in low-income countries.
10.     Taken together, these challenges are to be seen as an opportunity to conduct
reforms and gain an edge in rice competitiveness, efficiency, and resilience. Rice will
remain an important crop in the GMS countries, and a significant diversification away from
rice will be more successful on the back of superior paddy cultivation performance than as an
alternative to struggling paddy cultivation. A farmer who is struggling with paddy productivity
or quality is likely to have problems handling other crops, which require more specialized
knowledge, more attentive care or good access to urban markets.
11.     The target countries have many policy instruments to improve the performance
of their rice value chains that would help them capitalize on opportunities and overcome
challenges. Some of these instruments are presented in Table ES1. They arose from numerous
discussions at the workshops and build on earlier individual country rice-related studies.3 These
instruments have a varying degree of urgency and significance in the target countries, ranging
from low (*) to very high (***). And many of them offer a high potential for public-private
partnership (PPP) to achieve the best results. Shifting from production and export targets to
supporting rice value chain actors’ income is a new policy paradigm to be adopted by the target
countries to continue to leverage their rice sector for sustained poverty reduction.

                        CHAPTER 1: SETTING UP THE CONTEXT
1.      Rice is the main agricultural product and food staple in Asia. Its importance is
comparable to that of wheat in Europe and the Middle East or maize in East and Southern
Africa. Rice in Asia plays important economic, cultural, and political roles, and in some
countries it still has a significant leveraging role in the economy as it accounts for high shares
of gross domestic product (GDP) and labor force. In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),4
these countries include Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, which belong to a group of low-
income countries with low paddy yields and low cropping intensity but high agricultural
potential. The rice sector dominates agriculture and food in these countries even more than in
neighboring Thailand and Vietnam (Table 1), and its further development offers many benefits
in the short to medium run, including a reduction in extreme poverty, boosted shared prosperity,
lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, job creation, especially in the rice processing and
trade industries, and improved nutrition.

2.     Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar have much in common regarding their
potential to use the rice sector in poverty reduction. This allows for a regional approach and
cross-country knowledge-sharing for the “target countries” of this report. What are these
common features?
3.     First, all three are net rice exporters.5 Unlike island countries (Indonesia, Malaysia,
and the Philippines) or countries with limited land and water (China), but similar to Thailand
and Vietnam, they have strong natural advantages (i.e., sufficient land and water, with main
rice production bowls located in the deltas of the Mekong and Ayeyarwaddy Rivers) to
generate rice surpluses (Figure 1). Such environments are particularly suitable for cultivating
rice, which, unlike wheat and maize, has a semi-aquatic ancestry and is thus particularly

  The Greater Mekong Subregion is a country grouping introduced by the Asian Development Bank. It includes
China, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. When referring to GMS herein, China is
excluded due to its unique large size, net importer trade status, and its different history of development
compared to that of other GMS countries.
5
  Lao PDR is still a small exporter, but with the potential to become a larger and more consistent exporter.


                                                       2
sensitive to water shortages. The river systems also allow for lower-cost transportation of rice
over medium and long distances, thereby facilitating exports (Dawe 2013).

4.      Rice exports in turn can be leveraged for economic development. Larger exports is
one of the best available options for the target countries to convert the anticipated higher
productivity and production of rice into higher farm income, because all three countries already
produce more than enough rice for domestic consumption (Table 2). Another option is improve
rice quality and penetrate into higher quality and niche markets. The export volumes of the
target countries are relatively low now compared to those of Thailand and Vietnam, but relative
to production the ratio is not far away. In 2014/15, Cambodia’s share of export to production
was 23 percent versus 22 percent in Vietnam and 48 percent in Thailand. Myanmar’s share was
16 percent, while Lao PDR’s was close to zero. More than half of the target countries’ rice
exports go across the border informally, another common feature.

5.      Second, they are poorer than Thailand and Vietnam (Table 3) and many people
in these countries depend on agriculture. These three countries are actually the last so-called
“agriculture-based” economies in East Asia, with large shares of agriculture in national
accounts (GDP and labor force).7 Figure 2Figure 2 shows that by 2012, all other East Asian
countries had left the “agriculture-based” phase of development, transitioning further left,
closer to “urbanized” Korea and Japan. The good news for the target countries is that the 2008
World Development Report found that in “agriculture-based” economies, growth originated in
agriculture is four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth originating in any
other sector (WDR 2007). Since rice production dominates the agriculture sector in Cambodia,
Lao PDR, and Myanmar, rice sector improvements offer tremendous economic benefits, while
a failure to launch the rice sector will handicap overall agricultural growth.

6.     Third, the target countries have good rice sector and overall agricultural potential.
Paddy yields, both average and those of better farms, in these countries lag behind yields in
Thailand and especially Vietnam (Table 4). Their cropping intensity is also much smaller,
along with yields resulting in much lower agricultural value added per hectare. Yet these
countries have sufficient arable land and suitable agro-ecology to catch up with their more
advanced neighbors.

 The 2008 World Development Report divided all countries into five groups depending on the share of their
agriculture sector in GDP and labor force. Countries with a large share were included in an “agriculture -based”
group and countries with a small share in an “urbanized” group.

7.     Fourth, some of the target countries already have a proven record for using the
rice sector in poverty reduction. Cambodia stands out as a good example: 63 percent of
poverty reduction during 2004-2011 was driven by positive developments in the rice sector
(World Bank 2013b). Cambodia has repeated the earlier performance of Vietnam, whose
increased paddy productivity in the 1990s and consequent growth in rice exports helped reduce
poverty, from 34.8 percent in 1998 to 16.2 percent in 2008, measured at $1.25 a day in 2005
purchasing power parity (PPP) (Minot and Goletti 2000; World Bank 2012c).

8.      At the same time, Lao PDR and Myanmar’s rice sectors have been
underperforming, putting a dent in poverty reduction efforts there. In Lao PDR, the
poverty headcount (measured at $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP) fell only by 17 percent, from 36.3
percent in 2007 to 30.0 percent in 2012, in spite of high per capita GDP growth (Table 5). In
comparison, the poverty headcount in Cambodia declined by 79 percent during the same period
at lower per capita GDP growth. The difference is in the contribution of agriculture and
particularly the rice sector to overall GDP: in Cambodia, average growth in agricultural GDP
during 2007-2012 was 4.6 percent while in Lao PDR it was 3.3 percent (WDI 2015). In
Myanmar, for which poverty estimates in 2005 PPP are not yet available, the poverty headcount
at the national poverty line declined by 29 percent between 2009/10 and 2015 (Table 5). At an



                                             5
annual per capita GDP growth at 6.3 percent, the growth elasticity of poverty was only 0.9,
similar to the situation in Lao PDR.

9.      Many questions arise, including the following. What were the drivers of rice sector
growth in Cambodia and how did this growth translate into lower poverty? Why was the
growth-poverty link weaker in Lao PDR and Myanmar? What are the future drivers of rice
sector growth in the target countries? Are their rice value chains prepared to capitalize on the
emerging opportunities and respond to challenges? How can the rice sector adjust to the higher
profitability of other crops? How can the rice sector be better leveraged for better nutrition and
lower carbon emissions? And what should be the role of government vis-à-vis the private sector
going forward?
10.    These questions are critical for all three target countries. The report provides
answers to these questions, organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents an overview of recent
experiences in leveraging rice for poverty reduction in the GMS. Chapter 3 discusses
opportunities and challenges going forward. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis of rice
value chains, including an analysis of their preparedness to use the rice sector for poverty
reduction and achievement of other social and economic development objectives such as
climate change mitigation, improved nutrition, and job creation. Chapter 5 presents policy
recommendations.

    CHAPTER 2: RICE SECTOR AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE
               MEKONG: RECENT EXPERIENCES
11.    As mentioned above, Cambodia is a good example of how positive rice sector
developments can drive poverty reduction. The poverty headcount measured at the national
poverty line declined from 50.2 percent in 2004 to 17.7 percent in 2012, or by 65 percent.
Measured at $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP, the decline in the poverty headcount was even larger (81
percent), from 32.0 percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2012 (Figure 3). The number of poor
people fell from 4.9 million in 2004 to 0.6 million in 2012 (Figure 4).

12.    The World Bank estimated that 63 percent of Cambodia’s poverty reduction was
linked to the rice sector (Figure 5). How did it happen?

        a. Higher rice prices (24 percent): The significant increase in global rice prices in 2008
           led to higher prices in Cambodia (Figure 6). With its commitment to an open trade
           policy, the government permitted the transmission of higher global prices into local
           markets. In Cambodia, the number of net buyers of rice is higher than the number
           of net sellers (Table 6) but poverty is higher among net sellers so higher rice prices
           in general increase incomes of the poor in the short run (World Bank 2013b).

        b. Higher rice production (23 percent): Higher rice prices, improved access to better
           seeds and other inputs, improved irrigation, an open trade policy, and an inflow of
           FDI in the rice milling sector were among the key factors that triggered the 9.4
           percent annual increase of paddy production during 2004-2011 (World Bank and
           AusAid 2015). Paddy producers could sell more of more expensive paddy, thereby
           increasing their incomes. It should be noted, however, that more than 60 percent of
           the production increase was due to land expansion, especially in the dry season, not
           productivity increases.
        c. Higher agricultural wages (16 percent): Higher production of paddy and other
           agricultural products resulted in increased farm wages.8 From 2005 to 2013, average
           farm wages increased by an estimated 265 percent (World Bank and AusAid 2015).

 The growth in farm wages was also a result of other factors, such as higher wages in the garment and
construction sectors.


                                                      8
13.    The positive impact of higher agricultural prices on poverty reduction in
Cambodia was confirmed by a global study carried out by the World Bank (Ivanich and
Martin 2014). The study used household models based on detailed expenditure and agricultural
production data from 31 developing countries, including Cambodia, to assess the impacts of
changes in global food prices on poverty. Higher agricultural prices were found to have
beneficial poverty effects in Cambodia. Table 7 presents poverty impacts for 10 and 50
percentage point increases in global agricultural prices, predicting poverty to reduce by 4.8-
15.8 percent in Cambodia when higher agricultural prices are fully transmitted into higher
consumption (short-run effect), higher wages (medium-run effect), and higher production
(long-run effect).

14.    Higher paddy production in Cambodia led to large surpluses that were exported
as domestic consumption was fully satisfied. In 2004, rice production was still below
consumption, according to the USDA. In 2011, production exceeded consumption by 70
percent (Table 8). Rice was thus exported outside of the region, mainly to the European Union
(EU), and across the border with Thailand and especially Vietnam, mainly in the form of
unmilled paddy.

15.    Cambodia successfully penetrated the EU market, using a zero tariff access to the
EU granted under the EBA. Most of its formal FOB (free on board) exports go to EU
countries9 and Cambodia accounts for half of the total EU imports under the EBA Agreement.
It mainly sells fragrant varieties, which are of higher value and demand. In comparison,

 Main destinations in 2014 were France (27.5 percent of total import), Poland (22.0 percent), Netherlands (12.6
percent), Belgium (7.3 percent), Czech Republic (5.2 percent), the United Kingdom (4.6 percent), Spain (4.6
percent), and Germany (4.5 percent).


                                                       9
Myanmar sells a low-quality broken rice, with an FOB price of $340/ton while Cambodian
fragrant rice was priced at $850/ton in 2014/15 (see Table 45 in Chapter 5).
16.    The rice sector played a major role in poverty reduction in Lao PDR, where
poverty has also fallen, but its impact was smaller than in Cambodia. The poverty
headcount rate at both the national and international poverty lines decreased by 30 percent
(Figure 7) compared to the 60-70 percent reduction in Cambodia. The number of poor declined
by 21 percent, from 2.4 million in 2002 to 1.9 million in 2012 (Figure 8), versus 59 percent in
Cambodia.
17.     The agriculture sector contributed an estimated 43.7 percent to poverty reduction
in Lao PDR during 2007-2013 (World Bank 2015b). In Lao PDR, agriculture is strongly
associated with rice production. Out of 783,000 farm households, 775,000 produce paddy
(MAF 2015). In 2010/11, 75 percent of total arable land was sown with paddy. Why was the
rice sector’s contribution to poverty reduction smaller in Lao PDR than in Cambodia?

                  2002-2012                                  Lao PDR, 2002-2012

18.    The first reason was a smaller increase in paddy production. During 2004-2012,
paddy production in Lao PDR increased annually by 3.7 percent, a much lower rate than in
Cambodia (Table 9). Most of this production growth came from expansion of harvested area.
Land productivity growth was dismal – annual paddy yield grew by 0.8 percent. The resulting
increase in production created a very small rice surplus, with production exceeding
consumption by only 5-10 percent.

19.     The second reason was the negative rice price effect. Poverty in Lao PDR is higher
among net sellers of rice, the same as in Cambodia. About 53 percent of the poor households
in Lao PDR are net sellers of rice compared to 40 percent of the poor being net buyers (Table
10). Furthermore, most net buyers of rice are seasonal, with only 6 percent of poor Laotians
buying rice year round. So when rice prices increase, poverty is expected to decline. Rice prices
in Lao PDR, however, remained unchanged or even dropped during 2007-2012, at least at the
village level (Figure 9). In this regard, it should be noted that most rice produced and consumed
in Lao PDR is glutinous, and the glutinous rice market functions quite independently of the
white rice market. Thus, it is not necessarily surprising that rice prices moved differently in
Lao PDR and Cambodia. In any event, due to the price decline, Lao PDR’s production response
was small compared to that of Cambodia.

20.      The third reason was Lao PDR’s weak export performance. Official statistics report
zero or very small rice exports. Most rice produced in Lao PDR is consumed domestically
(Table 11). Cross-border trade with Vietnam is estimated at 100,000-200,000 tons per year, but
this trade is hampered by the export quota (70,000 tons) and recurrent, often informal, bans on
paddy export. Trade is subject to restrictions because the authorities are concerned about a
small rice surplus generated by Lao farmers and the thinness of glutinous rice market (i.e.,
Thailand and Vietnam are the only other producers of glutinous rice). Once rice production


                                                                      11
increases, however, proactive trade promotion would be necessary to achieve long-run poverty
impacts from higher rice production.

21.     In Myanmar, the link between rice sector development and poverty reduction is
more difficult to establish due to the lack of accurate historical data. Yet some preliminary
analysis can be made. According to preliminary World Bank estimates, the poverty headcount
decreased from 37.5 percent in 2009/10 to 26.5 percent in 2015 using the methodology
established in World Bank 2014c. Some of this poverty reduction might have been due to the
recent increase in paddy production. During 2010/11 and 2014/15, paddy production increased
by 3.3 percent annually, entirely due to the rising yields, using the data from USDA.
Performance during this recent period contrasts with performance between 2004 and 2012,
during which annual paddy production rose by only 1.4 percent (Table 9). Since the largest
number of poor in Myanmar live in the Delta and Dry Zone, the country’s main paddy
production areas (Table 12), the increase in paddy production and productivity is likely to have
contributed to lower poverty rates in Myanmar (World Bank 2014c).

22.     The improved export performance might have also added a positive impetus to
poverty reduction. Exports rose from 190,000 tons in 2004 to 1,750,000 tons in 2014 (Table
13), although the overall surplus (defined as production less domestic consumption) remains
small. In 2014, the ratio of rice surplus to production in Myanmar was just 15 percent,
compared to 30 percent in Cambodia and Vietnam and 50 percent in Thailand. In 2012/13,
export was equally divided between FOB export through Yangon Port and cross-border sales
to China (LIFT and World Bank 2014). In 2014/15, about 75 percent of rice export went to
China through cross-border trade, with the larger FOB export to the EU not able to fully
compensate for the loss in exports to Africa (Table 14).

23.     As in Cambodia and Lao PDR, most paddy producers in Myanmar are net sellers
of rice. A survey of about 1,730 farms carried out in four regions of Myanmar during the 2013
monsoon season and 2014 dry season found that their paddy production exceeded own farm
consumption. Per capita annual consumption of milled rice ranged from 112 kg in Sagaing
region to 152 kg in Bago region, while per capita production of paddy was 361 kg in Sagaing
region, 1,078 kg in Bago region, and 1,238 kg in Ayeyarwady region.10 Even small farms, those
with farmland area less than 1 ha, were consistently found to be net sellers (Table 15). This
implies that they benefited from the larger rice export. Export is not the only factor determining
rice prices in Myanmar, but if exports had been lower, paddy prices would have been lower
too.
24.     Not known in Myanmar, however, is the relative poverty rate of net sellers vis-à-
vis net buyers. In both Cambodia and Lao PDR, net sellers of rice are poorer than net buyers,
so higher paddy prices or lower costs between farm-gate and markets leading to higher profits
from selling paddy reduce poverty. This may not hold in Myanmar. Poverty in Myanmar is
highest among landless and small farmers, who are net buyers of rice. More unequal land
distribution in Myanmar than seen in other target countries hints at less clear short-run positive
effects of higher rice prices on poverty, even if small farms are net rice sellers, although most
rural landless are wage workers so in the medium run they can also benefit from higher wages
triggered by higher prices and production.




 On average, it takes 1 kg of “paddy” to produce 0.6 kg of “rice” in Myanmar. In other words, the average
10

milling ratio is 60 percent.

25.     In summary, history reveals that the rice sector can be leveraged for poverty
reduction. Cambodia is a clear example of how this can be done, especially when rice prices
are high. All three target countries lag behind Thailand and Vietnam in many respects, from
yields and cropping intensity to export volumes and agricultural income. Thus they can still
count on the rice sector to reduce poverty in the near future. Whether their potential is actually
realized depends on many factors, especially the quality of agricultural policies and public
programs aimed at capitalizing on the evolving opportunities and addressing challenges. These
opportunities and challenges are discussed in Chapter 3.

     CHAPTER 3: EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

Opportunities

26.     A number of short- to medium-run opportunities exist for the rice sector in the
target countries. If capitalized on, the rice sector will certainly contribute to poverty reduction.
These opportunities include closure of the large paddy yield gap, the high potential to increase
cropping intensity in a sustainable manner, and rising global demand for rice. The target
countries have also started to shift from rice production-centric strategies to strategies aimed
at achievement of broader objectives such as promotion of export and value chains. They can
build on this shift to move further to a new policy framework for supporting the rice sector.

   (i)     Closing paddy yield gaps

27.     In spite of recent improvements, average paddy yields are still very low in all three
target countries. Their paddy yields average less than 3 tons/ha, while yields in other countries
are much higher, both on average and in the main rice bowls (Figure 10). There is no reason
why the target countries cannot close the yield gap, at least with Thailand and Vietnam,
countries with similar agro-ecology and sometimes even less favorable (smaller) farm sizes
(e.g., Vietnam). Closing the paddy yield gap offers high rates of return for the target countries.

       Source: FAS-USDA 2015 for the country average yields; Bordey et al. 2015 for the main
    producing area yields in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam; World Bank
         estimates for the main producing area yields in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar.

   (ii)    Increasing cropping intensity

28.    Most paddy in the target countries is produced during the wet (or monsoon)
season. In 2013/14, the share of paddy produced during the dry season in total production
ranged from 13 percent in Lao PDR to 23 percent in Cambodia (Table 16). In Thailand and
Vietnam, this share was close to a half of total production.


                                                15
29.     The difference is a result of much lower cropping intensity in the target countries.
Cropping intensity is defined as paddy area cultivated in the dry season divided by paddy area
cultivated in the wet season, multiplied by 100. It is lower in the target countries due to their
lower irrigation coverage (Table 16). Although much depends on agro-ecological conditions
and water availability, there is no reason to suggest that the target countries cannot catch up
with Thailand and Vietnam in irrigation coverage and cropping intensity. This offers a
tremendous opportunity.

30.     Intensification of rice production is to be done in an economically, socially, and
environmentally sustainable manner. The policy to maximize rice production in Vietnam,
for example, encourages farmers to produce two or even three crops in a year, yet during the
summer-autumn season farmers often incur losses. In addition, its high environmental footprint
impacts Vietnam rice’s image on global markets. Having a “green” image is increasingly
important to penetrate into more lucrative niche markets, for example through the new
sustainable rice production standards (Box 1). This is especially important for Cambodia and
Lao PDR, which are unlikely to be able to compete with Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam on
export volumes. Over-intensification can reduce quality and sustainability of rice cultivation,
and therefore requires a careful strategy.

                               Box 1: Sustainable Rice Platform

        In October 2015, Mars Food Corporation, the owner of the world’s largest rice brand,
        Uncle Ben’s, announced its commitment to sustainably source 100 percent of its rice
        by 2020 using the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) standard. What is SRP? The SRP
        was launched in 2011 to promote adoption of sustainable climate-smart best practices
        while protecting the environment by boosting the use efficiency of resources such as
        water and agrochemicals. The SRP has 30 institutional members, including the
        United Nations Environment Programme, the International Rice Research Institute,
        government agencies, private sector actors, research institutions, and non-profit
        organizations.
        The SRP standard consists of a set of 46 requirements for sustainable rice cultivation
        organized under 8 broad topics, including productivity, food safety, worker health,
        labor rights, and biodiversity. The validation of standards on farm fields is planned
        in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and
        Uganda. The findings of the validation program will be used to revise standards and
        performance indicators if necessary.

31.    Paying attention to the management of environmental risks is not only good for
long-term profitability and export competitiveness but also for human health and
nutrition. The policy-induced unsustainable rice intensification in Vietnam offers good
lessons for the target GMS countries. Three rice crop areas of Vietnam’s Mekong Delta are
now virtually dead zones. The overuse of chemicals and fertilizer run-off caused poisoning of
paddies as well as of massive numbers of fish in the rivers (World Bank 2016a). Paddy fields
that were formerly a source of animal protein (snails, frogs, fish, etc.) now just yield
carbohydrates from rice. This unsustainable intensification also affected malnutrition, which
remains high in many areas of the Mekong Delta despite the rising rice production.

   (iii)   Rising global demand for rice

32.     Global forecasts anticipate increased aggregated demand for rice, particularly in
Asia and Africa, where population growth is fastest. The International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI) projects that 116 million tons of additional rice over 2010 levels will be needed
by 2035 (IFC 2015). FAO and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) estimate global rice consumption to increase annually by 1.5 percent between 2015
and 2024 (OECD-FAO 2015). In East Asia alone, demand for rice is projected to increase from
82 million tons in 2009 to 97 million tons in 2030 (Jamora 2014). According to the USDA,
more rice will also be demanded in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa (Table 17) and the
demand growth for higher quality, specialty rice will exceed the demand growth for lower
quality commodity rice (Table 23). This presents a significant opportunity for the target
countries, which have a long tradition of producing rice, a large network of rice millers and
traders, and various rice brands meeting the requirements of both less and more affluent
consumers.

33.     Cross-border trade is anticipated to continue to provide a market opportunity for
the target countries. Vietnam is anticipated to continue buying paddy and rice from
Cambodia, as Cambodian paddy is considered to be of higher quality than that produced in
Vietnam. Well-established cross-country rice trade linkages further ease cross-border trade
(Sok 2015). Vietnam will also continue to offer market opportunities for Lao PDR. Vietnam is
projected to increase its consumption of glutinous rice and Lao rice is considered to be of higher


                                               17
quality than the high-quality glutinous rice produced in Vietnam and much cheaper than
glutinous rice imported from Thailand (Figure 11). China offers new market opportunities for
Lao PDR as well since signing a rice trade agreement with China in 2015.

34.     China is likely to continue to be the main market outlet for Myanmar. In recent
years, rising demand for Myanmar rice in China was driven by the large price wedge between
these two countries caused by China’s farm price support program, introduced in 2010 (LIFT
and World Bank 2014). Since then, rice prices in China have been twice as high as prices on
the world market (Vietnam) and in Myanmar (Figure 12). No indications suggest that Chinese
authorities will remove this price support program in the near future as the income gap between
rural and urban areas continues to grow there. Demand from China will remain strong. The rice
trade agreement signed with China in 2015 offers an additional entry point to complement
informal cross-border trade with formal FOB trade in the near future. Eventually, higher
exports are the only way to absorb the higher production necessary to generate economic
growth and reduce poverty in all three target countries.

   (iv)    Positive shifts in rice sector strategies

35.     Recent changes in the paradigm of rice sector development can be used to
capitalize on the emerging opportunities. Production has long been the focus of government
strategies and investment plans in the target countries, and higher paddy production until very
recently was considered as a mission accomplished. Yet with rice surpluses rising, along with
(gradually) rising productivity, attention is now being paid to other issues. Export promotion
is a new recent priority in the region.
36.     Cambodia is a good example of this shift. As alluded to in Chapter 2, the Cambodian
Council of Ministers adopted “The Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export Policy” in
July 2010. The policy: recognized the importance of rising rice productivity, as the country’s
farmland frontier is essentially closed; set a target of 1 million tons of rice export by 2015; and
emphasized rice quality improvements and diversification. The government put in place a
number of reforms that opened and liberalized trade and FDI and reduced barriers for the
private sector. Export licenses became available to all traders and rice mills requesting them,
expanding the number of rice exporters from 5 to 86. It also established a “one window service”
for exports and has continuously reduced export costs.
37.     These reforms helped increase export volumes and value. In 2015 the Cambodian
FOB rice export reached more than 500,000 tons, compared to 12,000 tons in 2009 and 380,000
tons in 2013 (Table 8). Most FOB rice has been a higher-value fragrant rice. About 1,500,000
tons are also exported to Vietnam and Thailand through cross-border routes, mainly paddy.
The authorities resisted the temptation to forbid paddy export and redirect it to milling within
the country, recognizing that farmers benefit from allowing paddy exports and that competition
in the milling sector is important for the strength and sustainability of the overall rice economy.
38.     Myanmar also recognizes the importance of export promotion. Its Ministry of
Commerce prepared “The National Export Strategy of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar
for 2015-2019” in April 2015, with rice among the priority products for export promotion.
Launched by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) in May 2015, the “Myanmar
Rice Sector Development Strategy” puts emphasis on rice value chain development and export
competitiveness. In 2015, the government also signed a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)
agreement with China, the implementation of which, in partnership with the Myanmar Rice
Federation (MRF), would allow adding FOB rice export to cross-border export through Muse
in Shan State. These strategies and agreements were influenced by the increased recognition
that export is the key to absorbing the rising paddy surpluses and that the larger volume of rice
exports, which grew from 190,000 tons in 2004 to 1,800,000 tons in 2014 (Table 13), do not
automatically translate into much higher profits for rice value chain actors, necessitating more
strategic support to unleash the rice sector’s full potential.
39.     Lao PDR is now paying more attention to markets and exports. Production targets
will remain important in the country in the foreseeable future, which is understandable, as its
rice production is not far above domestic consumption requirements and the international
glutinous rice market is extremely small and thin (Table 11). In case of any production shock
caused by El Niño, for example, and the need to import, Thailand and Vietnam would be the
only possible suppliers of glutinous rice. Also, a production shock in Lao PDR will mostly
likely affect production in Thailand and Vietnam. Yet the government aims to increase rice
production; as emphasized in the “National Food Security Program for 2016-2020” adopted in
July 2015, achievement of this objective requires strengthening of rice value chains, including
export promotion. In January 2015, the government signed an SPS agreement with China, like
Cambodia and Myanmar, to gain access to the largest Asian market and the largest rice importer


                                                19
since 2012. Increasing production of glutinous rice is also recognized to require better-quality
inputs, stronger rice mills, development of a Lao rice brand, and more coordinated actions of
all actors, via establishment of a rice federation similar to Cambodia and Myanmar Rice
Federations.
40.     The shift in these countries’ rice strategies is supported by regional initiatives and
development partners. The FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific adopted “A
Regional Rice Strategy for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific” in May 2014,
which supports countries’ efforts to align their strategies to the emerging thinking on the
requirements for economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable rice sector
development. IRRI is active in helping with strengthening of national research systems but also
with strategic thinking about broad sector development. For example, it was instrumental in
the preparation of the “Myanmar Rice Sector Development Strategy” mentioned above. The
WBG actively helps governments and the private sector in all three target countries to
strengthen rice value chains through global knowledge generation and dissemination, capacity
building and training, investments in public programs, improved regulations and policies, and
improved access to finance by the private sector. As discussed in Chapter 5, further
improvement in national rice strategies is still necessary in most target countries to capitalize
on emerging opportunities, but the recent positive strategic shifts and the continued availability
of donor support form a strong foundation for these improvements to take place.

Challenges

41.     In addition to opportunities, challenges emerging over the medium run are to be
addressed to build strong rice value chains in the target countries. The challenges can be
roughly divided into four groups. The first is strong competition on global rice markets, along
with declining and volatile prices and stricter requirements for rice safety, quality, and branding
that the target countries must meet. The second is rising competition for land, water, labor, and
capital from other crops, which are often more profitable than paddy and face higher consumer
demand. The third is concern over nutrition or that the rice sector does little to address
malnutrition. The fourth is GHG emissions, to which rice production significantly contributes.
These challenges can be seen as opportunities to trigger changes that would make rice value
chains more competitive, profitable, and nutrition- and climate change-sensitive. Each is
discussed in turn.

   (i)     Rice market outlook

42.     Total global rice consumption is projected to increase over the medium run as
discussed above, yet this increase will be smaller than in the past. This is due to projected
declining per capita rice consumption, as food diets will continue to diversify away from
cereals, driven by economic growth, rising incomes, and urbanization. FAO anticipates global
per capita rice consumption to decline from 56.3 kg per year in 2009-2011 to 55 kg per year in
2030 (FAO 2006). Timmer et al. (2010) estimate per capita consumption to drop to 52.4 kg per
year by 2030. Even in East Asia, the largest consumer of rice, daily caloric intake from rice is
projected to drop from 889 calories in 2009 to 850 in 2030, or 4 percent annually (World Bank
2015c). Export competitors such as India, Thailand, and Vietnam will also want to capture a
larger piece of the global rice market.
43.    Global rice prices are projected to decline, especially compared to the 2008-2009
period. In 2008, global rice prices spiked to $650/ton, from the $250-300/ton that prevailed


                                                20
during 2005-2007. Prices dropped from their 2008 peak in subsequent years; the average price
in 2015 was $385/ton. Going forward, global rice prices are projected to increase to $410/ton
in 2025 in nominal terms, but in 2025 they will be lower in real terms than in 2015, and much
lower than in 2008-2009 (Table 18). Differences arise for various types of rice but the general
tendency for all types of rice is declining real prices.

                  Table 18: Global rice price ($/ton) projections, 2015-2025

                                            2008-2009         2015           2020           2025

44.     Cambodia is a good example of what lower prices over the long period can do to
production. During 2009-2012, when rice prices were relatively high, annual paddy
production growth averaged 6.7 percent (Table 19). The recent decline in global commodity
prices led prices to decline in Cambodia: they were 7 percent less in 2013-2014 compared to
2009-2012. The growth in paddy production slowed down to 1.1 percent in 2013/14 and
contracted by 0.7 percent in 2014/15. In 2015, paddy production was projected to grow by 1
percent.

45.     In addition to being lower, global rice prices will remain volatile, creating
uncertainty for all rice value chain actors and raising political concerns. Volatility of
global rice prices is mainly caused by the rice self-sufficiency policies of net importing
countries such as China and the Philippines. Their national price stabilization policies
destabilize prices in net exporting countries, so the average price volatility of exporters is often
twice as high as that of importers (Table 20).
46.     The challenge for GMS countries is that they have a limited set of instruments to
stabilize prices in the short run without undermining their export competitiveness (World
Bank 2014d; World Bank 2012a). Prices are most easily stabilized through public stocks,
import protection, or minimum farm prices, but these three instruments tend to elevate domestic
prices so are not suitable for net exporters. On the other hand, the political pressure to “do
something” to reduce price volatility at times of price spikes will continue to create risks that
GMS countries intervene through stocks or export bans/quotas. Addressing the long-term
drivers of price volatility (such as the failure of irrigation systems to ensure paddy production
is spread more evenly over the year, low diversification of rice sale channels, high marketing
costs, low private stocks, uncertainty over commitment to open trade, and lack of accurate and
timely market information) calls to take priority over short-term fixes that weaken the rice
sector’s contribution to poverty reduction.

47.     Thailand’s experience illustrates the damage caused by use of an unsuitable policy
instrument such as minimum farm prices. During 2011-2014, Thai authorities used a rice
pledging scheme to support farm incomes through minimum farm prices. The program did
indeed increase prices for Thai farmers (Table 21) but this was short-lived. The program
increased prices in Thailand above prices offered by other exporters, essentially preventing
Thailand from exporting rice (Nipon 2014). Exports dropped, and the rice ending stocks
increased from 6.1 million tons (or 60 percent of domestic use) in 2009/10 to 14.4 million tons
(or 134 percent of domestic use) in 2013/14 (FAS-USDA 2015). The subsidy cost the
government $12.7 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in its first year of operation, raising the
country's fiscal deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2012 from 1.7 percent in 2011. The scheme
cost the government another $13.9 billion, or 3.6 percent of GDP, in 2013 (World Bank 2014d).

48.     Thailand incurred many other indirect but similarly significant costs. Thailand’s
reputation of exporting high-quality rice for which a premium is paid was undermined by
farmers switching to varieties with the shortest growing seasons and highest yields, varieties
that have inferior palatability. Long-term storage of milled rice led to deterioration of its
quality. The already overbuilt rice milling industry expanded, leading to the closure of mills
not enrolled in the program. Farmers’ costs of production increased, reflecting a doubling of
land rents and increased use of and a 20 percent increase in the prices of fertilizer and
pesticides. The higher land rents were a direct consequence of the pledging policy. And, unable
to supply their customer base of over 10 million tons with Thai rice, Thai exporters started to
trade third country rice on a large scale and invest in rice mills in competitor countries,


                                                  22
particularly Cambodia. Both actions directly enhanced the long-term competitiveness of other
countries.
49.     Returning to other challenges, most increase in rice demand will come from the
Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa (Table 17). Penetrating these markets will be difficult,
however, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, as they pursue a food self-sufficiency policy. Many
rice importers such as Nigeria, Senegal, and Tanzania have significantly increased investment
in domestic rice production, including in rice research and development, and raised import
barriers, so only a portion of the higher demand for rice from African consumers will be
available to Asian exporters.
50.     Demand for imported rice from traditional Asian importers (e.g., China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) will remain high but these countries will
continue to use high import tariffs and government monopolies over import of rice.
Liberalization of rice trade in these countries is expected to continue to lag behind liberalization
of other sectors under the ASEAN. Rice importers heavily subsidize rice production, aiming to
fully cover domestic consumption with local production. Although full self-sufficiency will be
hard to achieve for most of them (Dawe 2013), these countries will continue to restrict the free
flow of imports, preferring government-to-government contracts and ad hoc, hard-to-predict
tenders. Participation in this kind of trade arrangement requires good organization in the rice
industry and large export volumes, both of which are still missing in the target countries.
51.     The EU will remain an important destination for the target countries but they will
have to increasingly compete with others. Trade under EBA is not the only source of rice
imports in the EU. In 2014/15, rice imports under EBA accounted for only 29 percent (Figure
13) of all rice imported. The target countries will face increased competition, especially from
Vietnam, who signed a free trade agreement with the EU in 2015.

52.      Vietnam’s exporters have made steady progress in growing their global market
share (IFC 2015). As shown in Table 22, no longer is Vietnam the exporter of only low-quality
rice, as when it captured the rice world’s attention beginning in 1988. During 2010-2012, for
example, Vietnam’s high-quality rice exports averaged 2.85 million tons, or 40 percent of the
country’s total exports. This includes soaring volumes of fragrant rice. Combined exports of
fragrant rice and fragrant broken rice are likely to hit 700,000 tons in 2013, nearly three times
the volume shipped in 2010 and close to five times that exported in 2008.11

53.     An important recent feature of the world rice market is the increasing share of
higher-quality rice demanded by consumers. The largest growth since the mid-1990s has
been in higher qualities – imports of aromatic, high-quality white, and parboiled rice have
roughly tripled and in 2010-2012 represented over half of world trade (Table 23). The volume
of these categories was in excess of 22 million tons or roughly double its volume in the mid-
1990s. Trade is also growing for glutinous rice produced by Lao PDR. Low-grade white
(Indica) rice represents a declining share of the world rice trade, as lower prices shift marginal
import demand to higher grades of rice and higher incomes in many importing countries result
in increased demand for better-quality rice.
54.     Higher incomes around the world largely explain this shift. Even in Africa, demand
for higher-quality rice is increasing. Removal of state-buying monopolies allowed the African
market to diversify from importing just low grades of rice to a mix of qualities. Africa’s share
of the world trade climbed from 31 percent in the mid-1990s to 39 percent during 2010-2012.
Government import agencies such as Bulog in Indonesia and National Food Authority in the
Philippines changed their procurement standards to respond to consumer demand. For example,
Bulog switched from 25 percent to 15 percent broken rice; National Food Authority added 5
percent and 15 percent to its 25 percent broken brokens purchases; and Iran is shifting
purchases from 5 percent white rice to Pusa 112, a Basmati variety.
55.     The target countries can join this higher-quality rice market. Cambodia has already
joined its fragrant rice segment. Myanmar is trying to enter the parboiled market segment. Yet
all three countries will be better off if they take more actions to improve rice quality further
and increase rice variety options to fully capitalize on the global market opportunities.

  During this period, Vietnam started to import a lot of paddy from Cambodia, including aromatic varieties.
This paddy could have been milled and sold as Vietnamese rice, another example of interlinkages in GMS.

   (ii)     Competition with other crops

56.    As incomes have risen across the world and urbanization increased, diets have
diversified and substitution has occurred between types of food. The composition of diets
changes as wealthier consumers shift to more preferred, income-elastic food. The pattern and
speed of dietary change differ across countries, with a declining share of dietary calories from
starchy staples and a switch toward more diversified food (World Bank 2015c). In East Asia
as a whole, rice consumption is declining among urban populations and higher-income groups
as
57.shown  by the
       Figure    examples of Indonesia (Figure 14) and Vietnam (
               15).

58.     The share of rice in regional caloric intake is projected to decline, continuing the
earlier trend. It fell from 48 percent in 1985 to 38 percent in 2009 (World Bank 2015c) and
total calories from rice are projected to drop by 4 percent by 2030 (Table 24). Total caloric
intake of cereals will grow slowly, but indirect cereal and oilseed consumption as feed will
grow much more rapidly, in proportion to the demand for meat.

59.    The value of food demand in East Asia is expected to increase by 30 percent
between 2009 and 2030 in constant dollars. In 2030, the value of demand for fish, milk, meat,
and vegetables is projected at five times the aggregate value for rice and other cereals (World
Bank 2015c). The higher attractiveness of non-rice products will put huge pressure on rice
production, which competes for land, labor, and capital with other crops and agricultural
products.

target countries. In Cambodia, the gross profitability of non-paddy crops was found to be
higher than that of paddy (Table 25), and the profitability gap favoring other crops increased
between 2005 and 2013.

61.    In Vietnam, the comparator country, paddy is also less profitable than other crops.

62.     The situation of relative profitability is similar in Myanmar, but with more
nuances. The profitability of wet season paddy derived from a sample of 1,728 farm
households was the lowest among all crops in 2013/14 (Table 27). Yet the profitability of dry
season paddy was higher than that of chickpeas, while lower than that of all other crops studied.
For example, the profitability of green gram was twice as high as that of dry season paddy. As
paddy production is supported by various government programs, including subsidized working
capital loans through the Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank, the financial profitability
of dry season paddy is relatively higher than that of other crops, due to the higher cost of
working capital available to producers of other crops. Even with this subsidy, paddy will
continue to be challenged by the higher profitability of other crops, for the simple reason of its

63.     Rice is not only less profitable in many areas, it is also costlier to produce. In
Myanmar, for example, the total production cost of dry season paddy was estimated at $626/ha
in 2013/14 (Table 28). In comparison, the production cost of sunflower seeds was $121/ha,
black gram $237/ha, and groundnuts $421/ha. Other crops are also much less labor and water
intensive than paddy, which makes a big difference in environments characterized by high
capital costs, expensive inputs, and limited water.
64.     The higher profitability of non-paddy crops and growing demand for them put
competitive pressure on paddy production in the target countries. This pressure may not
be very high during the wet season, as excessive moisture favors paddy over other crops, but it
certainly matters during the cool and dry seasons. Seen from another perspective, the higher
profitability of other crops offers a great opportunity to diversify rice-based farming systems,
making them more profitable, sustainable, and resilient to climate change.

65.     It should be noted that direct comparison of gross and net margins among crops
has its limits. Margins convey “potential” but do not tell anything about perceived and actual
risks for non-paddy crops arising from more limited knowledge about agronomics, lack of
seeds, possibly higher post-harvest losses and possibly higher output price volatility, and less
developed markets with fewer intermediaries, among other things. Weather also matters – it is
much easier to diversify away from paddy in lowland areas during the dry season when water
levels are low than during the monsoon season when most lowland is flooded. A farmer who
is struggling with paddy productivity or quality is likely to have problems handling other crops


                                                 28
that require more specialized knowledge or more attentive care. Diversification would be more
successful on the back of superior paddy cultivation performance than as an alternative to
struggling paddy cultivation. There may also be a generational issue. In Indonesia it is
relatively young farmers, in their 20s and 30s who have gone into horticulture. Many older
farmers may want to simply promote diversified livelihood strategies, combining rice, other
crops, small livestock, and off-farm activities where rice production provides food security,
instead of diversifying entirely away from rice production.

   (iii)   Nutrition

66.     The target countries are confronted with nutrition-related challenges. Although
malnutrition has various types (e.g., stunting, wasting, underweight, micronutrient deficiencies,
and overweight and obesity; World Bank 2013a), in GMS countries the largest current
nutritional issue seems to be child stunting (Table 29). Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar are
all in child stunting hotspots on the world map (Figure 16). While the target countries have
made good progress in reducing extreme poverty in recent years, their progress on improving
nutrition has been much slower.

       Source: World Health Organization’s Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition.

67.    Child stunting is among the most important malnutrition problems in GMS
countries. The prevalence of stunting among children under five is much higher than that of
wasting and overweight, two other serious malnutrition problems in low-income countries
(Table 29). Obesity of adults is also a lesser issue in the target countries than child stunting
(Figure 17).

68.     Child stunting in the target countries is well above the 20 percent threshold of
moderate stunting countries (Figure 17). During 2009-2013, the stunting rate among children
under five years old was 44 percent in Lao PDR, 35 percent in Myanmar, and 33 percent in
Cambodia (Table 30). Thailand and Vietnam had much lower stunting rates for the same
period.

69.     High child stunting in the target countries is a result of many factors, and
addressing it requires multisectoral approach, but rice also matters. One of the reasons for
high stunting in these countries is consumers’ overreliance on rice in overall food consumption.
Recall that Table 1 shows that rice accounts for more than 65 percent of total caloric intake in
the target countries, while IRRI’s recommended caloric consumption of carbohydrate-rich food
(such as rice, bread, pasta, and potatoes) is less than 50 percent of total caloric intake. But rice
is low in fat (4 percent) and protein (7 percent) and provides mainly carbohydrates (89 percent)


                                                30
for energy. In addition, the most popular type of rice among consumers is white, well-polished
rice, which has a low level of micronutrients, as these are lost when removing the bran layer
during the milling and polishing process (Table 31).
70.      While better nutrition requires a diversification of diets, rice can still be part of
the solution for improving nutrition. First, profitability of rice production would need to
increase to bring more income to rice-producing households. Second, rice prices cannot be
artificially inflated, as consumers will overpay for rice and have less disposable income
available to buy other, more nutritious food. And third, rice value chains are to be supported to
become more nutrition-sensitive. Rice will continue to be important for hunger and poverty
reduction and in this context it can be better utilized to improve nutrition.

71.     Higher agricultural income from selling rice can indeed help reduce malnutrition.
Strong empirical evidence finds that income poverty and undernutrition are correlated (World
Bank 2013a; 2014b) and that the higher the agricultural productivity, the better the nutritional
situation in a country (Figure 18). Low agricultural productivity in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and
Myanmar is a large contributing factor to the high prevalence of child stunting and
micronutrient deficiency, so higher agricultural productivity in these countries is expected to
help improve nutrition.

72.    In Cambodia and Lao PDR, for which empirical data are available, higher
household income, to which agriculture contributes, is found to help reduce child
stunting. Children residing in the wealthiest households have lower stunting rates and the
impact of income on stunting seems to have increased over time (Figure 19).

73.     Vietnam can also offer lessons on how agricultural income matters for nutrition.
Despite continuously increasing volumes of rice production and exports, malnutrition among
paddy farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam’s rice bowl, remains high. This is because fewer
and fewer households there can continue to earn a livelihood from intensive rice monoculture—
even with improved yields over time. A 2010 survey found that in traditional rice-growing
areas, households with landholdings of less than 1 ha earned the largest proportion of their
income from non-farm (and especially non-agricultural) sources (Table 32). Households with
between 1 and 3 ha shared their income sources evenly among paddy sales, animal product
sales, and off-farm activity. Only households with more than 3 ha earned a large majority of



                                             32
their (above poverty line) income from paddy sales, while even three crops of paddy would not
allow small farmers to earn incomes above the poverty line.

74.     Rice prices play a role in nutrition. Prices are relatively low in Cambodia and
Myanmar but are high in Lao PDR, partially explaining its higher stunting rates. Cambodia and
Myanmar are the largest net exporters of rice amongst the target countries and their domestic
prices are at levels similar to those of other rice exporters, such as India, Thailand, and Vietnam
(Table 33).

75.     Continuing to keep them in line with the market and avoiding the temptation to
artificially elevate prices to support domestic production are prerequisites for better
nutrition as well as long-term competitiveness necessary to allow exports. In Lao PDR,
however, rice prices are closer to those of net importers (China, Indonesia, and the Philippines),
which protect their domestic markets with high import barriers, resulting in high taxation of
their consumers. High rice prices in Lao PDR are the result of many factors, including still low
rice surpluses available for export, consumers’ preferences for glutinous rice, and the small
regional market for glutinous rice. Regardless of the reasons for high prices in Lao PDR, they


                                                33
reduce consumers’ purchasing power to buy more nutritious food. Efforts in Lao PDR could
focus on increased farm productivity and reduced marketing costs to eventually reduce rice
prices for consumers.
76.      To further increase its contribution to better nutrition, rice value chains can
become more “nutrition-sensitive.” This implies: (i) increasing the nutritional value of rice;
and (ii) empowering women by increasing their discretionary agricultural income and reducing
time and labor constraints. The empirical evidence suggests that the gender gains are powerful
enough to improve the nutrition of all household members (IFPRI 2014a; World Bank 2013a;
FAO 2012a). While rice cannot provide all nutrients and vitamins, its nutritional value can be
increased through interventions at various stages of the value chain. Table 34 describes
potential entry points for interventions, from input supply to consumers.

77.     The lack of readily available bio-fortified rice seeds and some consumers’
reluctance to eat genetically modified foods such as Golden rice (a vitamin A bio-fortified
seed variety) prevent quick improvements in the area of input supply . Convincing
consumers to switch from low nutrition (but easy to cook) white rice to higher nutrition brown
and parboiled rice is difficult (Table 35 shows the key characteristics of various rice types).
This underscores the importance of finding other ways to achieve quick results. The most
promising entry points for interventions in GMS countries seem to be in paddy production and
rice milling.

78.     At the production level, promotion of crop rotations offers high rates of return for
rice-based farming systems. Legumes, for example, can complement rice in both production
and consumption. During the production cycle, legumes improve soil fertility and require less
water than paddy. Their rotation with paddy can also help control diseases and pests. And they
are often more profitable than rice or can be consumed directly by the members of producing
households, contributing to their better nutrition. Further, the amino acids in legumes are


                                                 34
complementary to those in rice so joint consumption of rice and legumes is especially
nutritious. Intercropping with fish is also desirable. Fish can be raised in fields with lowland
rice; this practice occurs in Indonesia and Vietnam, but is still rare in other GMS countries.
The benefits from rice-fish cropping systems are many, including enhanced nutrition and
reduced pesticide use (ACDI/VOCA 2014).
79.      At the processing/milling level, rice fortification is an emerging technology to
increase the nutritional value of white milled rice. Fortifying rice is conceptually similar to
fortifying other staple foods but it involves additional processing and handling (USAID 2008).
Coating, cold and hot extrusions, and dusting technologies are available but their uptake in
Asia remains very low. Why? On the one hand, a fragmented milling sector with hundreds and
often thousands of small mills increases the cost of compliance with fortification and makes it
very difficult to enforce mandatory fortification, which is required for wide adoption of
fortification technologies and consequent cost reduction. On the other hand, consumers are not
yet familiar with fortified rice, increasing marketing risks for mills. Fortification is still a
promising way to increase the nutritional value of rice but more efforts are required with respect
to technology, policy, and consumer awareness to achieve high-impact results.

80.    Empowering women is good for nutrition outcomes. Several studies have estimated
the impact (see van der Bold et al. 2013 for a literature review). For example, in Bangladesh
greater empowerment of women (measured by attitudes towards abuse, decision-making
power, and mobility) and maternal characteristics such as education and height were associated
with greater dietary diversity scores and reduced child stunting. Cross-country studies found
that over half of the reduction in child underweight from 1970 to 1995 was attributable to
improvement in women’s status. In agricultural activities, increasing women’s discretionary
income and reducing women’s time and labor constraints appear to be especially important to
improve nutrition (World Bank 2013a).
81.     Women play an important role in the rice sector of GMS countries. Roles played
by both men and women in rice production and cultivation vary to different degrees, depending
on the country, geography, and culture (WOCAN 2015). Women in the countries along the
Mekong Delta and throughout Asia usually take on the roles of weeding, transplanting, and
harvesting rice, while men are tasked with preparing land/clearing fields, ploughing, making
bundles, preparing seedbeds, transporting seedlings, irrigating, applying fertilizer, and spraying
pesticides. With the high migration of Asian men to cities and other countries, women have
taken on a greater workload in rice production. Yet they often face under-attention from


                                                  35
extension and other public programs. Women are often less educated than men, which affects
their productivity. In some countries, women are still viewed as laborers or wives of farmers,
not as farmers themselves, and they have unequal rights to own land or access credit. The
above-mentioned constraints require urgent attention. Promising intervention areas include: (i)
improvement of human capital and access to productive assets; (ii) access to factor and output
markets; and (iii) strengthened voice and participation. Table 36 presents actions across these
areas for Cambodia that are also highly applicable to other GMS countries.

                         When delivering training, recognize different extension needs for women
                         versus men due to their different roles in agricultural production chains, as

   (iv)    Climate change

82.     Environmental degradation associated with intensive rice production systems is
an increasing concern. Inappropriate and excessive use of agro-chemicals (fertilizers,
pesticides) and increasing water use have resulted in an unsustainable level of water depletion,
water pollution, soil erosion, and downstream silting in many Asian countries. Important
ecosystem functions provided by rice fields are being compromised. The decline in biodiversity
and loss of rice culture and heritage are other important manifestations of damage to ecosystem
functions, sometimes resulting in a resurgence of pests that significantly threaten national
production (FAO 2014b).
83.     Moreover, paddy production emits GHGs. Paddy is often grown in flooded fields
under anaerobic soil conditions that release methane (CH4), a GHG about 20 times more potent
than carbon dioxide. In addition, application of nitrogen fertilizers in rice cultivation may result
in emissions of nitrous oxide, another type of GHG that is about 300 times more potent than
carbon dioxide (Chen and Damen 2014). Paddy straw and husk residues are often burned or
incorporated back into the soil after harvest. When returned to the soil, CH4 is produced as
decomposition occurs under waterlogged conditions; when burned, soot develops and
contributes to GHG emissions.
84.     Paddy rice cultivation is estimated to contribute 10 percent of the annual global
GHG emissions originating in agriculture. In addition, fertilization adds another 16 percent,
in a process closely related to that of paddy cultivation (Figure 20). Paddy is the second largest
crop contributing to emissions (Figure 21), and during 2000-2010, 94 percent of GHG
emissions from paddy came from developing countries (Chen and Damen 2014), with Asia
responsible for almost 90 percent of the total.

      Figure 20: Sources of global GHG                    Figure 21: Global emissions by

85.     Going forward, agriculture, which emits 13 percent of GHGs (Figure 20), is
expected to contribute to mitigation of climate change, which itself seriously affects the
sector. To attain the goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degree Celsius, total global


                                                37
emissions must fall to 21-22 G tons of CO2 equivalent by 2050. For the agriculture sector to
contribute its fair share to meeting the 2 degree Celsius target, the required cuts are estimated
at two-thirds of the current level (WRI 2013).

                  Figure 22: Agricultural emissions by region and source




86.     In GMS countries, the largest potential for mitigation seems to be in sustainable
rice production and reforestation, as their livestock sectors are still weakly developed and
fertilizer use is not yet excessive (see Table 38 in Chapter 4). Sustainable increase in
productivity will help reduce the need to cut forests, while improved water, nutrient, and
residue management can further contribute to climate change mitigation (see more on
sustainable rice cultivation in Box 1):
       a. Water-saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) reduce the
          time rice fields are flooded and can therefore reduce CH4 emissions. This can reduce
          the amount of water use by up to 40 percent. Allowing the soil to dry out
          intermittently lets in air and prevents buildup of anaerobic bacteria responsible for
          CH4 production; this has been shown to reduce CH4 emissions from rice by up to
          50 percent (World Bank forthcoming).
       b. Proper application of nitrogen fertilizers combined with water-saving technologies
          and good nutrient management can reduce field nitrogen losses and therefore
          nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrogen use efficiency can be improved by better
          matching the nitrogen supply from fertilizers with the nitrogen requirements of
          crops and through crop diversification by rotating paddy and legumes that fix
          nitrogen biologically (World Bank forthcoming).
       c. Charring or partly burning rice residues and adding the obtained black carbon to
          paddy fields could reduce field CH4 emissions (Chen and Damen 2014).
87.    In summary, all of the above-described challenges must be addressed and the
opportunities capitalized on to leverage rice sector development for poverty reduction.
Chapter 4 presents an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of rice value chains in GMS
countries in view of their readiness to do so.

   CHAPTER 4: RICE VALUE CHAINS: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
88.    The previous chapters demonstrate that rice can play a large role in growth and
poverty reduction in GMS countries. Are the rice value chains in the target countries
competitive enough to play such a role? Can they capitalize on the emerging opportunities and
withstand/address the challenges? How do the problems differ across countries and what are
the key areas for improvements? And how do the target countries fare compared to Thailand
and Vietnam?
89.     This chapter presents a comparative analysis of rice value chains in five GMS
countries. It presents the situation for the main rice-producing areas in 2013/14 using a list of
policy-applicable, easy-to-measure indicators. Cambodia is represented by the Southeast
provinces; Lao PDR by Savannakhet province; Myanmar by Ayeyarwady region/Delta;
Thailand by the Central Plains; and Vietnam by the Mekong Delta. The segments of the rice
value chains include input supply, production, milling, and exports. These results are not
nationally representative; they reflect the situation in these countries’ main lowland rice-
producing areas (“rice bowls”), which are the key to supplying rice for domestic markets and
export. The information was collected and estimates made by rice experts with support from
the WBG and FAO, as described in Box 2.



                    Box 2: Data Sources for Rice Value Chain Analysis

   In Cambodia, the background report was prepared by Sok Muniroth, a rice expert. Sources of
   information included reports of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; data from
   the Ministry of Commerce, including the Single Window Service Unit; Cambodia Rice
   Federation; rice value chain studies; and interviews with traders, rice millers, and farmers.
   In Lao PDR, the background report was prepared by Emerging Markets Consulting firm.
   Sources of information included reports and data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry;
   data from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; and rice value chain studies.
   In Myanmar, the background report was prepared by Larry Wong and Daphne Khin Swe Swe
   Aye, consultants, in collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce. Sources of information
   included reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation; reports from the Ministry of
   Commerce; Myanmar Rice Federation; rice value chain studies; and interviews with millers
   and traders.
   In Thailand, the background report was prepared by Dr. Isriya Nitithanprapas Bunyasiri,
   Kasetsart University. Sources of information included data from the National Statistics Office;
   data of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce; surveys conducted by
   Kasetsart University; Thai Rice Exporters Association; and reports of the Knowledge Network
   Institute of Thailand, Thailand Research Fund, and Thailand Development and Research
   Institute.
   In Vietnam, the background report was prepared by the Center for Agrarian Systems Research
   and Development (CASRAD). Sources of information included the statistical books of
   Vietnam; statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of
   Industry and Trade; and the CASRAD database.



90.     The target countries produce various types of rice. Cambodia produces ordinary
(Indica) white rice varieties but in recent years it significantly increased production of
aromatic/fragrant varieties (for export), which are higher valued. Myanmar produces ordinary


                                                 39
white rice varieties, exporting low-quality and broken rice. Lao PDR produces mainly
glutinous (sticky) rice. In comparison, Thailand produces all mentioned types of rice (Indica,
aromatic/Jasmine, and glutinous) in large quantities, while Vietnam mainly produces Indica
rice, with a recent increase in the production of aromatic/fragrant varieties. The existence of so
many different rice varieties makes it difficult to construct typical value chains and present a
single cost breakdown from input to export markets. Yet where relevant and possible, the
analysis below presents data for different types of rice.
91.     The analysis shows that rice value chains in the target countries are less
competitive than those in Thailand and Vietnam, and large room for improvement exists
at all stages. Among the target countries, Cambodia has made the most progress in recent
years, especially in the production, milling, and export segments. Raising paddy productivity
in a sustainable manner remains the biggest challenge in all target countries, particularly due
to problems with the availability of affordable, good-quality seeds and the lack of high-quality
extension services. Increasing regional and global demand for higher-quality and safer rice is
both a challenge and an opportunity, requiring the highest attention to these issues in the target
countries going forward.

Input Supply
92.     The profitability of paddy production depends on access to good-quality and
affordable inputs, especially seeds and fertilizers. Table 37 presents the indicators of
availability, access, and affordability of these inputs. It shows that adequate seed supply is a
big problem in all target countries, while the main issue for fertilizers is their affordability and
efficiency of use.
93.    Availability of seed presents a large constraint to increasing paddy production and
productivity. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, the current supply of paddy seeds meets only 10
percent of the demand.12 In Myanmar this ratio is below 1 percent. In comparison, demand in
Thailand and Vietnam is fully met by supply, so farmers have a large volume of seeds from
which to select. Most farmers in the target countries use their own saved seeds, which can be
used productively only for three years from the date of their purchase.
94.      Most farmers in the target countries, though less so in Lao PDR, use fertilizers for
paddy production. Cambodian farmers on average use a balanced mix of fertilizers, applying
both urea and NPK, while Laotian and Myanmar farmers seem to use mainly urea, thereby
underusing phosphorus and potassium. As the analysis below shows, the level of the overall
fertilizer use is below the frequently recommended optimum of 90 kg of nitrogen per hectare.
Yet a further significant increase depends on fertilizer affordability, which is linked to paddy
profitability. Urea prices were about the same across countries, ranging from $425/ton in
Cambodia to $460/ton in Myanmar in 2013/14, so not much gain can be expected from
lowering fertilizer prices in the target countries as they are close to regional and global
averages. At the same time, paddy prices differed significantly. Myanmar stands out as the
least attractive location for using fertilizers for paddy production. The ratio of urea prices to
paddy prices in Myanmar was 2.3 compared to 1.6 in Lao PDR and Vietnam and 1.8 in
Cambodia.
95.    The future productivity and profitability of paddy production in the target
countries depends on the resolution of constraints for an increased supply of seeds. The

12
   Demand is estimated as follows: total paddy sown area is multiplied by 50 kg of seeds per hectare, and this
figure is divided by three given that openly pollinated varieties maintain high yield characteristics during the
three years of planting and replanting.


                                                        40
challenge is not only producing more seeds, but producing the right seeds of high quality. The
future profitability also depends on reducing input prices, along with a relative increase of
farm-gate output prices, which can be achieved through paddy quality improvements (drying
and cleaning of paddy, for example, with the help of farmers’ groups), shifts to higher-value
rice varieties such as aromatic ones, and reduced transaction costs between producers and
consumers.

Farm Production
96.     Farm production is analyzed through the lens of land and labor productivity and
profitability indicators. The target countries lag behind Thailand and Vietnam on these
indicators in most respects. First, they have lower average yields. When paddy is harvested,
the wet paddy yields of ordinary rice in the main producing areas of Cambodia and Myanmar
average 3 tons/ha (Table 38). Wet paddy yields are twice as high in the Central Plains of
Thailand and more than twice as high in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. The difference is even larger
in dry paddy equivalent, a standard way of making cross-country yield comparisons. The issue
is that harvested paddy contains different levels of moisture, reaching 25 percent in some
countries, and foreign matter (dirt). Comparing yields across countries requires an adjustment
of moisture content to 14 percent and of foreign matter to zero.
97.     Note that the average yield of aromatic varieties is lower than that of ordinary
varieties. Yet they are priced higher and therefore compensate for lower productivity. Yields
are again the highest in Vietnam, but its aromatic varieties are considered to be of lower quality
than those in Cambodia and Thailand, so they receive lower prices (Table 45).

source of nuclear acids, and K stands for potassium, a catalyst and ion transport.

98.     Other clear differences arise between these two groups – the target countries and
Thailand with Vietnam – which partially explain differences in land productivity (yields).
The average use of nitrogen fertilizers in the target countries is well below the recommended
90 kg/ha of nitrogen in the wet season (Table 38). Thai farmers are close to optimum while
Vietnamese farmers overuse nitrogen fertilizers due to their subsidized price (Table 37) and
the strong push from extension services to apply fertilizers. The vast majority of farmers in the
rice bowls of Thailand and Vietnam use machines for land preparation and harvesting, while
the use of machinery is much smaller in the target countries, especially for harvesting.
Myanmar farmers still widely use animal power for paddy cultivation. Most farmers in the
target countries transplant paddy in the wet season, which is often considered to lead to higher
yields. Yields still lag behind those in Thailand and Vietnam, where the majority of farmers
broadcast seeds, indicating that they compensate for losses from broadcasting by other means
such as better seeds, more fertilizers, better nutrient management, and smaller harvest losses.

99.     Low land yields in the target countries lead to low land profitability. The average
profit of the wet season paddy production was $142/ha in Lao PDR and $135/ha in Myanmar
(Table 39). Land profit was more than twice as high in Cambodia, at $342/ha, but still much

lower than the profits achieved in Vietnam and Thailand.14 Profit from aromatic varieties in
Cambodia was higher than that of ordinary varieties.15 Lao PDR and Myanmar do not produce
a large quantity of fragrant varieties so their farmers could not benefit from higher profitability
of fragrant rice.

100. The difference in land profits was a result not only of yield differences, but also
different output prices and production costs. For ordinary varieties, paddy prices were the
lowest in Myanmar, which also had the lowest production costs (Table 39). Paddy prices were
a bit higher in Cambodia and its production costs were lower than in both Myanmar and
Vietnam. Glutinous paddy prices in Lao PDR were much lower than in Thailand, but higher
than in Vietnam.
101. The gap between Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar on one hand and Thailand
and Vietnam on the other was even larger for labor productivity and profitability than
for land-related indicators. The labor indicators are most important as they reflect on labor
income, the key indicator of economic development. Labor productivity expressed in both kg
and $ per working day was lowest in Myanmar and highest in Thailand (Table 40). Differences
among countries were very large, and Lao PDR together with Myanmar lag significantly
behind their neighbors. The highest labor productivity was in Thailand, as labor has been
replaced by mechanization. Only an estimated 6 days/ha were used for paddy production in
Thailand compared to 100 days in Lao PDR and 130 days in Myanmar. The difference in labor
use is a result of labor cost differences. The cost of one day’s work was $9.5 in Thailand
compared with only $2.2 in Myanmar during the wet season of 2013/14.
102. Labor productivity is a more useful indicator than land productivity for policy
makers to monitor the progress achieved in farm incomes. Higher land productivity can be
achieved through higher input use, including more labor input, and sometimes the costs of
higher labor use exceed the benefits of extra yield. Alternatively, lower labor use can lead to
lower yields but still generate higher income per capita. Going forward, policy makers are

14
   Profit and other price-related data in Thailand need to be carefully interpreted as they are influenced by the
rice pledging scheme, which artificially increased paddy prices. After the discontinuation of this scheme in
2014, paddy prices and profits reportedly now approach the levels observed in Vietnam.
15
   Again, the rice pledging scheme in 2013/14 distorted relative profitability figures in Thailand. Fragrant
varieties were not provided with a price premium over ordinary rice, resulting in a temporary increase of
profitability of ordinary over fragrant rice.


                                                        43
recommended to pay the same attention to labor productivity as they pay to land productivity.
This does not mean that yield data can be written off. It is still useful to show the extent of
realization of land use potential and these data are readily available for cross-country
comparisons in contrast to labor productivity data.
103. The target countries lag behind their peers in their capacity to produce two crops
per year. In Lao PDR, only 87,000 farm households reported producing dry season paddy
compared to 775,000 households producing paddy during the monsoon period in 2010/11
(MAF 2012). In the primary survey of 1,728 farming households in four regions of Myanmar,
only 336 households were found to have produced dry season paddy compared to 1,373
households producing paddy during the monsoon season (LIFT and World Bank 2016). As a
result, dry season paddy production accounts for a small share in total paddy production. In
Lao PDR, it accounts for 13 percent (Table 39). Its share is higher in Cambodia (23 percent)
and Myanmar (18 percent), but these are still much lower than in Thailand (43 percent) and
Vietnam (54 percent). This reduces income-generation opportunities as dry season paddy is
more profitable in many countries than monsoon paddy (recall Table 25 for Cambodia and
Table 27 for Myanmar). This also disrupts the flow of paddy for milling and eventually exports,
requiring longer storage and more working capital to process paddy harvested only during 2-3
months in a year (monsoon season harvest).

104. The target countries’ low capacity to produce paddy in the dry season is a result
of low irrigation coverage and inefficiencies. Irrigation serves between 15-25 percent of
monsoon paddy areas in the target countries, providing complementary water (Table 41). In
the dry season, however, most irrigation systems supply water to only a fraction of the irrigated
areas serviced in the monsoon season. The situation is different in Thailand and Vietnam’s
main producing areas, where irrigation water is available year round.
105. In principle, low production of paddy in the dry season can be compensated for
by higher production of other crops. Rotation with other crops and crop diversification are
actually beneficial for restoration of soil nutrients, farm incomes, and consumers’ nutrition. In
practice, however, rice farming systems in the target countries remain weakly diversified. A
small fraction of Cambodian and Laotian farmers produce vegetables, cassava, and maize, but
most production of these crops occurs in uplands, not in lowland rice farming systems (MAF
2012; World Bank and AusAid 2015). Rice-based farming systems are more diversified in
Myanmar’s dry season: 60 percent of farmers produce a second crop, mainly beans and pulses
and oilseeds (LIFT and World Bank 2016). But even in Myanmar, the sown area covered by


                                                  44
second crops remains limited as farmers lack access to good seeds, finance, and extension
services, and are sometimes forced to produce summer paddy or nothing on the land assigned
for paddy production, a policy still practiced in public irrigation systems.

Rice Mills
106. Rice mills are important actors in rice value chains. They are intermediaries between
farmers and traders, and eventually consumers. In open economies, where farm-gate prices are
determined by the difference between export prices and marketing and milling costs, rice mills
are expected to be efficient and service-oriented to increase farmers’ incentives and to
strengthen the rice value chain. Rice mills are expected to be not only cost-efficient but also
able to produce high-quality rice for different market segments. They are expected to provide
various services to farmers such as post-harvest and extension services. In this report, the
strength of rice mills in GMS countries is measured by four groups of indicators: market
competitiveness, attractiveness for FDI, milling efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
107. In all GMS countries, there are many rice mills in operation. Many of them are
small and are not officially registered (Table 42). But even the number of larger and registered
mills is high in GMS countries. Although some larger mills have a monopoly position in local
markets in some countries, competition among mills appears to be very high at the national
level. Some consolidation may even be necessary to increase the industry’s competitiveness
vis-à-vis peers without the loss of free competition in the domestic market.

108. Cambodian mills attract the most FDI, which has allowed them to rapidly
converge with more modern Thai mills. In 2013/14, about 25 percent of registered
Cambodian mills obtained FDI, while in 2009 this figure was close to zero (Sok 2015; World
Bank 2014a). Most FDI to Cambodia originates in Thailand. In contrast, FDI is still a rarity in
Lao PDR and Myanmar, in spite of recent efforts to attract it, especially in Myanmar since the
start of its economic and political transition in 2011 (LIFT and World Bank 2014). FDI in rice
mills is also small in Thailand and Vietnam due to preferential treatment of local investors in
these countries, but Lao PDR and Myanmar lack the domestic capital and international trade
expertise of Vietnam and especially Thailand. They would benefit from following Cambodia’s

strategy of creating a favorable environment for FDI in their rice milling industry to overcome
these weaknesses.

109. The efficiency of rice mills in the target countries is lower than that found in
Thailand and Vietnam. Target countries’ mills are run half of the period observed in Thailand
and Vietnam and their capacity utilization is only 50 percent (Table 42). In comparison,
capacity utilization is estimated at 58 percent in Thailand and 71 percent in Vietnam. The
milling ratio, which shows the conversion of paddy into rice, averages 60 percent in Lao PDR
and Myanmar; thanks to recent FDI, it rose to 64 percent in Cambodia. Yet this is lower than
the 66 percent observed on average in Thailand and Vietnam. If Myanmar could increase its
average milling ratio to 66 percent, however, its production of rice in 2013/14 would have risen
by 10 percent without the need to increase paddy production (Table 43).

110. Myanmar’s average milling costs are closer to those of Thailand and Vietnam.
This is partially due to comparable electricity prices among these three countries, although an
estimated 35 percent of mills in Myanmar run on diesel, the largest share in the GMS (Table
42). In Lao PDR, milling costs are high in spite of relatively low electricity prices, while
Cambodian mills suffer from high electricity prices, forcing them to use diesel or gasifiers. FDI
in Cambodian mills reduced milling costs but they still remain the highest in the region,


                                                    46
partially explaining why Cambodian mills have difficulty competing with Vietnamese traders
for paddy produced in Cambodia.
111. Many mills face electricity cutoffs, so they either idle their plants or use diesel
generators. But diesel is much more expensive than electricity. Gasifiers burning readily
available rice husks offer an alternative to diesel, cutting diesel usage by three-fourths if good
equipment is used. Rice millers in the target countries are generally aware of this alternative,
especially in Cambodia where about half of all mills use them (Table 42). But many in Lao
PDR and Myanmar are uncertain about employing gasifiers as they realize that the technology
can pollute the environment and poison workers. There is a pressing need for governments and
donors to provide information on sources of “green” biomass gasifiers and proper operating
practices, and promote them in partnerships with the private sector, as improving access to
reliable and affordable electricity in rural areas will take much time.

Exports
112. As all GMS countries are net exporters of rice, the strength of the value chain
depends on export competitiveness. A common feature of the target countries is that their
export volumes are still much lower than those of Thailand and Vietnam (Table 44). Another
common feature is their high reliance on cross-border trade. Yet in terms of other aspects of
export performance, Cambodia is closer to Thailand and Vietnam than to the other two target
countries. Cambodian openness to trade is high, reflected in: (i) its export of 39 percent of rice
production, a ratio even higher than in Thailand and Vietnam (in contrast, Lao PDR and
Myanmar export only a fraction of their production, up to 10 percent); and (ii) its permission
to export both paddy and rice, with paddy exports accounting for 70 percent of its total exports
(while both Lao PDR and Myanmar ban the export of paddy).
113. Cambodia is also closer to Thailand and Vietnam in terms of extent of competition
on the export market. The five largest rice exporters in Cambodia control 42 percent of FOB
trade, compared to 34 percent in Vietnam and 54 percent in Thailand (Table 44). Myanmar’s
export market is much more concentrated: the five largest exporters account for 89 percent of
FOB exports. This high concentration increases the risk that exporters will transfer their
inefficiencies and losses to domestic traders and millers, and eventually to farmers.
114. Cambodia is performing superbly in terms of export profitability. While it sells
mainly paddy across the border to Vietnam, FOB exports consist of high-quality ordinary rice
(5 percent broken and less) and fragrant rice (Table 45). For its rice it gets FOB prices much
higher than Myanmar and Vietnam do, although its fragrant rice is sold cheaper than Thai
Jasmine rice. As a result, the effective price of Cambodian exports in 2013/14 was $412/ton,
compared to $342/ton in Myanmar, $404/ton in Vietnam, and $656/ton in Thailand. Cambodia
still has a large potential to improve the quality of its existing export portfolio to catch up with
Thailand and to add more types of rice (for example, parboiled rice).
115. Myanmar must do more work to increase the profitability of its exports. Its main
export item is low-quality broken rice with an average FOB price of only $339/ton. The
dominance of this type of rice is a result of many factors, including poor paddy quality, multiple
rice varieties, a poor seed quality control system, and inefficient rice mills (LIFT and World
Bank 2014). Addressing these issues is essential to increase export profitability to generate
higher profits for millers and paddy producers.

116. Increasing export volumes and profitability requires cost-effective export
logistics.16 Export competitiveness can be assessed by comparing the costs of port services and
export service and document fees charged by government agencies. It is five times more
expensive to serve a 20,000-ton vessel in Myanmar’s Yangon Port than in HMC Port in
Vietnam and three times more expensive than in Bangkok Port in Thailand (Table 46). Yangon
Port’s high costs lead to high deductions from the export value of rice required to keep
Myanmar rice competitive on global markets. Myanmar, however, fares well with regard to
export processing costs and costs charged by government agencies. Export procedures there
cost $2.80/ton compared to $2.34/ton in Thailand and $8.75/ton in Vietnam. Costs of export
procedures are very large in Cambodia ($16.7/ton), although these are down from $20/ton in
2012 (World Bank 2014a). As most FOB export in Cambodia is fragrant rice with an average
price of $850/ton, these high export costs do not restrict exports, but they still result in lower
incomes for rice actors across the value chain, and make the export of ordinary rice
uncompetitive.

  Increasing export and profitability also depends on good management of exchange rate. Analysis of the link
between the exchange rate and export competitiveness of rice in GMS countries goes beyond the scope of this
report, however.

                CHAPTER 5: FUTURE RICE POLICY AGENDA
117. Across Asia, governments have traditionally viewed food and food security
through the lens of rice production. Public policy and public expenditures on agriculture
centered predominantly on raising productivity and expanding rice output, and on domestic
market margins and international trade or farm income support. Output and input subsidies,
agricultural research, advisory services, and investments in irrigation were all oriented
primarily to achieving national targets of rice output and, recently, gross exports. This policy
and public spending bias persisted in the face of changing economics and consumer behavior.
Issues such as productivity and diversification, food quality and safety, sustainability of
production and processing, trade promotion, rice branding, efficiency of rice mills, and overall
increased competitiveness are gradually gaining importance, yet they remain overshadowed by
the more traditional policy focus.
118. Supporting rice production and trade will remain important in the target GMS
countries. Yet in the context of emerging opportunities and challenges discussed in Chapter 3,
governments are advised to expand their focus from rice production to a multidimensional
value chain support policy to effectively leverage the rice sector for poverty reduction. With
the policy shift from production support to value chain facilitation, farm income would be a
good indicator of success of policy interventions. Higher income of other value chain actors is
also important, but poverty is highest among producers so moving that part of the value chain
is the key to achieving the poverty reduction objective.
119. Focusing on farm incomes from paddy production is especially important in the
era of low global prices projected for the next 10 years. Achieving higher farm profit and
thus income is a more difficult task when output (paddy) prices are low than when they are
high. Artificial elevation of paddy prices is not a viable option for the target countries as it
would undermine their export competitiveness and would cost a substantial amount of public
funds as the recent example of Thailand has shown. Attention instead is to be paid to reduction
in costs along all segments of value chain and productivity improvements. Figure 23 illustrates
key entry points for policy actions to reduce costs and raise productivity, thereby increasing
profits along the value chain in a sustainable manner.
120. Applying a more balanced approach to food security and facilitating the
modernization of rice value chains will involve mandates extending well beyond
ministries of agriculture. Ministries of agriculture are generally slow to adjust to changes in
food demand and market situation and often do not comprehend the business-enabling
conditions required by the private sector. The target countries’ ministries of agriculture have
yet to develop the capacity for effective, proactive support for agricultural diversification and
inclusive agribusiness. Further, many emerging issues fall outside of their traditional
boundaries and mandates, relating rather to technical and regulatory bodies involved with
commerce, manufacturing, public health, and social and environmental protection.
Multidisciplinary and collaborative approaches across ministries and with a range of
stakeholders (private, public, and civil society organizations) is required. In more developed
value chains, the private sector is expected to play a dominant role in commercial activities,
with important roles for the government in facilitating investment and trade, promoting
competition, monitoring and protecting the environment, and promoting better nutrition.

121. At the input supply and farm-gate segments of the value chain, the priority is to
increase profitability of rice production that is the result of individual farmers’ choices
in combination with crop rotations for income generation and increased resilience. This
requires improving the quality of existing public programs for rice, promotion of diversification
by avoiding or abolishing the designation of rice land, and broadening the scope of agricultural
public programs to all crops.
122. The quality of existing public programs for rice can be improved substantially in
all target countries. Most resources are spent on irrigation, so the largest gains will come from
making irrigation investments more efficient and effective. Construction of irrigation systems
is to be accompanied by sustainable arrangements for operation and maintenance of these
systems through water users’ participation and adequate budget allocations. In most cases,
more gains can be achieved from rehabilitation and upgrade of existing systems by adding
drainage, reshaping canals, and ensuring better management than from new capital investments
in dams and primary infrastructure. Considerations of water security are to be made at the basin
level rather than at the irrigation system level so irrigation design is informed by more accurate
estimates of future water inflows and water availability for irrigation.
123. Among other public programs, large gains can be achieved from better extension
services, input quality assurance, and seeds. Access to fertilizers and chemicals is not a
problem in most parts of the target countries, but access to “good” quality inputs and their
efficient use are problems everywhere. Extension and quality assurance programs can cost-
effectively mitigate these deficiencies. Improvements in the seed sector are more time
consuming and complex. Yet as discussed above, the rice market consists of many varieties
and different qualities. They all have their consumers but to benefit from evolving demand,
producers must have good-quality seed. Seed systems are to be prepared to supply varieties
aligned with the evolving demand, which in turn requires close collaboration between



                                               51
agricultural ministries’ seed divisions and rice mills, traders, and the ministries of commerce
responsible for trade promotion.
124. Diversification can benefit rice farmers. In many cases, diversification is only
possible during dry seasons, but even for that to happen public programs and policies are to
expand beyond supporting rice. One such policy is land use restrictions. Through zoning laws,
land-use plans, and other means, many countries have long sought to restrict or otherwise
manage the pace and location of agricultural lands being converted to other uses. For example,
China set a national target for maintenance of aggregate agricultural lands linked to estimates
of current and future demand for cereals (Jaffee and Do Ahn Tuan 2014). Vietnam has a
longstanding policy of designating and controlling the use of rice land, on which a farmer is
not permitted to shift to perennial crops and is mandated to grow one or two seasonal rice crops.
As land restrictions often encourage production of rice at any cost, even when it is less
profitable than other crops, or production in fragile ecosystems, Vietnam is currently
reconsidering its land policy to allow a conversion of at least 10 percent of rice land for non-
rice production (Box 3).



                   Box 3: Designated Land for Rice Production in Vietnam

  Since doi moi reforms, farmers’ rights over land use in Vietnam have been greatly extended.
  However, farmers still do not have full flexibility over crop choice. The government has always
  followed a strict policy of maintaining a certain proportion of agricultural land for rice cultivation.
  In 2009, the total rice land area in Vietnam was 4.1 million ha. In the face of pressure to convert
  rice land for other agricultural and non-agricultural uses, the government plans to keep rice land at
  3.8 million ha by 2020 (designated land), which constitutes about 40 percent of total agricultural
  land in the country. The government’s aim in pursuing this policy is to ensure a sufficient supply of
  rice to meet domestic and export demands.


  In 2010-2011, a collaborative multi-institutional research program supported by the World Bank
  estimated that about 70 percent of designated land is considered by farmers to also be suitable for
  production of various crops. But in case of removal of land use restrictions, along with other reforms,
  the decline of paddy land is projected to be less dramatic than the government fears. It is projected
  to drop from 4.1 million ha in 2009 to 3.1-3.5 million ha by 2030. Paddy production will continue
  to be relatively profitable vis-à-vis other crops on most designated land, while even this small
  projected land conversion would have a large positive impact on economic growth and poverty
  reduction. Having this information helped the government to start the gradual removal of its
  designated land restrictions.
                                       Source: World Bank 2012b.



125. This is also an important issue in the target countries. Among the three, Myanmar
has the strictest rice land rules. Since 2011, this policy has been relaxed and the majority of
farmers can make their own crop decisions. But it remains enforced in public irrigation
systems. Farmland is still classified as “Le” (designated for rice) and “Ya” (designated for other
crops), and “Le” land cultivators continue to receive more support from the government than
“Ya” land cultivators. Going forward, fully eliminating this crop-specific land classification
while maintaining broadly defined farmland classification in land use plans to give farmers
clear freedom over crop selection to better meet more diversified food demand, and to provide



                                                  52
support to all farmers irrespective of their land classification, would be a good strategic policy
decision for Myanmar.
126. Cambodia and Lao PDR designate a large share of their irrigated land area
strictly to rice cultivation, and both are considering adopting a stricter rice land
designation policy similar to Vietnam’s. The experience of Vietnam and other countries
demonstrates that this approach can lock farmers into unsustainable production and such land
restrictions are hard to remove once introduced. Allowing flexibility in agricultural land use
will help meet evolving goals, and at the same time will allow a shift back to rice cultivation if
economic or national food security conditions warrant this.
127. In addition to agricultural land use flexibility, efforts can be made to help rice
farmers introduce rotation crops or a rice-aquaculture farming system, and in doing so,
raise their annual income, break the “pest and disease” cycle, and reduce adverse
environmental impacts. Farmers with diversified income sources can remain viable seasonal
rice producers, producing rice during the wet season and other crops during the dry season, for
example. Without this flexibility it may be hard to reduce the poverty of rice-producing
farmers. To support diversification, public programs financing seed sector development, soil
nutrient management, or input quality control are to go beyond rice and cover all major crops.
In addition, adjustments will be required in water management and drainage services to provide
options for crop diversification in irrigation systems. More flexible irrigation is important not
only from the point of view of profitability, but also of environmental sustainability. In addition
to traditional concerns over the operation and maintenance of irrigation systems, attention is
merited to redesign systems to allow wide adoption of climate-sensitive approaches such as
AWD and sustainable rice intensification and production.
128. In the segments of rice mills and trade, the target country governments can benefit
from entering into effective partnerships with the private sector. These partnerships could
help avoid or remove restrictions to private investment, improve logistics, establish rice
brand(s), be more proactive in rice market due diligence and market promotion, facilitate
linkages between farmers and rice mills, and improve food safety and quality.
129. Cambodia is a clear example of how the absence of restrictions attracts FDI in rice
mills. Yet, Cambodia can do more to open up for investments in seed production. Lao PDR
and Myanmar can follow Cambodia’s example by removing all restrictions on foreign
investors. In Myanmar, for example, this means permitting foreign investors to establish joint
ventures with “existing” rice mills, not just allowing them to make “green” investments. It also
means streamlining the approval process by the authorities to grant permission for foreign
investment in rice mills (LIFT and World Bank 2014).
130. The costs of export procedures, logistics, and electricity can be decreased. As
shown in Table 42 and Table 46, the scope for cost reduction and efficiency improvements in
all target countries is large. The use of green gasifiers and their proper operation by rice mills
can be promoted in Lao PDR and Myanmar to reduce the cost of milling. In regard to reduction
in port costs, for example, attraction of private investments in the Port of Yangon can be
complemented by public investments in equipment that allows loads to be covered during the
monsoon season, and lighted buoys and a radar system that would facilitate nighttime sailing
of vessels (LIFT and World Bank 2014).
131. The emerging new task for target countries’ governments is to establish
recognizable rice brands. This is especially important for Cambodia and Lao PDR, the small
exporters who can go for higher-end markets instead of competing on volumes/commodities.
This will help them compete with other exporters and command higher import prices. The



                                                53
private sector alone cannot carry out this task as it needs to be reinforced with a government-
approved certification process and stamp to gain the confidence of importers and distributors.
The brands ideally would combine a unique rice name and a visual portrayal of the country’s
rich cultural heritage. Brand creators for higher-value fragrant rice, for example, may also
consider creation of a protected geographical identification for specific, limited regions in the
country. Such a designation allows marketers to tell a story of why this area is important, how
this rice is produced, and how the designation ensures traceability and standards above the
levels of other areas that produce fragrant rice (IFC 2015).
132. Consistency and reliability are critical to reinforce rice brands, requiring
governments to work with farmers and mills, including through contract farming. Unless
small farmers work with rice mills with the support of agricultural extension and some sort of
matching conditional grants, they will find it very difficult to comply with new, stricter
requirements for quality, safety, and consistency, pointing to another important governmental
role going forward.
133. Establishing rice brands takes time and effort. Cambodia began this process in 2012,
and despite being awarded multiple times at many global rice events for its high-quality rice,
the Cambodian rice brand is not yet fully established. The first brand will be launched in mid-
2016. Lao PDR and Myanmar can learn from Cambodia’s experience.
134. In an era of rising competition on global markets, governments are expected to
play a more active role in market intelligence and promotion campaigns. Market
transparency and reliable information on domestic prices, production, trade, and stocks can
help reduce uncertainty, so governments can initiate establishment of market due diligence
units to collect and disseminate such information. This can be done in partnership with rice
federations and associations. Regarding exports, the target countries are expected to present
the right product to the right market and the more knowledge of market preferences and
opportunities exporters can accrue, the more effective their attempts at market penetration will
be. Governments, together with rice federations, can facilitate learning about foreign market
preferences and restrictions.
135. More can also be done to promote their rice brands. Facilitating personal contacts
of sellers and buyers through trade missions and participation in food trade shows would help.
Rice federations should be expected to distribute various promotional materials through their
websites and to interested visiting potential clients, and these materials need to make buyers
understand the country’s quality standards and certification procedures. Many global
promotional activities can be done at minimal cost, given the ease of online advertising and up-
to-date company, trade, and association websites with direct contact links (IFC 2015).
136. Governments also have a large role to play in improving quality and food safety
management at rice mills. Food safety is important for continued rice exports so it is more
than just a public health issue, it is also a competitiveness issue. Overseas regulators, importers,
and consumers are concerned with biological and chemical contamination of rice, and these
concerns are manifested in produce consignment retentions or rejections, price discounts, and
difficulties in accessing certain market segments. Thus programs that assist rice mills to adopt
the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HAACP) system are to be promoted, in
partnership with the private sector.
137. While better nutrition requires a multisectoral approach, rice can be part of the
solution for improving nutrition. First, higher rice profitability will bring more income to
rice-producing households; yet, farmers rely on better-quality public programs and policies for
that to occur. Second, rice prices cannot be artificially inflated to bring short-run benefits to



                                                54
rice farmers, as consumers will overpay for rice and have less disposable income available to
buy other, more nutritious food. And third, rice value chains themselves can be more nutrition-
sensitive through fortification programs, smart marketing of more nutritious types of rice, and
empowerment of women (by increasing their discretionary agricultural income and reducing
time and labor constraints). Rice will continue to be important for hunger and poverty
reduction, and in this context it can be better utilized to improve nutrition.
138. In the export part of the value chain, large gains can be expected from predictable
and open trade policy, reduction in exporting costs, and trade promotion. Export success
depends on the predictability and openness of export policy, for both cross-border and FOB
trade. The governments in the target countries will not be able to achieve their export targets
when export license commitments are not honored, export is periodically restricted, and
indicative export prices put additional burden on traders. In addition, export would benefit from
lower export costs and trade promotion efforts, which are discussed in the sections above for
mills and trade.
139. The policy shift from rice production to rice value chain facilitation requires many
actions. These actions are in line with the overall shift from production to multidimensional
food agenda promoted in East Asia to enable agriculture to capitalize on new opportunities and
withstand emerging challenges. In the context of falling per capita rice consumption, increasing
competition from other crops, and rising climate change and nutrition-related concerns, the rice
production focus (Figure 24) can be replaced by a multidimensional food policy (Figure 25) to
effectively leverage the rice sector for poverty reduction. Within a new food policy framework,
government attention shifts to agricultural productivity and diversification, value chain
facilitation, food safety and nutrition, and development of the non-farm rural economy (to
create more job opportunities for farm workers increasingly replaced by mechanization to
spend less time on field works and more on non-farm activities).

to apply for better leveraging of their rice value chains for poverty reduction. As presented
in the table, the importance or urgency of various policy instruments varies by country and
many entry points exist for successful public-private partnerships (PPPs). All three target
countries have a large scope for improvement and are advised to use the opportunities identified
in this report to produce results for their countries.

 ANNEX 2: REGIONAL WORKSHOP IN BANGKOK, NOVEMBER 2015
Summary of the Workshop

1.     The cross-country knowledge sharing on rice sector development in GMS and its
leveraging for accelerated poverty reduction started with the regional workshop in
Bangkok on November 10-12, 2015. The workshop was attended by 47 participants. These
included the delegations from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, with the representatives of
the ministries of agriculture, commerce, finance, and private sector. These also included the
representatives of donor organizations (World Bank, IFC, FAO, WFP, and Myanmar’s
Multidonor Trust Fund for Livelihoods for Food Security) and academia and think tanks
(Myanmar Development Research Institute, Kasetsart University of Thailand, Knowledge
Network Institute Thailand, and Thailand Development Research Institute). The World Bank
was represented by the staff of several Global Practices of the World Bank, i.e. Agriculture,
Poverty, Human Development and Nutrition, and Rural, Social and Urban Development.
2.      The first day of the workshop discussed a rice-poverty-nutrition nexus. Sergiy Zorya
(World Bank) introduced the rationale and objectives of the workshop, including the value
added of: (i) sharing cross-country experiences among three low income target countries where
rice sector has a big potential to contribute to poverty alleviation and (ii) using the rich volumes
of existing studies and analyses to develop easy-to-understand story and messages for policy
makers. Then, David Dawe (FAO) presented the framework of links between rice sector and
poverty reduction in three target countries, all net exporters of rice. In these countries, there are
usually more net sellers of rice than buyers among the poor so better price incentives and low
costs for rice production and marketing help generate growth and reduce poverty. Such a
growth also triggers shared prosperity as the recent Cambodian experience has shown.
3.      Next presentations focused on the country specific experiences in rice and poverty
reduction. Sergiy Zorya (World Bank) presented the case of Cambodia where higher rice
prices in 2008 triggered the substantial increase in rice production and, consequently,
agricultural wages. These factors explained more than 60 percent of reduction in poverty
between 2004 and 2011. Economic growth was very inclusive, including due to solid
agricultural growth (5.3 percent annually), resulting in the higher growth of the income of 40
percent of the lowest income quantile people compared to other 60 percent (shared prosperity).
Obert Pimhidzai (World Bank) presented the experiences from Lao PDR, where rice sector
also did the large contribution to poverty reduction but failed to produce similar large effects
for twin goas as in Cambodia. The poverty reduction from 2008 to 2013 was modest and the
growth was not inclusive. Min Ye Paing Hein (World Bank) presented the case of Myanmar
where information is still limited but it shows that poor performance of the rice sector has been
among the key reasons of high poverty in the country. The rice-poverty session was closed by
Christopher Jackson (World Bank), who presented the experiences from Vietnam. In 1990s,
the growth in rice production and productivity and consequently exports made significant
contribution to poverty reduction in that country. At current stage of the country’s
development, further contributions from rice to poverty reduction is expected not so much from
the increase in rice productivity but from improved quality of rice, liberalization of rice export
arrangements, and removing the restrictions on land use to allow farmers produce other crops
where it is more profitable than rice.
4.      The final session of the first day focused on linking rice and poverty reduction with
nutrition. Sergiy Zorya (World Bank) presented the current situation of high malnutrition,
especially stunting among children, in the target countries and the framework for leveraging
rice for better nutrition, in addition to converting higher income from selling rice into better


                                                 63
nutritional outcomes. In principle, actions can be taken at various stages of the rice value chain
to improve nutritional rice sensitivity. These include biofortification of seeds, crop
diversification/rotations at farm level, rice fortification by mills, and awareness creation about
higher nutritious values of brown and parboiled rice over ordinary, well-polished rice largely
consumed in Asia. Rice fortification is an emerging promising solution to increase nutritious
value of rice, and Rizwan Yusufali (WFP) presented opportunities offered by this technology.
Yet, he also stressed out many implementation challenges, which result in the non-adoption of
scaled up rice fortification in Asia beyond few pilots in Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines.
5.      The second day of the workshop was devoted to the current situation and outlook
for rice value chain developments in the target countries. The key questions are the
preparedness of rice value chains to give their best to achieve twin goals and the understanding
of the main gaps in three target countries compared to more developed Thailand and Vietnam.
Bas Rozemuller and Sarak Duong (IFC) presented the key features of rice value chains in
Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. Sergiy Zorya (World Bank) and David Dawe (FAO)
presented the comparative analysis of rice value chain indicators in GMS that measure
competitiveness and vulnerabilities at various stages of rice value chains (input supply,
production, milling, exports, and consumer vulnerabilities). These indicators were developed
by the group of rice experts under the current project, with the focus on the limited number of
easy to understand and measurable indicators, with the data for 2013/14 in main production
areas in each country.
6.      The second part of the second day was devoted to rice market outlook. All three
target countries are already net exporters of rice, even Lao PDR, and all three countries seek to
increase productivity and production. Therefore, they also need markets for anticipated
surpluses. The session started with the presentation from Larry Wong (Consultant), who
discussed the medium-term outlook for the global rice market and opportunities and challenges
for Cambodia and Myanmar. Global demand for rice is projected to increase in the next 15
years but at lower pace than in the past due to the declining per capita rice consumption in Asia.
Growing markets are in Africa and Middle East, which our target countries would need to
penetrate into, in addition to the traditional markets in Asia and in the EU. Premium is also
increasingly paid for higher quality and safety, putting pressures to move from low value
commodity approach practiced by Myanmar, for example, to high quality differentiated rice
types. This was followed by three presentations on cross-border trade, made by Munichan
Kung (World Bank) for Cambodia, Larry Wong (Consultant) for Myanmar, and Sergiy Zorya
(World Bank) for Lao PDR. Cross-border trade has been and will continue to be important for
the target countries so a stronger regional integration is necessary to pursue to guarantee
markets for their rice exports.
7.      The third day of the workshop discussed the role of rice sector in overall
agricultural and food policy. Rice will remain important in policy considerations in all target
countries but it is not the only sector with growth opportunities. Other crops are often more
profitable than rice, especially in dry season. Urbanized population demands variety of food,
including higher quality and safer rice. Monoculture paddy production tends to emit a lot of
CO2 and lead to other environmental problems such as water overuse, soil degradation, and
pollution caused by high use of fertilizers and chemicals. And rice has low nutrition values.
Thus, agricultural and food policy in the target countries would need to shift from rice
production centered approach to multidimensional approach that includes the aspects of
agricultural productivity and diversification, sustainable supply chains, nutritional security and
food safety, and non-farm economy and employment. Going forward it implies “yes” to
programs that raise rice sector competitiveness, profitability, and environmental sustainability,
and “no” to programs that crowd out or ignore other crops such as land restrictions for rice


                                               64
production, rice price support and input subsidies, subsidized credit for rice producers, under-
financing of other public programs (research, extension, seeds, soil nutrient management, food
safety, etc.), and rice-focused irrigation systems.
8.      The workshop’s participants have in general endorsed the above messages and
points. The feedback from the workshop’s participants was extremely positive. They said to
highly value the following: (i) simulation of public debate on important policy issues; (ii) the
exposure to cross-country experiences and best practices, and a large variety of very relevant
topics; (iii) clear and informative power point presentations that can be used in the future for
many purposes; (iv) access to the library of useful reports; (v) opportunities to network with
colleagues from neighboring countries and development partners; and (vi) opportunities to
share and compare views of private and public sectors.
9.       The country participants asked for similar in-country events, with the several first
ones already identified. The Laos delegation asked to learn more about Cambodian
experiences and seed sector development more broadly in the region and around the globe. The
delegates from Cambodia asked to make a deeper dive in regional competitiveness issues,
including evolving trends in export competitiveness of Myanmar and Vietnam. The Myanmar
delegation discussed the need to learn more about rice reserves and addressing its rice
competitiveness issues. The World Bank and IFC will follow up on these requests to continue
facilitating the cross-country knowledge and experience sharing as envisaged under this
regional task.

         ANNEX 3: WORKSHOP IN VIENTIANE, NOVEMBER 2015
Summary of the Workshop

1.      The November 17, 2015 workshop focused on learning from the experiences of rice
sector development in Cambodia to inform the implementation of the rice development
strategy in Lao PDR. The specific focus was on the role of private sector in rice value chain.
The workshop was organized jointly by Agriculture GP of the World Bank and the IFC as a
part of the regional policy dialogue on leveraging the rice sector development for accelerated
poverty reduction in GMS. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Xaypladeth Choulamany, Director
General of Department of Planning and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
(MAF). Other participants (30 in total) included the representatives of MAF, Ministry of
Industry and Commerce, Chamber of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, Khammouane and
Champassak Provincial Governments, and rice millers. The meeting was also attended by the
head of the IFC office in Vientiane and the representatives of FAO and WFP.
2.     The knowledge transfer was made through presentations and discussions . Sergiy
Zorya (World Bank) discussed the last decade’s development of rice sector in Cambodia. Bas
Rozemuller and Sarak Duong (IFC) presented the lessons learned from the IFC Rice Sector
Support Project in Cambodia. Puthyvuth Sok, President of CRF, presented the private sector
perspectives on Cambodian rice sector development.
3.       The first presentation discussed the significant contribution the rice sector has
made to growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Cambodia in the last decade.
It also emphasized the big role the markets and exports played in releasing the paddy surpluses
resulted from the increase in production. While the success of Cambodian rice sector is often
associated with the sharp increase in formal rice exports, especially to the EU, another salient
feature of success is the rise in cross-border trade with Vietnam and Thailand, mainly with
paddy. The traders from these neighboring countries often pay higher price for paddy than
Cambodian mills, so Cambodian farmers greatly benefit from open trade policy. These are
important lessons for Lao PDR, who has only recently begun to appreciate the role of markets
and value chains in rice sector, and the need to promote cross-border trade for successful
growth in paddy production.
4.      The presentation of the IFC project focused on activities and achievements. The
project includes three components: (i) improving paddy quality; (ii) improving milling
efficiency; and (iii) promoting rice exports. On component 1, the project works with the
selected mills to engage them in seed multiplication for fragrant rice seed varieties, develop
radio programs to educate farmers on importance of good seeds, and develop the innovative
interactive voice response system for questions related to seeds. On component 2, the project
helps improve efficiency and quality through rice mill management software, advice on milling
operation and equipment, and food safety certification. On component 3, the project builds
capacity of rice exporters and CRF, help identify new export markets in addition to the EU,
and develop and promote Cambodian rice brand. The project is proud for making the rice mills
sector more competitive and Cambodian rice more known around the world as it was
recognized as the best world rice three years in a row from 2012 to 2014. The important lessons
learned for Lao PDR are: (i) the need to explore the pluralism in delivering extension services
and seed sector development; (ii) the importance to pay attention to quality, not only quantity
of rice; (iii) the need to provide technical assistance to rice mills to make them stronger and
incentivize the closer contacts with farmers; and (iv) the importance of marketing promotion
to find new outlets for Lao rice.

5.      The President of the CRF discussed the important role of the rice federation to
play in strengthening rice value chain working together with the government, in addition
to presenting the recent developments in the sector and challenges going forward.
6.      The participants thanked the World Bank and the IFC for facilitating the
exchange of best practices and information sharing with Cambodia. They learned about
many similar challenges for the rice sector development in Cambodia, but the importance given
to the development of private sector there. The discussion centered on the issues related to
development of rice mills and what the public sector can do to make them stronger, how to
promote a country rice brand, on the role of the rice federation and how to establish a similar
federation in Lao PDR, the roles the private sector can play in seeds sector development, and
how to create incentives for rice mills to work closer with small farmers.
7.      The workshop created the awareness among Lao stakeholders about experiences
in the neighboring country and the important role of private sector in strengthening of
rice value chains, and stimulated policy debate. It also helped establish the contacts of MAF
and other Lao stakeholders with CRF for follow up discussions, experience sharing, and visits.

       ANNEX 4: WORKSHOP IN PHNOM PENH, DECEMBER 2015
Summary of the Workshop

1.      The Roundtable Discussion, which was held on December 1, 2015, focused on
competitiveness pressures to the rice sector in Cambodia, including pressures from
Myanmar and Vietnam. The meeting was organized jointly by Trade and Competitiveness
GP and Agriculture GP as a part of the country policy dialogue and also the broader regional
policy dialogue on leveraging the rice sector development for accelerated poverty reduction in
GMS. The participants included the President of the CRF and the CRF members, rice traders
and millers.
2.       The participants first discussed the state of logistics in the rice value chain in
Cambodia, triggered by the presentation made by Julian Clarke (World Bank) . They
largely agreed with the Bank diagnostic of the major issues and solutions. They confirmed that
the cross-country cost breakdown in rice value chain is a simple and powerful way to
benchmark competitiveness. High costs of transportation on roads in Cambodia compared to
Thailand and Vietnam, due to the poor quality of roads, 30 ton limits for truck loads (compared
to 60 tons in Thailand), aged trucking fleet (mainly due to the high cost of financing for the
trucking industry), and the lack of alternatives, e.g. rail and water, is one big issue. Another
issue is the long and costly procedures in the Sihanoukville port. The port also has infrastructure
bottlenecks: it can service only small vessels, up to 20,000 tons, which are more expensive to
use for transportation than the lager ocean vessels. The use of containers instead of bulk for
rice transportation also adds to the costs, yet bulk transportation requires cheap transport
system (e.g. rail) and large quantities of rice, which are missing in Cambodia. The use of the
HCMC port for transit of Cambodian rice to overseas destinations is the expensive proposition:
it costs $120/container from Sihanoukville to HCMC while only $30/container from HCMC to
the EU ports. It was agreed that investments are urgently needed to remove these logistics
bottlenecks to increase the competitiveness of Cambodian rice.
3.      During the second half of the roundtable, participants discussed various threats
posed by regional competitors, following the presentation made by Sergiy Zorya (World
Bank). Myanmar is an emerging rice exporter. It exported 0.5 million tons of rice in 2010/11,
increasing the export volumes to 1.3 million tons in 2012/13 and 1.8 million tons in 2014/15.
Most exports from Myanmar go to China through cross-border trade, but Myanmar has also
increased its exports to the EU under the EBA that provides duty-free and quota free access to
the EU market for Least Developed Countries. Until recently, Cambodia was the largest
exporter of rice under the EBA – 91 percent in 2012/13. But by 2013/14, its share had dropped
to 63 percent while Myanmar increased its exports, accounting for 35 percent of total EBA
exports. Myanmar’s increased exports under the EBA does not pose an immediate
competitiveness threat to Cambodia due to the different varieties of rice exported by each
country: Cambodia sells mainly fragrant and low broken ordinary rice (less than 5 percent
brokens) for direct human consumption while Myanmar’s main rice exported to the EU has
been the high broken ordinary rice (with 25 percent and more brokens), often added to cereal
products and pet food. In the longer run, however, Cambodia would need to take the
competition from Myanmar seriously as the latter can eventually improve the quality of its rice
and thus directly compete with Cambodian rice.
4.      In addition to Myanmar, participants discussed the impact of the recent regional
trade agreements on Cambodian rice sector. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is unlikely
to affect Cambodia, and in general non-TPP countries’ rice exports. Large TPP-members rice
importers, such as Japan and Malaysia, have not committed to removing their high import


                                                72
tariffs for rice, with Japan only committing to increase the tariff rate quota for Australia and
the USA. The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, on the other hand, will affect Cambodia
and the net effect may is likely to be negative unless Cambodia improves its competitiveness.
The EU offers the time bound tariff rate quota for Vietnam rice, with fully liberalized trade in
2020. Vietnam has increasingly exported aromatic/fragrant rice at lower prices than Cambodia.
In 2013/14, the average FOB price of fragrant rice in Vietnam was $507/ton compared to $850
in Cambodia. It can therefore replace Cambodian rice in the EU unless Cambodia strengthens
the marketing links with the EU buyers, keeps improving quality and reducing the costs of its
rice, and removing inefficiencies and high costs in its rice value chain.
5.      The participants then discussed the CRF vision on priority areas to strengthen the
rice value chain in Cambodia, based on the presentation made by Puthyvuth Sok,
President of CRF. They include: (i) lack of good quality seeds; (ii) lack of storage facilities
and dryers; and (iii) lack of access to affordable working capital and long-term finance and
access to markets. The participants shared experiences on seed sector development and what
can be done to improve access to finance. The establishment of warehouse receipt system was
discussed based on the earlier analytical input provided by the Bank and IFC on this topic.
6.      It was agreed to continue this kind of experience sharing events and the overall
involvement of the private sector, including CRF, in the preparation of recommendations
to the government on rice sector development by the WBG. The participants have provided
the positive feedback on the WBG contribution to the development of rice sector, including the
IFC rice project, and they asked the WBG to stay involved in this sector due to its importance
to growth and poverty reduction in the country.

           ANNEX 5: WORKSHOP IN YANGON, JANUARY 2016
Summary of the Workshop

1.     The workshop, which was held on January 15, 2016 in Yangon, Myanmar,
gathered 32 participants to discuss the rice sector development and competitiveness
pressures in Myanmar. The meeting was organized by the Livelihoods and Food Security
Multidonor Trust Fun (LIFT), as a part of the joint analytical and policy dialogue program with
the Word Bank. The participants included the rice sector experts, think tanks, academia, and
development partners.
2.     The workshop was opened by Andrew Kirkwood, Director of the LIFT, describing
the partnership with the World Bank that among other things, promotes knowledge
generation on rice sector development in Myanmar. The opening remarks were followed
by the presentation made by Sergiy Zorya (World Bank). The presentation was based on the
analysis of farm production economics in selected regions of Myanmar and cross-country
comparisons using the work under the GMS Rice Policy Dialogue. The key messages of the
presentation are presented below:
           a. Most farmers in Myanmar produce paddy during monsoon season but switch to
              other crops during cool and dry seasons.
           b. In international comparison the rice sector productivity and overall agricultural
              productivity in Myanmar is low, irrespective of what indicators are used. It
              limits the sector’s contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
           c. Low productivity is a result of multiple factors, many of them associated with
              the undersupply of quality public services such as research, extension, and rural
              infrastructure, in delivery of which the government has a key role to play.
           d. Going forward and given that paddy is less profitable and more costly to
              produce than other crops, especially during the cool and dry seasons, it is
              desirable to redesign public programs from high support for paddy production
              to support for a broad-based agricultural development
3.     During the Q&A session, the participants discussed policy implications of the
above findings. Main policy implications were agreed to be the following:
           a. Low productivity and profitability are a result of undersupply of public goods
           b. More funds to be allocated to seed, extension, quality controls, and research
           c. Public programs need to go beyond paddy/rice
           d. Irrigation needs attention as it does not bring high rates of return
           e. Farmers must have freedom of production decisions, including farmland
              classification
           f. The gap with other counties is large so right investments in agriculture will bring
              high rates of return
4.      It was agreed to continue this kind of workshops. The participants have provided the
positive feedback on the World Bank contribution to fill knowledge gaps about rice sector in
Myanmar and asked the World Bank to stay involved in this sector due to its importance to
growth and poverty reduction in the country.
