                                               Summary

Despite strong economic growth over the past decade, large inequities persist in Dominican society and are
declining more slowly than expected. GDP per capita rose almost 50 percent from 2000 to 2011, yet many of the
country’s 10 million people missed out on the benefits. Moderate poverty has fallen by only half of the dramatic
spike that followed the decade’s only growth setback, a 2003-2004 economic crisis. Chronic poverty—in which
people endure long spells of being poor—remains high. Of greater concern, almost one third of the population
is poor despite having the skills and assets to generate higher income.


The Dominican Republic also has low economic mobility, with less than 2 percent of its people climbing to a
higher income group during the decade, compared to an average 41 percent in the Latin America and Caribbean
region as a whole. Despite improving access to basic goods and services such as water and education, coverage
and quality remain uneven, thus limiting the economic opportunities of many disadvantaged people. This re-
flects their inability to influence the system to their benefit, a manifestation of weak political agency.


This report identifies three broad goals for addressing the underlying causes of economic inequity in the Domin-
ican Republic.


1. Promote equitable, efficient and sustainable fiscal policy,


2. Build fair, transparent and efficient institutions that will improve the provision and quality of public goods and
services, expand economic opportunities, increase upward mobility and better protect economically vulnerable
Dominicans, and


3. Strengthen access of the poor to labor markets and increase the demand for their labor, so as to make efficient
use of human capital and allow the poor to benefit from economic growth.

Note: The numbers in Panel A cover the period 2000-2011 for the Dominican Republic and circa 1995-2010 for LAC. Indicators of economic mobility (“sliders,” “climbers” and
“stayers”) are measured in percentages on the left-hand Y-axis. “Middle class” consists of individuals with a per capita income per day higher than $10 in LAC and $9 and $7.35 in
the Dominican Republic for urban and rural households, respectively. Both values are expressed in 2005 $ purchasing power parity (PPP).

2. Build fair, transparent and efficient institutions that will
improve the provision and quality of public goods and

from economic shocks and

3. Strengthen access of the poor to labor markets and in-

use of human capital and allow the poor to benefit from
economic growth.

                                 The effect of economic growth and income redistribution on poverty can only be measured correctly if a country has well-defined methodologies
                                 for the construction of welfare aggregate and poverty lines. Before 2012, the Dominican Republic lacked these, relying instead on multiple poverty
                                 estimates that were computed by international institutions such as the World Bank, the IADB and ECLAC based on international poverty lines.
                                 Consequently, the Government gathered a team of experts on poverty measurement from different institutions, including The World Bank, in order to
                                 devise official methodologies for poverty calculations. The committee agreed on several technical and theoretical points such as the most appropriate
                                 welfare income and its components; the conformation and estimation of the basic bundle of needs including a food basket for extreme poverty; and
                                 current expenditure for the estimation of the Engel coefficient used in moderate poverty. The committee also agreed on the best way to calculate
                                 the monetary value of poverty lines, the frequency of updates and the years of comparability over time. On July 31, 2012, the Dominican Republic

                                Box 2: A profile of the Haitian immigrants

                                In 2012, the Dominican Republic’s National Statistics Office (ONE) performed the nation’s first survey specifically targeted at the nation’s immigrant
                                population. The Encuesta Nacional de Inmigrantes (ENI-2012) found many differences between native Dominicans and immigrants, who account
                                for 7.9 percent of the Dominican Republic’s population. Furthermore, household and demographic differences between Haitian immigrants, who
                                account for 87.3 percent of the Dominican Republic’s immigrant population (excluding descendants), and immigrants from other nations were found.

                                While the majority of immigrants live in urban areas (68.2 percent), Haitian immigrants are more likely to live in rural areas than the rest of the
                                immigrant population (34.9 percent compared to 10.4 percent). Furthermore, average household size is slightly lower for Haitian immigrants (2.3)
                                than non-Haitian immigrants (2.7). Consistent with a higher likelihood of Haitian immigrant households having a male head (83.1 percent compared
                                to 77.9 percent of non-Haitian immigrant households), the share of males in the Haitian immigrant population is larger (65.4 percent) than among
                                non-Haitian immigrants (57.5 percent).

                                There are also large differences in terms of access to certain basic services and important personal documentation (see Figure 32). Immigrants from
                                countries other than Haiti are more likely to be literate, have access to utilities and health insurance and to possess documents such as passports,
                                birth certificates and national ID cards. Although first-generation Dominicans are more likely to be literate and have access to electricity than
                                Haitian immigrants, they are less likely to have documentation. This creates problems with access to financial institutions and services since this
                                documentation is required by many providers.

                                The primary reason which led people to migrate to the Dominican Republic was to find work (45.2 percent).18 Thus, it is not surprising that, in
                                comparison to the native Dominican population, immigrants are much more likely to be of working age. There are also differences in the types
                                of work performed by Haitian and non-Haitian immigrants (see Figure 26). While the majority of Haitian immigrants work in agriculture or
                                construction, the majority of immigrants from other countries work in business and other services.

                                The contrasts between these two immigrant groups may be partially explained by differences in their levels of educational attainment (see Figure
                                27). While over three quarters of other immigrants have completed their secondary education with 46.9 percent having completed their tertiary
                                education, only 21.6 percent of Haitian immigrants have completed secondary education and less than 6 percent have completed tertiary education.
                                Though more likely than Haitian immigrants to complete primary school, first-generation Dominicans also lag behind on educational attainment,
                                with only 24 percent finishing secondary school.

                                Many immigrants do not plan to remain in the Dominican Republic but intend to return to their home country or to move on to another country. Less
                                than half (47.5 percent) of immigrants plan on staying in the Dominican Republic for the next five years, and the percentage of Haitians planning on
                                returning to their home country is 8.1 percent higher than immigrants from other countries.

Note: Anonymous growth incidence curves (GICs) are shown in solid lines and non-anonymous GICc in dotted lines. For non-anonymous GICs, rst-round incomes are the actual incomes reported
in the survey and second-round incomes correspond to lower-bound estimates using the Dang et al. (2011) technique. For anonymous GICs, rst- and second-round incomes are based on the
cross-sectional nature of the ENFT. Left and right vertical lines show the proportion of poor and vulnerable people in 2004 (Panel A) and 2011 (Panel B). The X-axis shows deciles of income per     49
capita. Source: Study team’s own estimates based on ENFT 2000–2011

Households that are today in the middle or well off class-

poverty or vulnerability. Heads of households that be-

Note: “Educational gap” is de ned as the di erence between potential years of education at age 15 and the years of completed education circa 1995 and circa 2009. The blue
and red bars represent the expected reduction in the schooling gap associated with one standard deviation in parental education in 1995 and 2009, respectively. The green bar
is the di erence between the two. Other covariates in the regression are children’s gender, residence in an urban area and country xed e ects. The estimated e ect of parental
education on the educational gap is always statistically signi cantly di erent from zero as are the di erences between 1995 and 1999.

                                 Box 3: Teenage pregnancy as a proxy of agency in the Dominican Republic

                                 Agency, or the freedom to pursue processes by which individuals achieve socioeconomic advancement, is a fundamental aspect of equity (Cord and
                                 Lopez-Calva 2013). Agency entails that people have the social, economic and political means to pursue life options that they have reasons to value.
                                 In other words, agency is the ability of people, regardless of background, to make decisions and convert them into desired actions and outcomes.
                                 The constitutive elements of agency are: (1) individual aspects, including objective conditions (e.g. good health or lack of it) and subjective elements
                                 (aspirations and self-drive); (2) contextual elements, such as social norms, culture and formal institutions; and (3) power, defined as the capacity
                                 to align the actions of others to one’s own interest (Cord and Lopez-Calva 2013). Agency involves many aspects of life, whether it is ability to rise in
                                 the workplace, have political voice, or take control of personal health and family decisions. One possible manifestation of lack of agency is teenage
                                 pregnancy.

                                 The adolescent fertility rate (AFR) is defined as the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-19. In the LAC region, the AFR decreased between
                                 2000 and 2010 for all countries considered. Yet, the numbers for the Dominican Republic are not encouraging—the country had the second-highest
                                 AFR (after Nicaragua) among 21 countries. Indeed, during this period, the Dominican Republic also had the lowest reduction of AFR, only -4 percent.
                                 By contrast, Colombia achieved the highest reduction of AFR in the region,-25 percent.27

                                 The adolescent fertility rate for the Dominican Republic is remarkably higher than in otherwise comparable countries. For instance, countries
                                 with similar GDP per capita such as Ecuador, Peru and Jamaica have AFRs which are two thirds lower than the Dominican Republic’s. In the case of
                                 countries with similar extreme poverty rates ($2.50 a day poverty line), the AFR of the Dominican Republic is again quite higher than theirs. For
                                 example, the extreme poverty rates in 2009 for Brazil and the Dominican Republic were 15.1 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. However, the
                                 AFR for Brazil was 75.8 whereas it was 105.65 for the Dominican Republic, almost 40 percent higher than the Dominican Republic. Finally, using the
                                 Gini coefficient as a point of reference, the Dominican Republic is once again way higher than its counterparts such as Ecuador and Peru on the AFR.
                                 However, the Dominican Republic is not alone in this regard—Nicaragua and Guatemala, countries with high AFRs as well, are also quite far from
                                 their own comparable countries in terms of inequality.

Correlations in school attainment across generations in-
dicate that LAC is the least educationally mobile region
in the world (Hertz et al. 2007). The high persistence of
educational attainment is also evident in the Dominican
Republic. The association between parental background
and the educational gap of children at age 15 (the differ-
ence between potential years of education at that age
and the actual years of education completed) shows that
the gap is larger among children raised in households
with lower parental background, be it fewer years of edu-
cation or lower income. In 2009, an increase of a standard
deviation in parental education among households in the
Dominican Republic reduces the schooling gap by nearly
0.74 years of education, to bring it close to the LAC region
average. Even though the impact on children of extra pa-
rental education was higher in 1995 (0.87 year of educa-
tion), suggesting that educational persistence has fallen,
the reduction was small. Another factor that further limits
equality of opportunity and mobility across generations
is the fact that not only do children of more educated par-
ents complete more years of education, there are also sub-
stantial differences in the quality of schooling that they
receive. In fact, analyses, controlling for potential biases,
of the relationship between parental background and the
performance of students in standardized test scores show
that children who have parents with tertiary education
do substantially better than children with parents who
attained only primary education (World Bank 2013).

as financial services, transportation and communications
and tourism) that have either little employment creation
or low-paying jobs.

To address these issues, this study identifies three poli-
cy actions to address the underlying factors of inequity.
These include: (1) adjusting the structure of fiscal policy,
both on the expenditure and revenue sides, to make it
more equitable, efficient and sustainable; (2) developing
and strengthening monitoring, social accountability and
incentive mechanisms to increase the quality and provi-
sion of public goods; and (3) strengthening the access of
the poor and other disadvantaged groups to labor mar-
kets and increasing the demand for their labor to make
efficient use of human capital, allowing the poor to maxi-
mize returns on their endowments and to ultimately ben-
efit from economic growth.

Finally, policy design aimed at promoting a more bal-
anced development path could be effectively informed
by further analytical work. Particularly salient work could
be performed in the areas of fiscal policy, social sectors
and labor markets. This would help to further uncover the
underlying factors that inhibit the gains of growth from
being more evenly shared across the population. A rele-
vant concern in this analysis is discrepancies between the
Dominican Republic’s national accounts and household
survey data. Serious analytical efforts should be devoted
to understanding the apparent disconnection between
macro and micro data that hinders the ability of national
statistics to accurately reflect macroeconomic and social
progress.
