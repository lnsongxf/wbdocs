Established in 2009, the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) aims to increase regional cooperation in the management
of the major Himalayan river systems in South Asia to deliver sustainable, fair and inclusive development and climate
resilience. It is designed to support countries improve and deepen transboundary dialogue, enhance the basin and
water resources knowledge base, strengthen water institutions, and support investments that lead to reducing extreme
poverty and promoting shared economic development. SAWI is a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World
Bank on behalf of the governments of United Kingdom, Australia and Norway and supports activities related to the
management of the Greater Himalayas transboundary water systems in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China,
India, Nepal and Pakistan. SAWI’s program is built around the theme of knowledge, dialogue, cooperation; the
region’s three shared river basins – the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus rivers; and the Sundarbans landscape.
