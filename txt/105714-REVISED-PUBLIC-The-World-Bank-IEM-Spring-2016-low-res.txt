however, has been battered by the disruptive
impact of the sanctions but also by longstanding
distortive policies including directed lending
schemes and effective interest rate ceilings amid
high inflation. Our second Special Focus reviews
the structure of Iran’s banking and financial sector,
the implications of the lifting of the sanctions, and
outlines key structural reforms areas. While the
lifting of the sanctions will provide much needed
breathing space to the financial sector, in and by
themselves, they can only deliver moderate gains
in terms of growth and jobs; only when coupled
with essential structural reforms can Iran be
expected to reach the growth target of its sixth five-
year plan. Structural reforms include improving the
independence and effectiveness of the CBI to fulfill
its monetary policy, and banking regulatory and
supervisory mandates.

                                      Box 1. Macroeconomic impact of the partial lifting of sanctions under the JPOA in 2013.

 In late 2013, the Iranian economy began benefitting from sound policymaking along with the partial lifting of sanctions
 through the JPOA. The new administration elected in July 2013 made improving the economy its key priority and implemented
 a number of initiatives including, most notably: (i) the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies leading to a marked decline in
 inflationary pressures on the economy; (ii) the setting of key lending rates in relation to the inflation rate, leading to positive real
 interest rates; (iii) the expansion in the availability of credit through the reduction of non-performing loans relative to total loans
 through the establishment of a committee within the Central Bank of Iran tasked with monitoring these loans and the adoption
 of legislation to impose penalties on defaulting borrowers; (iv) the reduction in credit risk through the establishment of a credit
 bureau; and (v) the signing of the JPOA between Iran and the P5+1 which allowed the partial lifting of sanctions on Iran and which
 offered prospects for the full lifting of sanctions on the economy.

 The economy recorded a modest improvement in the first quarter of 2014 following the lifting of sanctions and began
 accelerating in the second quarter. In the quarter following the partial sanctions relief under the JPOA (2013Q4, according to
 the Iranian calendar year), lower trade costs led to an increase in exports of 14 percent while imports grew by 4 percent year-on
 year (Figure 2). This momentum was, however, insufficient to pull the economy out of recession, thereby leading to a year-over-
 year contraction of 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 2013. This appears to have been driven by a moderate response of oil GDP
 growth to the lifting of sanctions and a slow response of non-oil GDP (Figure 3). In each of the first two quarters of 2014—i.e.,
 the two quarters following the partial lifting of sanctions—the economy expanded by 3.8 percent year-over-year supported by an
 increase in oil value-added by 7.3 percent and 10.4 percent year-over-year in the first and second quarter of 2014, respectively,
 while the non-oil segment of the economy rose by 3.4 percent and 3.2 percent year-over-year in the first and second quarter of
 2014, respectively.

 Inflation eased as the Central Bank of Iran adopted a less accommodative monetary policy stance and as supply constraints
 abated. CPI inflation dropped to 24 percent y-o-y in 2013Q4—i.e., the quarter following the lifting of sanctions—from 33 percent
 in the previous quarter (Figure 4). This came as the central bank reduced the growth of the monetary base. The lifting of sanctions
 also reinforced the slowdown in the depreciation of the exchange rate (as the new government strived to improve macroeconomic
 conditions following the presidential elections in 2013Q2). The gap between the official and the parallel exchange rate has also
 narrowed (see Monetary and Financial Sector Section).

                                  Box 2. How precise and reliable are official GDP estimates?

  Existing estimates suggest that Iran’s unrecorded GDP in the early and mid-2000s was lower than the regional average.
  Taiebnia and Mohammadi (2008) estimate the size of the underground economy in Iran to be close to 20 percent of GDP.
  Schneider (2005) estimates the level of unrecorded GDP for a sample of 110 countries.* He finds that in 2000, unrecorded GDP
  in Iran was 18.9 percent of official GDP, compared to 19.4 percent of GDP in Jordan, 32.1 percent Turkey, 35.1 percent of GDP
  in Egypt and 36.4 percent of GDP in Morocco.** More recently, Schneider, Buehn and Montenegro (2010) find that the size of
  the shadow economy in Iran was equivalent to 17.4 percent of GDP in 2006, compared to 17.7 percent of GDP in Jordan, 29.5
  percent of GDP in Turkey, 32.8 percent of GDP in Egypt and 34.8 percent of GDP in Morocco.

  The extent of misreporting of economic activities may have increased in recent years as a result of the intensification of
  sanctions imposed on Iran. A deterioration in the exhaustiveness and quality of trade reporting, for instance, will undermine the
  accuracy of official GDP measurement. This has arguably been the case of imports from Iran. To illustrate, starting in 2012, 12.7
  percent of reported world imports from Iran have no assigned commodity classification, compared to only 0.04 percent and 0.01
  percent of goods in 2010 and 2011, respectively (Figure 8). As such, the value of goods traded may have also been misreported.
  Mirror trade data, however, indicate the reporting of 95 percent of these transactions by Turkey and much of the remainder by
  Afghanistan. Given that both of these countries share common borders with Iran, these products could be re-exported to other
  countries. These transactions appear at about the time that oil and other mineral fuel imports drop sharply.

*Schneider (2005) uses the DYMIMIC (Dynamic Multiple-Indicators Multiple-Causes) model which considers multiple causes and
multiple indicators of the phenomenon to be measured and uses a factor-analytic approach to measure the hidden economy as an
unobserved variable over time.

              According to the 2011 Census, unemployment is much more prevalent among the more educated youth population in Iran.
              For young men, unemployment was particularly high among university graduates (35 percent), youth with graduate studies (30
              percent) and high school graduates (29 percent), and less prominent among youth with some college education (26 percent). For
              young women, the unemployment rate remained high across all levels of educational attainment (Figure 10).

              New entrants to the labor market faced difficulties landing their first job and remained unemployed for a lengthy period
              of time due to weak economic growth and rigid labor market policies. Egel and Salehi-Isfahani (2010) find that youth who
              did not find a job immediately after graduation remained unemployed for a period of three years on average. This was largely
              explained by the weak pace of economic growth as well as rigid labor market conditions—most particularly related to severance
              payment—that tend to protect tenured workers. This is illustrated in Figure 11 which compares the severance payments to be paid
              to a redundant worker in Iran and Malaysia. In Malaysia, a firm would be required to pay the equivalent of two months of salary to
              dismiss a redundant worker with five years of tenure, while in Iran a firm would be required to pay the equivalent of a little over
              five months of salary (Figure 11). Furthermore, the gap between the two countries was found to increase with the length of tenure.

              Despite considerable gains in the educational attainment level in recent decades, the educational system is not providing
              youth with the skills needed to become employed and to be productive in their jobs. There is a dissociation between the
              knowledge and skills acquired by students in the educational system and the requirements of the labor market. Pedagogical
              methods emphasize memorization over the acquisition of problem solving skills that enhance productivity. As such, in spite of the
              high level of educational attainment reached by many Iranians today, the quality of the education received remains inadequate.
              Private sector employers are understandably reluctant to hire young graduate workers at the prevailing wages for their educational
              attainment level without obtaining additional information about their skills and potential productivity. Finally, students’ choice
              of field of study often does not take into consideration their likelihood of becoming employed, but rather target high paying jobs
              which also have high unemployment rates associated with them.

                                         Box 4. Oil wealth in Iran: allocation and savings management.

 Between 2011 and 2015, 63.5 percent of projected oil and gas revenue (in excess of the 14.5 percent retained by the National
 Iranian Oil Company, NIOC) were transferred to the budget, with the share mandated to decrease by 3 percentage points per year
 until 2015. The remaining revenues were dedicated to deprived and oil-producing regions (2 percent of projected revenue) and
 Iran’s oil wealth management funds, i.e., the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) and the National Development Fund (NDF). These two
 funds play different, but complementary roles of budget stabilization and national development, respectively.
 The Oil Stabilization Fund was established in 2000 under the third five-year development plan. The objective of the OSF was to
 serve as a budget stabilization mechanism to insulate the budget from fluctuations in oil revenues and to generate returns on
 the investment. Until the creation of the NDF, it also played the role of a domestic private sector development fund to support
 economic diversification. The OSF is legislated to receive all oil and gas export revenue in excess of the revenue projected in the
 annual budget law and the 14.5 percent revenues retained by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The OSF also maintains
 a stock of funds but the allocation of these funds across capital injections, the NDF and for budget financing remains currently
 unclear. As of early 2016, no assets are left in the OSF and the 2016 budget does not envisage a role for the fund any more.

 The National Development Fund was established under the fifth five-year development plan to undertake the OSF’s role as a
 domestic development fund to promote exports, investments and FDI ventures, as well as to support greater intergenerational
 equity of natural resource wealth. The NDF had US$62 billion of assets under management in 2014. As of early 2016, the total
 value of assets under management is unclear, partly because a large share of these assets where lent to the domestic private sector
 (e.g., SMEs) during the sanctions period—as access to finance was difficult; these likely have become non-performing, for reasons
 similar to the large non-performing loan portfolio that Iran’s banking system is grappling with. In 2011, 20 percent of projected
 oil and gas export revenue was allocated to the NDF, with this share legislated to increase by 3 pp per year to reach 32 percent
 of projected oil and gas export revenue by the end of the fifth five-year development plan in 2015. This target was not reached,
 however, given the tightening of sanctions and drop in oil revenues starting in June 2014. For 2016 the proposed share of oil
 and gas revenues destined to the National Development Fund is 30 percent (see Figure 18). Funds may be withdrawn from the
 NDF to provide loans to private sector companies, cooperatives and economic enterprises owned by public non-governmental
 institutions. The NDF is currently held at the CBI.

  The 2015 Budget focused on strengthening domestic policies and developing a “resistance” plan to bolster the country’s
  resilience against external shocks. On the revenue front, measures aim to enhance tax compliance and broaden the tax base
  away from oil revenue, with the ultimate aim of reducing the share of oil revenue to total revenue from an average of 45 percent
  to 31.5 percent. This government objective is expected to be attained through a phased approach of increasing the share of oil and
  gas revenue destined to the National Development Fund. This should contribute toward improving the structural non-oil balance
  of the government which remains negative, with a deficit averaging over 9 percent of GDP in 2009-2014 (Figure 13). These
  measures would include a better targeting of large tax payers and other indirect taxes, such as on professional income and the
  taxation of capital gains in equity and real estate. Lower reliance on oil revenue would also be achieved through greater economic
  diversification. Much of the country’s ability to further diversify its economy will largely hinge on structural reforms to strengthen
  the business environment, in particular to improve the infrastructure system as well as the ease and cost of trading across borders,
  which remain weak relative to comparator countries (Box 6).

  The government is taking a number of steps to raise non-oil revenues. The VAT rate was increased from 8 percent to 9
  percent (of which 3 percentage points go to local governments) in March 2015 to compensate for the revenue shortfall related to
  the collapse of oil prices in 2014, which brings it more in line with those seen in other resource-rich countries, which currently
  range from 10 percent in Australia to 25 percent in Norway (with the exception of Nigeria which has a VAT rate of 5 percent).
  Overall, on the revenue side, the 2015 government Budget projects an overall revenue increase of 18.1 percent driven by a rise in
  taxation revenue more than offsetting a decline in oil revenue and a 19.8 percent increase in other revenue components. On the
  expenditure side, the 2015 Budget projects total spending to rise by 6.8 percent as a result of a 26.8 percent increase in wages, a
  33.7 percent increase in capital expenditure and a 7.5 percent decline in other components.

 Trading across Iranian borders remains cumbersome and costly according to the World Bank 2015 Doing Business assessment. In
 2015, the number of days required to export goods from Iran was 25 days compared to 13 days and 19.4 days for Turkey and the
 MENA region, respectively. Importing goods into Iran took 37 days compared to 14 days and 23.8 days on average for Turkey and
 the MENA region, respectively. Furthermore, 11 documents were required to import goods into Iran compared to 8 documents
 for Turkey and the MENA region. The cost of exporting and importing goods to Iran were 36 percent higher than Turkey and 16
 percent higher than the MENA region (Figures 23 and 24).

 Iran ranked 82nd on the quality of its overall infrastructure system, well behind comparator countries such as Turkey (33rd) and
 Malaysia (20th). Iran ranked relatively poorly on the quality of roads, port infrastructure, air transport infrastructure, available
 airline seat per km/week and mobile telephone subscriptions. In contrast, it ranked relatively well on the quality of railroad
 infrastructure, electricity supply and fixed telephone lines (Table 2).

                                                        Box 7. Global economic outlook.

  Global growth is projected to be tepid over the short- to medium-term, averaging 3.2 percent in 2016-2017 (Table 3). The
  upward growth trajectory is due to improvements in the United States and the Euro area which benefitted from lower oil prices.
  The American economy is expected to expand in the medium-term driven by an increase in private consumption. In particular,
  growth in the U.S. is projected to advance at an average rate of 2.6 percent in 2016-2017. In the Euro area, economic activity is
  also expected to accelerate on account of lower oil prices and a weakened Euro currency. Despite the Greek crisis, growth in the
  Euro area is projected to average 1.6 percent in 2016-2017. On the other hand, growth in China, a major importer of Iran’s oil, is
  expected to decelerate in the coming years from an estimated 7.4 percent in 2014 to a projected 7.1 percent and 7.0 percent in
  2015 and 2016, respectively.

  Choice of model and specification. We use the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) methodology to estimate the impact
  of increased oil exports which could be expected from a lifting of sanctions on total GDP and non-oil GDP growth. Figure 27
  illustrates that total real GDP and non-oil real GDP follow a similar pattern as oil exports (expressed in log terms), indicating the
  possible presence of long-run relationships between these variables. We use quarterly time-series data on the Iranian economy
  during the period Q1-1991 to Q4-2013. The set of endogenous variables consists of total real GDP (rgdp), non-oil real GDP
  (non_oil_gdp) and Oil exports (oil_exp). Furthermore, we add the GDP deflator (gdp_defl), illustrated as an additional endogenous
  variable in order to control for inflation which, according to Esfahani et al. (2013), is found to have a statistically significant
  negative long-run impact on real GDP.

  Figure 27 also shows the presence of two structural breaks: (i) the high volatility in oil prices in 2007-08 (Hamilton, 2009) and
  (ii) the tightening of US and EU sanctions on Iran since mid-2012. The first exogenous shock will be represented by a dummy
  variable, denoted by crisis, that takes the value of 1 between Q3-2007 and Q2-2009 and 0 otherwise, while the second, will be
  presented by a dummy variable, denoted by sanctions, that takes the value of 1 between Q3-2012 and Q4-2013 and 0 otherwise.
  In sum, our set of endogenous variables will be I={real GDP or rgdp , real non-oil GDP or non_oil_gdp, oil exports or oil_exp and
  the GDP deflator or gdp_defl} while the set of exogenous variables will be E={crisis, sanctions}.

  Given that we are interested in understanding the impact of an increase in oil exports on both total real GDP and non-oil real GDP
  we employ two different VECMs where the first one, denoted by model 1, includes the following set of endogenous variables I1=
  {rgdp, oil_exp and gdp_defl}, while the second one, denoted by model 2, includes I2={non_oil_gdp, oil_exp and gdp_defl}as the
  set of endogenous variables. In both models we also employ the set of exogenous variables E.*

  The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test shows that all the four endogenous variables are stationary after first differencing.
  In addition, we only find one significant (weakly significant) cointegration relationship in model 1 (2).** Consequently, the
  econometric specification (in vector notation) for model 1 is



  where vector represents the short-run dynamics’ coefficients while the matrix                          includes the error corrections and cointegration
  coefficients. On the other hand, model 2 is specified as



  where the vectors of coefficients          and      represent the short-run impacts whereas the matrix includes the error corrections and
  cointegration coefficients.

  Results. The results, presented in Table 4, suggest that in the long-run, a 1 percent increase in oil exports is associated with a 0.17
  (0.19) percent increase in total real GDP (non-oil real GDP). The coefficients on the Error Correction terms are negative, meaning
  that, in the short-run, deviations from the long-run equilibrium are adjusted. In particular, the magnitude of the coefficients
  suggests that 10.6 (12.6) percent of any diversion from the long-run equilibrium in model 1 (2) is adjusted within each quarter.

  The sixth 5-year plan (2016-21) is comprised of three pillars, namely, the development of a diversified economy, progress

  the fifth directive, with the exception of the target for defense spending which, at 5 percent of the government’s budget, signals
  Iran’s interest in boosting military capabilities in light of regional tensions. On the economic front, the development plan envisages

                                            Box 10. The 2016 central government budget.

 For its 2016 budget, the Rouhani government maintains the fiscal discipline of its previous two budgets. Central government
 expenditure planned to increase at the same pace at the projected rise in revenue (Table 6). On the revenue side, the 2016
 budget projects total revenue increase of 15.0 percent driven by an increase of 17.4 percent in taxation revenue, 2.8 percent in oil
 revenue, 45.2 percent in sale of assets and 11.4 percent in other revenue components. On the expenditure side, the 2016 budget
 projects a total expenditure rise of 15.0 percent as a result of a 18.8 percent increase in current expenditures, a 24.9 percent rise
 in capital expenditures and a 5.6 percent decline in other components.

 The government remains committed to improving the fiscal framework. On the revenue front, the government measures aim
 to enhance tax compliance and broaden the tax base away from oil revenue. Measures would include a better targeting of large
 taxpayers and other indirect taxes, such as on professional income and the taxation of capital gains in equity and real estate. Lower
 reliance on oil revenue would also be achieved through greater economic diversification. Much of the country’s ability to further
 diversify its economy will largely hinge on structural reforms to strengthen the business environment, in particular to improve the
 infrastructure system as well as the ease and cost of trading across borders, which remain weak relative to comparator countries.

30.	     Risks to oil prices remain largely tilted to
the downside. These include a possible increase
in supply due to: (i) resilient oil production in non-
OPEC countries as a result of some cost-efficiency
measures; and (ii) a rise in output from OPEC
producers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Moreover,
slower demand in China and other leading emerging
markets may put additional downward pressure on

                                     Box 11. Status of natural gas export pipeline schemes.

 Expansion of Gas Exports to Turkey. Iran has been exporting natural gas to Turkey since 2001 under a long-term take or pay deal
 of 10 bcm/y. Iran has been trying to convince Turkey to increase its import volumes to 20 bcm/y, but price has been an issue.
 Turkey is paying Iran a gas price of about US$14/MMBTU (per $100/bl oil) that is (about 20 percent) higher than the price Turkey
 pays for gas imports from Russia and Azerbaijan. The industry sources indicate that the Iran and Turkey are in the process of
 negotiating a lower price and higher volume of gas export.
 Iran-Pakistan Pipeline. This scheme was originally envisioned in early 1980s as a 40 bcm/y pipeline that would transport Iranian
 gas to Pakistan and onto India. However, India dropped out of the project in 1990s while Iran and Pakistan have continued their
 attempt to construct the pipeline system. In 2007 Pakistan and Iran signed a 30-year agreement according to which Iran would
 supply 21.7 bcm/year of gas with potential to increase to 33.1 bcm/year. The negotiated price is about $9/MMBTU per $100/bl oil.
 The 900km pipeline segment on the Iranian side has been completed. However, Pakistan has had difficulty mobilizing the required
 finance for building its 750km section of pipeline.

 Iran-Iraq Pipeline. The gas sale-purchase contract between the two countries was signed in 2013. The contract is for an export
 volume of 9 bcm/y in the first phase of the agreement and increasing to 14 bcm/y in the second phase. Construction of the pipeline
 system is almost complete. However, there are security concerns and some disagreement about pricing issues. There is also a
 separate, initial agreement between Iran and the Basrah Provincial Council for a further 7.2 bcm/year gas import from Iran. It is
 expected that the two countries will reach agreement by end 2015 and Iran could supply by end 2016 at least 2.5 bcm/year using
 existing gas infrastructure to the Basra power plant, which is close to the Iranian border.

 Iran-United Arab Emirates (UAE) Pipeline. In 2001 Iran signed a 25-year contract to supply gas from its Salman field to the UAE-
 based Crescent Petroleum at Sharjah in the UAE. The contract required Iran to export 5.2 bcm/y of unrefined sour gas to UAE at a
 reportedly low price. The project was supposed to have been completed in 2005 but there have been significant delays. Crescent
 Petroleum eventually took NIOC to arbitration in 2009 for the four year delay in supplying gas. The arbitration deliberations
 continue while the corresponding scheme has been the subject of much discussion in the press. The industry specialists have
 raised the idea that Iran and Abu Dhabi can cooperate in transporting gas from the Salman field to the neighboring Abu Bakhoosh
 field which is owned by Abu Dhabi and is nearly depleted. The distance between the two fields is only one kilometer and all
 infrastructure already exist on the Abu Dhabi side. The potential project is reportedly being discussed between the two sides.

 Iran-Oman Pipeline. Oman’s domestic gas production has stagnated in the recent years while its domestic consumption has
 increased sharply. As a result the amount of feed-gas to Oman’s two LNG export facilities have fallen. Therefore, Oman has some
 excess capacity in its LNG facilities. It has agreed in March 2014 to import about 10 bcm/year of gas from Iran. It is estimated that
 some 30 to 50 percent of the imported gas would be liquefied and sold on the global markets. The pipeline system will involve
 construction of a 200 km of undersea pipeline, and is expected to have a construction cost of about $ 1 billion and a construction
 time of about 3 years. Price of gas (and LNG processing fee) are still under negotiations.

 Iran-Kuwait Pipeline. The two countries have been discussing since early 2000s the construction of a 350-mile pipeline to carry
 about 2.5 bcm/year of Iranian gas to Kuwait. In the meantime Kuwait started importing LNG in 2009 to meet its growing domestic
 demand, which peaks during the summer. Although the seasonality of Kuwait’s demand gives LNG a comparative advantage, a
 pipeline supply (with suitable price terms) may still be worth consideration.

                                      Box 12. Management of the oil and gas sector in Iran.

 The Ministry of Petroleum has the overall responsibility for the strategic management of the country’s hydrocarbon resources.
 Under the supervision of the Ministry, there are four state-owned companies responsible for the activities of the oil and natural
 gas and petrochemical industry. There include:

    --   National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) that is responsible for the planning, implementation and operation of various oil
         sector activities including exploration, drilling, production, research and development, and export of crude oil. NIOC is
         one of the world’s largest oil companies. It has numerous subsidiaries including seventeen production companies and
         eight technical service companies.

    --   National Iranian Has Company (NIGC) that is responsible for natural gas downstream activities with a focus on processing,
         delivering, and distributing gas for domestic us. NIGC is one of the top ten gas companies in the gas industry in the Middle
         East and operates through several subsidiaries.

    --   National Petrochemical Company (NPC) that is responsible for planning, organizing, developing, supporting and leading
         the country’s petrochemical industry. NPC’s activity was initially limited to operating a small fertilizer plant. But now it is
         considered as one of the largest petrochemical companies in the Middle East.

    --   National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC) that is responsible for crude oil refining, products
         distribution and export and import of petroleum products. It has 19 subsidiaries and affiliated companies including
         refineries and various service companies.

utilized. The flared/vented gas has a market value of
approximately $4 to $6 billion/year. Aside from this
significance economic waste, gas flaring imposes a
serious impact on health and the global environment.
Gas venting has an even much larger (per unit)
impact. The potential impact of gas flaring/venting
on the global environment has been recognized by
the international community (Buzcu-Guven, B. et al.,
2010). It has become an area of serious attention
in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), the COP 21, and other
conventions.22

62.	      Iran’s petrochemical industry is one
of the largest in the Middle East. Activities of
the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) was
initially limited to operating a small fertilizer plant.
However, it now brings in the most revenues to
the country’s economy after crude oil exports. The
industry may gain significantly from sanctions relief.
Export of petrochemical products peaked at about
$15.2 billion in 2011 but declined to $12 billion in
2012 to 2014. The government intends to expand
this industry in order to extract more downstream
value-added from the hydrocarbon resources. The
pros and cons of such expansion should be studied
while taking account of the opportunity cost of the
feedstock and the prospects in the international
markets.




22  The World Bank has launched a public- private partnership
initiative called Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) in 2002
to provide technical assistance to the countries and companies
that attempt to reduce gas flaring/venting. Several bilateral
and multilateral climate change funds, particularly the Clean
Investment Fund, provide financial assistance to the projects
that are aimed at reducing gas flaring and venting.

65.	     The Iranian banking system is large, with
total assets of near 150 percent of GDP in 2010
(including assets by the CBI). The system consists
of 35 institutions divided into four broad categories:
three government owned commercial banks, five
specialized government banks, 27 private banks and
one near bank (Credit Institution for Development)
in 2014. Banks Melli (public), Mellat (privatized),
Maskan (public) and Parsian (private) dominate the
market. State and privately owned banks alike are

7.	     The pension funds are heavily involved
with governmental sector, as pensions include
the parastatal sector and share ownership in
many privatized companies. About a decade ago,
mandatory pension schemes of Iran covered more
than 40 percent of labor force; given public sector
size, the coverage could be higher (Robalino et
al., 200549). There were also occupational plans as
substitutes to the main scheme:  Iran had at least  20
occupational pension plans, all defined-benefit
arrangements (Robalino et al., 2005). Management
of pension funds had mandates unrelated to their
core functions such as to finance economic and
social development projects.

8.	    The recent Iranian privatizations enabled
parastatal pension funds to acquire equity
ownership in privatized SOE’s in lieu of cash
payments due. Additionally, the Social Security
Organization’s (SSO) investment company,
SHASTA, is one of the largest investment fund
companies. The SSO has holdings in 150 firms
with a combined market value of $15 billion in
2012, and has since increased its purchases of
government bonds and shares of SOE’s to relieve
government’s fiscal pressures (Harris, 201350).

9.	     The insurance sector is under-developed
in Iran: Total premiums are only 2 percent of GDP
as of 2014, however this is similar to Saudi Arabia
(0.85 percent) and UAE (2 percent), with 90 percent
of premiums coming from the non-life market
(EUI, 201451). There were 30 insurance companies
operating by March 2014, the largest being state
owned Iran insurance, which accounted for 41
percent of total premiums in Iranian insurance
sector as of March 2012 (EUI, 2014). Foreign
