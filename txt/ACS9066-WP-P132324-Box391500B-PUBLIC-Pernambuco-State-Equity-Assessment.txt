Introduction
Born in Pernambuco, Joao Cabral de Melo Neto is one of the best Brazilian poets of the twentieth
century. In Vida e Morte Severina, his beautiful dramatic poem, Cabral describes the long journey of a man
from the interior, migrating to the coastal area of the state in search of a better future. Severino, the
poem says, lives a life undistinguishable from many others (“…As there are many Severinos”):

                                                             “And all of us Severinos
                                                               With the same lives
                                                               Will die of the same
                                                              Severe Severino death,
                                                                  The death died
                                                             Of old age before thirty
                                                           Of an ambush before twenty
                                                           And of hunger day by day…”1

A severe, Severino life was indeed the fate of most people in Pernambuco—historically, one of the poorest
states of Brazil. The poem, in its vivid and musical metrics, describes the hardships and challenges faced
by people living in the poorest regions of the Brazilian Northeast, in Brazil as a whole or—for that
matter—in many other places of Latin America. Focusing on Pernambuco, to the interior of the state,
circumstances such as gender, location and race have historically been correlated with lower
socioeconomic achievement; a situation that mimics that of the rest of the country. Governments in the
state have tried to overcome the development gaps by establishing policies that increase the coverage of
services and create better opportunities.

The state of Pernambuco has undergone an important transformation over the last fifteen years. This
has been the result of the more stable macroeconomic environment in Brazil as a whole, but it is also
related to important policy reforms, including the expansion of the SUAPE port, the introduction of
incentives for private investors and extensive investments in social services. The present report aims to
analyze the policy factors associated with Pernambuco’s progress and challenges in closing gaps—with
the rest of Brazil, within its territory, and between individuals—through equitable growth.

Starting from the aggregate, the report first describes how Pernambuco has fared with respect to the rest
of Brazil, both in terms of economic and social welfare performance, over the last decade (2001-2012).
In a context of widespread economic growth, Pernambuco has done particularly well in recent years,
similar to or above the national average. A key challenge concerns the longer-term, where—


1Original, in Portuguese: “E se somos Severinos / iguais em tudo na vida, / morremos de morte igual, / mesma morte severina: / que é a
morte de que se more / de velhice antes dos trinta, / de emboscada antes dos vinte, / de fome um pouco por dia…”. Translation to English
borrowed from Milton, John (1998), “Severino in English”, Cadernos de Literatura em Tradução, n. 2, p. 107-11.
                                                                                                                                                                     4
notwithstanding the positive performance of recent years—the same level of growth may not be as
easily sustained.

The solid economic performance has been reflected in an improvement of social indicators, also
associated with the government’s interiorização strategy, a policy developed explicitly to increase the
coverage of public services in underserved areas, with a focus on the interior of the state. The decline in
poverty rates displays a trajectory towards convergence with Brazil and recently, a faster than national
decline of the Gini has brought Pernambuco’s income inequality below the national and Northeast level.

The study then delves into what is happening in the interior of the state, looking at territorial inequalities
and horizontal aspects of equity. To shed light on the Government’s interiorização development strategy,
the report analyses first whether economic convergence is taking place between municipalities within
Pernambuco. It is. The variation in income per capita among municipalities in Pernambuco has been
steadily declining in recent years (sigma convergence), suggesting that the improvement in equitable access
to services has translated into inequality reductions among municipalities. Furthermore, poorer
municipalities have grown more than richer ones (beta convergence), with positive effects on poverty
reduction. In both cases, the evidence reflects that interiorização policies are being effective in the
promotion of equitable growth.

Following economic convergence, we look at how the region is faring in terms of social welfare. Social
progress is assessed through a composite measure monitoring income inequality, monetary poverty,
multiple deprivations, and children’s likelihood to access basic services (measured through the Human
Opportunity Index, HOI). Indeed, between 2001 and 2011, Pernambuco progressed more in terms of
social welfare than the rest of the country and the Northeast, and is in fact, converging with Brazil in
terms of how equitably opportunities are distributed. The substantial increase in access to opportunities
has been pushed by changes both in the coverage and in the equity of access to services and assets.
Significantly, looking at the state as a whole, the expansions in access to services have been carried out
in such a way that the provision has been increasing for traditionally excluded groups (such as
individuals in rural areas, or those born to parents with lower education). When broken down by
circumstance, the distribution of opportunities is found to be determined, above all, by geographic
location, followed by the education of the household head. Given that geographic location is highly
correlated with characteristics of otherwise excluded groups, by addressing territorial gaps, other
inequalities are being tackled by association.

Zooming in at the municipality level, a key level in a federal state such as Brazil, all municipalities have
seen improvements in wellbeing, suggesting that interiorização policies are also being effective in this
aspect of shared prosperity. Furthermore, the municipalities with the initially lowest levels of social
welfare have improved relatively more than initially better-off municipalities.

While all municipalities have seen economic and social improvements and initially worse-off
municipalities have improved more than the better off, the gap between richer and poorer, both in
terms of GDP per capita and in terms of the diamond of social welfare, has only gotten bigger as the
absolute change needed by poorer municipalities to catch up is large. A policy response more focused

                                                                                                            5
on building up capacity in the provision of access to services in these municipalities could thus be of
help in achieving territorial equity. The establishment of a municipal fund (Fundo Estuadual de Apoio ao
Desenvolvimento Municipal – FEM) 2 in March 2013, which complements the funds received by
municipalities through the Fundo de Participação dos Municípios (FPM) 3 , goes in that direction, and the
findings of the equity assessment are expected to inform the next steps of this fund in light of the first
year of its implementation.

The last sweep in this zoom-in process looks at what is happening to people: how are households faring
in terms of poverty, access to services, economic opportunities? Despite the progress achieved in the
reduction of growth gaps and in the equitable coverage of social services, economic dynamics still shape
productivity patterns. Individuals move to the areas where there are more economic opportunities,
triggering the presence of agglomerations poles in the state—the most important one being the
Metropolitan Area of Recife (MAR). The report thus identifies ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors of migration, to
shed light on the municipalities more desirable to live or work in and why. Gravity models are used to
understand the policies and conditions that attract (or repel) people to migrate between municipalities.
Economic factors such as employment rates, the share of services in the economy, and income per
capita are found to pull people towards municipalities. As could be expected, people move to where
economic activity and jobs are, especially those in the service industry, and where better public services
(urban infrastructure) exist. On the other hand, factors that push people to migrate include extreme
poverty, high income inequality, and literacy.4

What has this meant for the households of Pernambuco? A mobility analysis using synthetic panels
shows that Pernambuco is doing slightly better than Brazil regarding intra-generational economic
mobility. Between 2003 and 2011, Pernambuco saw a larger share of the poor leaving poverty than did
Brazil and the Northeast region. Also, a slightly bigger proportion of the population joined the middle
2 The State Fund to Support Municipal Development - FEM was announced by Governor Eduardo Campos in February
2013 and aims to support municipalities in the implementation of projects that contribute to local development and allow the
resumption of investments whose performance had been compromised by the weakening of municipal finances

The total amount provided to the fund in 2013 is R$ 228 million. The goal is for those available resources to be used in
major works and interventions that can improve the quality of life and development of the municipality. Investments are
expected to be in the areas of urban and rural infrastructure, education, health, security, social development, environment and
sustainability. Resources are equivalent to an average monthly transfer from the Municipalities Participation Fund (FPM)
received by each municipality in 2012. Transfers from the FEM are to be released in four installments: the first 30 % of the
total allocated to the municipality on May 15, 2013, the second, also of 30 %, 60 days after the first one, and the third, 20 %,
by declaration of the mayor of application of resources. The fourth and final 20 % is to be transferred upon submission to
the State Government by the municipal administration of the final invoice of the work. The amounts allocated to each
county based on the criteria of the FPM.

3 The Fundo de Participação dos Municípios (FPM) is the main mechanism through which the Federal State transfers resources to

municipalities, per article 159 of the federal constitution. This allocation is calculated annually by the Tribunal de Contas da
União (TCU) and based primarily on the number of inhabitants of the municipality (currently based on the 2010 census) as
well as on GDP per capita of the state. Municipalities are in turn classified in 3 categories: capitals (federal and states) about
10% of the FPM in 2012; reserva (Municipalities with more than 142, 633 inhabitants) about 3.6% of the FPM in 2012; and
finally the interior (i.e. all other municipalities) which represents over 86% of the FPM.

4 Why literacy is found to be a push and not a pull factor is likely related to the fact that being able to read and write

facilitates an individual’s ability to migrate.
                                                                                                                                6
class in Pernambuco compared to the rest of the country and the Northeast. Nevertheless, very few
people originally in poverty were able to join the middle class and virtually no one in extreme poverty at
the beginning of the period had escaped poverty by the end. These findings have important implications
towards sustaining future inclusive growth.

Decomposing the changes in poverty and inequality, we find that even though public transfers have
played a part, labor income—consistent with regional findings for Latin America—has played a critical
role in the improvement of these indicators. Given the importance of income from labor, the report
concludes with an analysis of labor market dynamics. Unemployment and informality rates have fallen
and labor force participation has grown in the state—although a good part of this progress has
concentrated in the Metropolitan Area of Recife. Indeed, in 2009, household per capita income in the
interior of the state was half that of MAR. Within the interior of the state, the area around the new port
is concentrating the lion’s share of new jobs. While the state lags behind others with respect to
educational outcomes, the skill gap of the workforce is even larger in the interior, posing a constraint to
access the benefits of the growing sectors.

The overall assessment reflects that Pernambuco’s policies have yielded positive outcomes in both
economic growth and social indicators. An extra push in providing improved access to services and
increased social protection from extreme poverty may be necessary on the way forward for
municipalities lagging behind, in order to overcome persistent regional disparity in social welfare. Also
crucial is the investment in skills and productivity across the labor markets, to deepen and sustain the
achievement in poverty reduction and improvements in equity.

Finally, a key policy message refers to the distinction between policies that aim to have an influence over
endowments and those that attempt to impact returns. Policies can seek to have an impact, for instance,
over a person’s education (endowment), or over the price at which the market values that person’s
education i.e., wages (returns). Pernambuco is found to have followed both: increasing access to services
has successfully increased endowments, while the state has also followed a strategy of investing, via
subsidies, in returns—influencing, for example, the location of private sector investment. Previous
evidence suggests that universalizing access to services throughout the territory (independently of
location) and equipping individuals with the endowments necessary to take advantage of economic
opportunities, wherever they are, is more cost-effective than endeavoring to define where the poles of
economic activity and specific sectors of private investment are to be located. This report thus
recommends a stronger focus on endowments, and the better tuning of those endowments in access,
relevance (notably in terms of education and skills) and quality, and less so on returns.

The rest of the report is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a brief description of the context and
conceptual framework, and the objective pursued in the report. Section 2 shows the evolution of trends;
while the drivers behind poverty and inequality reduction are presented in Section 3. The analysis of
social progress convergence is introduced in Section 4. Section 5 describes the gravity analysis of
migration flows, while Section 6 looks at mobility in and out of poverty. A characterization of labor
market dynamics is provided in Section 7. Section 8 describes policy suggestions on the way forward and
final remarks.

1.      Context and framework

Over the past decade, Brazil’s strong GDP growth has also benefited the traditionally poorer
state of Pernambuco. Poverty reduction, both moderate and extreme, has accompanied this growth.
The reduction in poverty has followed similar trends to Brazil and the Northeast. Similarly, inequality
has also been declining in the state, leading the state to a lower level of inequality than Brazil or the
Northeast by the end of the decade. While Pernambuco is headed in the right direction, it is still behind
Brazil in terms of both GDP per capita and monetary and non-monetary poverty dimensions, and
within-state disparities remain.

Pernambuco faces two main challenges: establishing the foundations to sustain growth and
ensuring that territorial and horizontal inequities fall concurrently. In recent years, policy makers
have turned their attention to the large heterogeneity in social and economic indicators within
Pernambuco. Explicitly, these objectives have fallen under the concept of interiorização, a strategy to close
development gaps in the state through fiscal instruments and increased coverage of services in lagging
areas.

The State Equity Assessment aims to analyze some of the policy instruments associated with
Pernambuco’s progress in narrowing territorial gaps through equitable growth, and to highlight
policy challenges on the way to making the strategy sustainable.5 There are concerns that the
existing structure of fiscal policy and levels of endowments (i.e. human and physical capital) may
compromise the long-term feasibility and fiscal sustainability of the current growth pattern, given the
current economic context in the country. While growth can be a driver of poverty reduction, the vice-
versa also holds true. If equity—understood under the concepts of equality of opportunity; the ability to
make autonomous decisions regarding life plans, and the elimination of extreme poverty—constitutes a
key priority for policymakers, it can enhance both the strength of economic growth and its sustainability.
In order to promote shared prosperity, growth and equity must go hand in hand. Four policy areas that
are particularly conducive to promoting shared prosperity include: 1. Maintaining an equitable and
sustainable fiscal policy; 2. Strengthening fair, transparent institutions that deliver quality public goods
and services; 3. Enabling an environment of well-functioning markets that are accessible for all
economic levels of society; and, 4. Improving risk management at both the macro and household level.
These channels reinforce each other, thus forming a virtuous cycle (see Figure 1).

  Being aware of attribution problems, we look at the policies associated with the state’s progress without making claims
regarding causality.

Within this context, the present report continues the World Bank’s current dialogue with the
state of Pernambuco in its efforts to improve equity and inclusive growth in the long-term. The
study utilizes a variety of stocktaking and diagnostic tools, going beyond income measures, to inform
policy actions that seek to reduce poverty and inequality in Pernambuco. The policy discussion is
contextualized, drawing on the priorities set forth within the Pernambuco Government’s Management
Model—which has also benefited from the Bank’s technical assistance and financial support. The
Government’s strategy rests on three pillars: Nova Economia (interiorização strategy), Quality of Life, and
Government for Results, which are consistent with the channels that promote shared prosperity (see Box 1
and Figure 2).

                          Box 1. Shared Prosperity and the Pernambuco Strategy

Improving shared prosperity involves promoting both economic growth and equity. As shown next,
within the context of the channels that promote shared prosperity (Figure 1), the scheme followed in the
report is consistent with Pernambuco Government’s Model.

The Government’s All for Pernambuco—Results-focused, Democratic and Regionalized Management strategy rests
on three main pillars. The first, Nova Economia (New Economy), seeks to guarantee the continuation of
the current pace of economic growth and ensure its inclusiveness—both in terms of spreading the
benefits of growth to the interior of the state (interiorização strategy); and in ensuring that these benefits
reach all individuals, regardless of race, gender, and other dimensions of inequality. There is a clear
understanding that reaching the remaining poor and reducing vulnerability will require additional efforts
and increased efficiency in public spending. In the context of the channels conducive to shared
prosperity, Nova Economia’s redistribution of funds to marginalized areas and people, takes place through
the fiscal policy and stability channel, while by fostering well-functioning markets, Nova Economia can
ensure continued economic growth.

The second pillar refers to improving the quality of life of the citizens of Pernambuco, through the
improvement of access to services and the protection of citizens. The relevant channels for this pillar
include the delivery of quality public goods and services, and the improvement in risk management.

The third pillar focuses on government for results, establishing the conditions for better government by
increasing the capacity and efficiency of public administration. This pillar thus helps ensure that
expenditures are monitored towards results, and that goods and services are allocated fairly and
efficiently, also touching upon the public goods and services and fiscal policy channels.

The following figure illustrates the consistency between the shared prosperity virtuous cycle and
Pernambuco’s Management strategy.

To assess equitable growth within Pernambuco, the report employs a zoom-in framework of
shared prosperity using a variety of equity indicators and diagnostics. 6 We begin by broadly
comparing the state’s monetary and non-monetary indicators of poverty with the national and regional
trends. The report then uses a spatial lens to compare the trends between municipalities and between
região de desenvolvimento within Pernambuco in the framework of the interiorização policy priority. Along
these lines, the report also identifies push and pulls factors of migration, which shed light on the
identification of which municipalities are more desirable to live or work in and why. Finally, zooming in
further, economic mobility at the household level is considered along with trends in the role of labor
market dynamics, which affect the welfare and agency of individual workers.

Drawing from the findings of these diagnostics, the report presents policy recommendations
consistent with the state’s Nova Economia strategy to promote growth and equity. Throughout
the report, the analysis draws from the framework on the virtuous cycle of shared prosperity presented
in Box 1. For instance, the interventions related to the non-monetary dimensions of poverty and
inequality relate to the institutional and public goods and services policy channel; the role of economic
dynamics, labor market and incentives to the well-functioning markets area; while fiscal incentives and the
role of transfers in the reduction of monetary poverty to the fiscal policy and stability channel. All the
convergence and spatial analysis rests on the notion of equity regarding equality of opportunities,
namely: the place where an individual is born should not determine her opportunities—whereby
regional inequality is viewed as a circumstance.




6 This report considers a comprehensive definition of “equity”, which entails that citizens must have equal access to
opportunities, be able to live in dignity (i.e. elimination of absolute poverty), and have the autonomy and voice to participate
fully in their communities and decide over life plans they have reasons to value. This definition allows for a cohesive
characterization of intra and inter-generational mobility, chronic and transient poverty, and between-group inequities that
potentially thwart the possibility of certain vulnerable populations to fully participate and benefit from the development
process (Cord and Lopez-Calva, 2013).

                          Box 2. Pernambuco’s Evolving Economic Structure
Pernambuco is experiencing an investment boom which is expected to further modify the economic
structure of the state in the near future – with implications for growth and shared prosperity, notably
through labor markets. By some estimates, Pernambuco will receive about R$ 100 billion in investment
by 2016, two thirds of which to be directed towards the industrial sector. The composition of the state’s
manufacturing output will also continue to change most notably in relation to the Suape Industrial and
Port Complex driving the expansion of firms related to the shipbuilding, off-shore oil and gas,
petrochemical, automobile and steel sectors.

Pernambuco is also an important tourism destination both for entertainment and business. The tourism
is an important source of employment and income for many semi and skilled workers both along the
seashore and in the interior. Pernambuco also headquarters a hub for the IT industry with sites such as
Porto Digital and others technological parks. Created in 2000, Porto Digital is one of the pillars of the
state’s “New Economy” (Nova Economia) strategy. It is home to 260 firms selling for over R$ 1 billion
per year, two thirds of which are exported to the rest of Brazil and abroad. The future of the State´s
economy is no longer restricted to manufacturing but also encompasses business in the modern tertiary.
Health, education and services related to the so-called “creative economy” (filmmaking, video, etc.) are
also becoming key sectors for the state’s economy.




2.     Good economic, social performance translated into a positive decade

2.1    Pernambuco is making an economic comeback after a setback at the start of the decade

Pernambuco’s GDP growth rates since 2008 are leading the state to diverge further from the
Northeast and to converge with the national average. During the 1990s and the early 2000s
Pernambuco’s per capita GDP represented, on average, 56.6 percent of Brazil’s; this proportion fell to
51.7 percent in 2000, leaving Pernambuco to hover around 50 percent of Brazil’s GDP per capita until
2008 (Figure 3). The tide shifted in 2009 as Pernambuco performed better than the Northeast and Brazil
during the global financial crisis and the subsequent recovery period. In 2010, the estimated GDP
growth rate reached the highest level in a decade for the state, the region and the country, with
Pernambuco leading the way at 12.1 percent, before slowing back down in 2011 (Figure 4).

   While Pernambuco’s economic growth has been relatively strong compared to Brazil, the
   overall trend remains rather flat, which is concerning in a longer-term context—where the same
   level of growth may not be easily maintained. Sustaining above-average growth is necessary for
   Pernambuco to catch up with Brazil. While economic growth has reflected into a 3 percent average
   annual increase in GDP per capita in the state over the decade, in absolute numbers Pernambuco still
   lags behind: the state accounts for 4.6 percent of Brazil’s population, yet it only represents 2.5 percent of
   its GDP; and GDP per capita is only 54.8 percent of that in Brazil, making it the eighth poorest state in
   Brazil (2010) (Figure 5).

While unemployment and labor force participation have not shifted much over the decade,
economic growth in Pernambuco has been accompanied by a decrease in informality and
increase in skill levels. From 2001 to 2012, labor force participation only rose 5 points and
unemployment fell by less than 2 points from 2001 to 2012 in Pernambuco leaving it with a smaller
labor force compared to Brazil (59.2% vs. 65.9%) and higher unemployment (9.5% compared to 6.1%).
However, an increase of 15.6 percentage points for the share of the adult population achieving a
secondary level of education and a decrease of 12.9 percentage points in the informality rate in
Pernambuco indicate that job quality has increased. Indeed the real hourly wage has risen by almost 50
percent over the decade, reaching R$ 7.56 in 2012, though this falls well below the Brazil average wage
of R$11.30.

2.2      Poverty and inequality

Similar to the Pernambuco’s outpacing of economic growth in recent years, Pernambuco has
also reduced income inequality (as measured by the Gini index) faster than the Northeast and
Brazil since 2008. While Pernambuco started the decade with the highest level of income inequality at
0.62 compared to 0.60 in the Northeast and 0.59 in Brazil, by 2012, it had the lowest at 0.51 compared
to 0.54 in the Northeast and 0.52 in Brazil. Despite a significant increase in poverty in 2004, this
represents an 11 point reduction in income inequality over the decade, over half of which occurred since
2008.

The declining poverty rate in Pernambuco is consistent with the trend in the Northeast and
Brazil, displaying a trajectory towards convergence. From 2001 to 2012, Pernambuco reduced
poverty by 68.2%, slightly above Brazil’s 66.1% reduction and the Northeast region’s 62.9% reduction.7
However, poverty is still significantly higher in Pernambuco at 12.8% than in Brazil at 8% (2012).
Trends in the reduction of extreme poverty, a key objective of both federal and state’s governments, are
similar, with reductions in the share of the population living in extreme poverty of 67.3% in
Pernambuco, 64.6% in the Northeast, and 62.6% in Brazil.

The extreme poverty uptick during 2003—the only period of GDP decline in Pernambuco—
suggests that vulnerability to extreme poverty during crises still poses substantial risks. From
2002 to 2003, the poverty headcount increased by 18.2% in Pernambuco, compared to 7.1% in both
Brazil and the Northeast. Moderate poverty also rose, but to a lesser extent (7.2% in Pernambuco), with
the majority of the change due to the increase in poverty of the extreme poor. This likely reflects the
moderate poor falling into extreme poverty and the vulnerable falling into poverty during economic
crises.

Pernambuco expanded the coverage of key public services over the decade, with access rates
higher than those in the Northeast and closing the gap with Brazil. The Pernambuco Government
expanded access to the sewage network—the dimension with the highest deprivation rates across
areas—by more than the Northeast region and Brazil. Since 2001, 58.4% more Pernambucanos have
access to sanitation compared to an increase in access in the Northeast of 46% and in Brazil of 18.4%.
This helped shrink the sanitation gap in access rates between Pernambuco and Brazil by 11 percentage
points, but at 61.8% access, Pernambuco still falls 14.8 percentage points behind Brazil and is just above
the rate in the Northeast. Similarly, faster growth in access to safe water, 8 years of education for at least
one member of the household, and possession of assets in Pernambuco has reduced access gaps from
the rate in Brazil. However, at least 10% of the population in Pernambuco is deprived of access to
sanitation, access to safe water, educational attainment, and/or school enrollment and 7% of the
population is deprived of three or more of the dimensions considered.8

While access to education in Pernambuco is high and the quality of education has risen, both
still remain challenges to be addressed, especially to the interior of the state. In 2010, 96.4
percent of urban 10 to 14-year-olds in the state attended school, compared to 94.3 percent of rural
children in the same age group.9 In terms of school-completion lags, Pernambuco reduced the age-grade
distortion rate by nearly 36 percent from its 2000 level. However, at over 44 percent in 2011, the state’s
age-grade distortion rate remains higher than Brazil’s (32.8 percent), and implies that close to half the
students in Pernambuco do not graduate from secondary school on time. As of 2010, the percentage of
people aged 10 or older in Pernambuco who have a below-primary-school-level education is higher at

8
  The dimensions considered are access to sanitation, safe water, shelter, school enrollment, electricity, at least one
member of the household having 8 years of education, and possession of 2 out of the 3 assets of telephone,
refrigerator, and clean (gas/electric) cooking stove.

  The school attendance rate in Brazil, the Northeast, and MAR in the same year lied between 95 and 97 percent for both
urban and rural children 10 to 14 years of age.
                                                                                                                                                                                              15
57.8 percent than Brazil’s (50.2 percent), while the percentage of people with a college degree is lower at
5.7 percent than in Brazil (8.3 percent). Furthermore, the illiteracy rate of people ages 15 years and older
surpasses 20 percent in all regions of Pernambuco, except for Recife’s metropolitan area (8.9 percent)
and Sertão do São Francisco (15 percent). Illiteracy is highest in Agreste Meridional, at 31.6 percent. This high
illiteracy rate is not present in the case of younger generations, indicating that schooling has improved.
For instance, in 2011, only 3.6 percent of people ages 15 to 24 in Pernambuco were illiterate. While this
figure is still more than twice the rate in Brazil (1.5 percent), it is much lower than the rate when older
people are considered.


3.   Labor income and transfers have driven poverty reduction and
improvement of equity in Pernambuco
3.1     Poverty decomposition: 2001–2011
Within a decade of economic growth, both in Pernambuco and the rest of Brazil, which
components have contributed the most to the observed changes in poverty and inequality? To
answer this question, this section of the analysis employs a method called the Shapley decomposition of
changes in welfare indicators as proposed by Azevedo, Sanfelice and Nguyen (2012), following Barros et
al. (2006). It takes advantage of the additive property of a welfare aggregate by changing each
component at a time to calculate their contribution to the observed changes in poverty and inequality.

Labor income played a bigger role in reducing moderate and extreme poverty in Pernambuco
than it did in the Northeast and the country as a whole. Throughout the decade (2001-2011),
income from labor contributed more to reducing poverty than an increase in the share of occupied
adults (the case in other Latin American countries). The increase in income per employed adult was thus
the main factor in the reduction of poverty, as the poor benefitted from higher incomes either from
working more hours or through higher earnings per hour. Pernambuco has some room left to continue
reducing poverty through the labor market as the percentage of employed adults only contributed 3.02
percent to the reduction of moderate poverty and not at all in the reduction of extreme poverty. As
demographics are different (and play a different role) in the Northeast than in Brazil as a whole—the
share of adults and youth in the Northeast and Pernambuco is higher--more of these adults, especially
those in extreme poverty, need to be incorporated into the workforce.

Transfers have also played an important role, especially in the case of extreme poverty. The
impact of transfers on the reduction of extreme and moderate poverty was stronger in the Northeast
region (18.55 percent and 10.63 percent, respectively) and Pernambuco (17.53 percent and 9.9 percent)
than in Brazil (16.5 and 8.89 percent). This is not surprising given the higher level of poverty in the
Northeast and the explicit regional targeting of such populations by Brasil Sem Miséria and Bolsa Família.
An interesting comparison is that with Bahia, where transfers represented a much larger component of
the poverty and equity reduction (See Figures 8 and 9).

3.2                                        Inequality decomposition: 2001–2011
Labor income has also played a critical role in the reduction of inequality. Labor incomes
accounted for a 65.6 percent share of the inequality reduction in Pernambuco, higher than in the
Northeast region (53.2 percent) and Brazil (52.9 percent). Comparatively, in Bahia, labor income played
less than half of the role it did in Pernambuco while transfers accounted for the majority share of the
change in income inequality. The impact of income from labor on inequality in Pernambuco further
supports the results found in the poverty decomposition, indicating that the employed poor are not only
benefitting from economic growth, but they are benefiting more than the wealthy. On the other hand,
the share of occupied adults has a negative effect on the reduction of inequality, a somewhat surprising
finding that does not have a straightforward interpretation but may indicate that poorer adults are
having a tougher time entering or staying in the labor market, a situation that could be further
accentuated in case of economic shock or with an evolution of the labor demand towards higher skilled
jobs. This effect is more pronounced in urban – particularly in the metropolitan area - than in rural
areas, and is also confirmed when looking more specifically at decompositions of labor income.

The importance of transfers across areas, particularly in the Northeast, reflects the significant
role that they have played in tackling inequality over the past decade. Interestingly, when
restricting the analysis to recent years, i.e. 2009-11, transfers appear to play a substantially less important
role (accounting for less than three percent), a trend, which, if it continues into the future, indicates that
further gains in inequality reduction as a result from transfers can be expected to be more limited.

4.1                                      Economic convergence within Pernambuco
Is there convergence within Pernambuco? It has been shown above that, as GDP per capita grows
at a faster rate in Pernambuco than in the rest of Brazil, the state is “catching-up” or converging to the
nation. Here, the report looks into whether there is economic convergence within Pernambuco.

In the classical economics literature, the term "convergence" can take on two meanings: sigma
and beta. “Sigma-convergence” refers to a reduction in the dispersion of levels of income across
economies. “Beta-convergence”, on the other hand, occurs when poor economies grow faster than rich
ones. While the two concepts are related, they represent two different ideas: dispersion of economies in
the former and mobility of economies in the latter. In either case, evidence of convergence within
Pernambuco would reflect that the interiorização policies are being effective and that prosperity is shared.

Indeed, the variation of GDP per capita among municipalities in Pernambuco has dropped over
time, becoming lowest in recent years. The results indicate that sigma-convergence has indeed been
taking place from 2005 onwards, as the variation has declined from 0.45 in 2003 to 0.41 by 2010 (Figure
10). This convergence is particularly encouraging as it suggests that the improvement in access to
                                                                                                                                                                                       18
services in underserved municipalities of recent years has translated into inequality reductions between
municipalities.

Furthermore, poorer municipalities have strengthened their economies by relatively more than
richer municipalities. A high rate of GDP beta-convergence took place between 1996 and 2000; it
became insignificant from 2000 to 2005; but it picked up again between 2005 and 2010, though at a
slower pace than that of the previous decade. This means that if the current rate of convergence was to
continue, in 10 years the gap in GDP per capita amongst municipalities would be less than half the level
in 2005.

The evidence described here indicates that, in an overall context of growth for the state,
economic growth is taking place across the territory and that it is taking place in lagging
municipalities faster than in richer ones. The analysis presented in the next section explores whether
the same can be said of social welfare, measured as a composite index of equity-related indicators.

4.2     Social welfare convergence
In this section, diamonds of social progress are constructed to map achievements and gaps in
different aspects of social welfare for multiple time periods. Within the framework of shared
prosperity, we use this instrument to analyze social welfare, constructing a diamond for the state of
Pernambuco to compare it with Brazil and the Northeast. The analysis is then extended to both
Pernambuco’s região de desenvolvimento (RD), and its municipalities to shed light on the achievements of
the state’s interiorização objective.

The diamond’s four axes are composed by the Gini index, the absence of extreme monetary
poverty, the positive gap of deprivations, and the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) (see Box 3
for details on the HOI). Each of the four indicators is placed on a scale of zero to one, with one
representing the socially optimal outcome. The area of the diamond, then, represents the composite
indicator of social welfare and can take on a maximum value of two. Comparing the diamonds over time
provides a sense of social progress for the area considered, and can inform the design and evaluation of
the different components of social policy by looking at the decomposition of changes in the indicators.

alternating with income measures, where the maximum area (socially optimal) of the diamond is 2 (See
Annex 3).


4.2.1       Pernambuco vis-à-vis Brazil and the Northeast

Created by the World Bank’s Latin America unit in 2008, the HOI measures inequalities in
human opportunity and can help implement programs to most effectively overcome them. The
HOI estimates how personal circumstances which an individual cannot be held accountable for—like
birthplace, gender, or socioeconomic background—affect a child’s probability of accessing the basic
services necessary to succeed in life, such as education, health care, adequate nutrition or running water.
The HOI combines, in a single measure, how far along a society is toward providing universal coverage
of these basic services, as well as how equitably these services are distributed. With this information,
policymakers can better design and target basic services more equitably. The HOI runs from zero to
100; a society that has achieved universal coverage of all services would score at 100.

The HOI is coverage corrected for equity. The HOI measures the availability of services that are
necessary to progress in life (say, running water), discounted or “penalized” by how unfairly the services

                                                                                                                  21
are distributed among the population. So, two countries that have identical coverage may have different
HOIs if the citizens that lack the service are all female, or black, or poor, or have many siblings or, more
generally, share a personal circumstance beyond their control. In theory, the HOI can increase by
changing people’s circumstances (the “composition effect”), providing more services to all (“scale
effect”), or distributing service more fairly (“equalization effect”).

                              Box 4. The Human Opportunity Index (HOI)

The Human Opportunity Index is a synthetic measure of inequality of opportunity in basic services for
children running from 1 to 100. The index is inspired by the social welfare function proposed by Sen
(1976), and holds that a development process in which society attempts to equitably supply basic
opportunities requires ensuring that as many children as possible have access to those basic
opportunities, with a target of universalism. It requires distributing available basic opportunities
increasingly toward the more disadvantaged groups.
The Human Opportunity Index summarizes both elements in a composite indicator:
    How many opportunities are available, that is, the coverage rate of a basic service; and
    How equitably those opportunities are distributed, i.e., whether the distribution of that coverage
     is related to exogenous circumstances.
An increase in coverage of a basic service at the national level will always improve the index. But, if that
increase in coverage is biased toward a disadvantaged group (for example, a poor region), it will further
reduce inequality of opportunity, increasing the index more than proportionally.
The HOI methodology used in the Pernambuco Equity Assessment follows Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-
Juarez’s (2012) construction of a distribution-sensitive human development index by calculating access
to services based on geometric means of the average of access of circumstance groups.


From 2001 to 2011, Pernambuco progressed more in terms of social welfare than Brazil and the
Northeast. Looking at multiple indicators of social progress reveals that Pernambuco has made great
strides in development over the past decade. In fact, Pernambuco increased the diamond of social
progress index by 64.4 percent compared to a 54.9 percent improvement in the Northeast and a 25
percent improvement in Brazil. This progress has caused Pernambuco to pull ahead of the Northeast
along these dimensions and to close the gap with Brazil by 68.7 percent.

Close to half of Pernambuco’s progress was driven by a significant improvement in the HOI,
pushed in turn by expansions in equitable access to assets and sanitation. 51.4 percent of the
change in the area of the diamond in Pernambuco between 2001 and 2011 was due to improvements in
the HOI. Driving the change in the HOI was a 77 percent increase in the share of children living in
households with basic assets (adjusted by equity) and a large increase in access to sanitation and safe
water (up 204.9 percent and 56.5 percent, respectively). In fact, access to sanitation contributed 43.9
percent of the change in the HOI while possession of basic assets contributed 21.26 percent. But,
equitable access to sanitation in Pernambuco remains a key issue because, despite significant

                                                                                                         22
improvements, its HOI (83.6 out of 100) is still low. Equitable access to electricity (99.9) and school
enrollment (98.5) is near universal, but more progress is still needed in terms safe water (81.4).

Decomposing the HOI by services reveals that the improvement in the HOI is due not only to
changes in coverage but to changes in the equity of access to sanitation but not to assets. For
instance, if the HOI for Pernambuco was neutral to changes in distribution, the changes in the coverage
of sanitation and assets would have contributed 5.9 and 6.8 points, respectively to the HOI’s increase
between 2001 and 2011.10 In comparison, when accounting for equity in the expansion of coverage, the
HOI increase attributable to these dimensions is 13.3 and 6.4 points, respectively. This reveals that
access to sanitation has not only expanded in terms of coverage, but that equity of access has improved
as well. By contrast, the improvement to the HOI due to assets was driven by an increase in coverage
only.

Pernambuco is converging with Brazil in terms of how equitably opportunities are distributed.
The HOI in 2011 would have been 4.1 points higher in Pernambuco, if equity were not considered. This
‘equity penalty’ is similarly low in Brazil (2.7 points) and the Northeast (5.2 points). This represents a
drastic improvement in equitable distribution when compared to 2001, when both the Northeast and
Pernambuco received a penalty on the HOI (of 15.5 and 13.2 points, respectively) significantly higher
than in Brazil (6.5 points). However, Pernambucano children located in rural locations, regardless of
parental education, race, or gender, have lower access rates to water and sanitation than children in
urban areas.

When broken down according to circumstance, the distribution of opportunities follows a clear
pattern with location as the main determinant of access, followed by household education.
Table 1 shows a striking pattern in the access to goods and services in Pernambuco. Across the board,
children located in rural locations have lower access rates than children in urban areas. The level of
education of the household head is the next determinant of access, both within rural and urban locations
(e.g., within a given location but regardless of race or sex, children living with a household head who has

below-primary-level education have, on average, lower access rates than those with a head who has a
primary education). This is particularly important, since children of all coverage groups—who represent
more than five percent of the population—belong to households with a head who has a–below-primary-
school-level of education. Following household head education is race: white children receive more
coverage than afro-descendants—except for a group which represents only 0.03 percent of the
population (~606 children), and refers to rural, male afro-descendant children who live with a household
head that has a tertiary level education. Following is the gender breakdown, with females generally
receiving more opportunities than males, although the breakdown is less consistent.11

11These patterns hold up when looking at specific dimensions with the exception that children living in rural households
headed by someone with tertiary education generally have more access than those in urban households headed by someone
with a below-primary-level of education. Table 1 excludes electricity and enrollment as these dimensions are above 95
percent for all groups.

Notes: 1) Average Coverage denotes the simple average of coverage rates for sanitation, safe water, electricity, assets, and school enrollment. 2) Race, here,
includes only afro-descendants (pretos and pardos in the Census) and whites. Other races represent ~1.6 percent of the population and are excluded in the
HOI calculations. 3) HH education represents the highest education level completed by the household head.

4.2.2      Development Regions (Regiões de Desenvolvimento)

All Regiões de Desenvolvimento (RDs) in Pernambuco registered social progress, although
Western RDs still performed below Eastern RDs and the regional gap is growing. Between 2000
and 2010, the diamond area of every RD expanded. This progress is not trivial—the average change in
RDs located in the Western part of the state was 116.5 percent, slightly outperforming the RDs in the
Eastern region, which changed at an average of 105.7 percent—and it reflects the advancement that the
state has made toward fulfilling its interiorização objective. In absolute terms, however, Eastern RDs
outperformed Western ones, causing the gap in the social diamond between the East and West to rise by
45.3 percent from 2000 to 2010. As Figure 14 shows, all of the Eastern RDs (left-hand side) had a larger
social diamond in 2010 than all of the Western RDs (right-hand side). The only exceptions refer to the
Western Sertao Sao Francisco area (which performed all-around second best, only behind the Metropolitana
RD) and the Eastern Agreste Meridonal (which performed all-around second worst, only ahead of Sertao
Araripe).

Social progress extended across dimensions with improvements in the HOI contributing the
most. Each of the four indicators considered in the diamond of social progress improved, in every RD,
between 2000 and 2010. As Figure 15 illustrates, the HOI contributed the most to the changes in the
diamond for each RD; while, in general, the changes in the Gini index contributed the least, as can be
expected given the construction of the diamond index given that the Gini generally moves by less than
the HOI. Interestingly, the two RDs for which the Gini contributed more than another indicator refer
to the RDs which changed the most in relative terms—Agreste Setentrional and Sertao Araripe. At the same

time, the RD that had the lowest contribution from and the lowest change in the Gini also experienced
the least total change (absolute and percentage-wise) in social progress (Metropolitana). This may indicate
the existence of untapped potential for fiscal redistribution, which could have important impacts on
social progress, especially for an RD like Metropolitana, which, in 2010, outperformed all other RDs in
terms of HOI (0.82), positive gap of deprivations (0.87), and absence of extreme poverty (91.5 percent),
yet performed the worst in terms of Gini (0.65).

4.2.3      Municipalities

Municipalities in the interior are lagging, according to indicators of social welfare, though there
is evidence of social convergence. Using a composite index of social welfare12, in 2000, 53.6% of
municipalities located in the Western Regiões de Desenvolvimento (the Sertões ) ranked among the bottom
40% of municipalities in the state compared to only 34% of municipalities in the East. In 2010, the gap
remained, with 58.9% of the western municipalities among the bottom 40 percent compared with 31.8%
of those in the East. Note that while this ranking by location has not improved, the bottom 40% of
2000 did better in improving the social welfare index from 2000 to 2010 (14.3% annually, on average)
than the top 60 (9.62%, on average).

  The “diamond index” of social welfare comprises the positive complements of Gini and extreme poverty as well as
access to basic services, and the HOI. It is calculated as the area of a diamond composed of these elements on the
vertices (with monetary indicators across from each other and non-monetary indicators across from each other) and
runs from 0 to 2.

Improvements in monetary dimensions of welfare played a larger role in increasing social
welfare in initially less developed municipalities. Reductions in income inequality and absolute
poverty played a larger role in expanding the diamond of social welfare in municipalities in the bottom
40% by the diamond of social welfare index in 2000 than those in the top 60% with contributions
among the bottom 40 of 9.5% and 11.7% percent, respectively, compared to 5.8% and 8.4% among the
top 60 (Figure 17). Conversely, improvements in the HOI and eliminating deprivations played a larger
role in the top 60 of 2000 vis-à-vis the bottom 40.
This has caused the gap between initially developed compared to less developed municipalities
to shrink in terms of monetary dimensions but to rise in terms of the equitable distribution of
opportunities. The gap between the bottom 40 by social diamond in 2000 and the top 60 in terms of
the gini complement, positive gap of deprivations, and absence of extreme poverty all shrank between
2000 and 2010–by 85.7%, 11.1%, and 43.1%, respectively; however, the gap in the HOI rose by 34.2%,
from 14 points to 19 points. Given the difference in the importance of HOI to change in social welfare
(11.6 percentage points), this is not surprising, but it does point to the necessity to focus on investing in
human capital and providing people with an equal starting point, which has short and long-term
consequences for social welfare and economic progress, in addition to focusing on monetary outcomes,
which is more of a solution for short term problems, albeit important ones.

The social and economic convergence across municipalities is a good signal that the state’s equitable
development is in line its interiorização strategy. But, the convergence has been insufficient to close
the gap between richer and poorer municipalities – a challenge that will be more difficult to address
under less favorable economic circumstances. For instance, the difference in GDP per capita between
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  28
municipalities in the bottom 40% and those in the top 60% in 2000 is still R$1,579 (more than the
R$1,229 gap in 2000). And the difference in the social welfare index between the bottom 40% by social
welfare in 2000 and the top 60% is 0.253 points - greater than that in 2000 (0.202 points). So, the lagging
municipalities continue to face specific spatially and capacity-related challenges, impeding their ability to
catch-up to wealthier municipalities and requiring strategic interventions.


5.       Gravity analysis of migration flows and associated factors

The analysis of social progress is further enhanced when accounting for the migration movement in
Pernambuco. While a number of these migrations occur within municipalities, to better understand what
municipal policies and conditions attract (and repel) people, this analysis is conducted on migrations
between municipalities. Evidence from the gravity models can further inform the results of the
economic growth and social welfare within municipalities presented above by throwing light on how
these factors interact and what this interaction means for policy makers in terms of setting priorities to
enhance territorial equity. This is especially important to plan the next steps of the interiorização strategy
to ensure its cost-effectiveness and sustainability, notably as it relates to social welfare, economic
growth, and labor markets. Before analyzing the pull and push factors of migration at the municipal
level, a broad overview of migration by região de desenvolvimento is presented to give a sense of general
migration patterns over the last decade.

5.1      Net migration flows13

Within state migration in Pernambuco indicates that migrations are moving to RDs with poles
of centrality. As shown in Figure 19, within Pernambuco, migrants are moving to Metropolitana (48.5
percent of negative net migration), Sertão Do São Francisco (24.1 percent of negative net migration), and
Agreste Central (20.2 percent of negative net migration) and Agreste Setentrional (7.1 percent of negative net
migration). This is not surprising given that Metropolitana contains the metropole Recife while Sertão Do
São Francisco and Agreste Central have the two regional capitals for Pernambuco as classified by the
REGIC survey—Petrolina and Caruaru, respectively, the latter of which also has a localized sphere which
may be influencing immigration into Agreste Setentrional as well.



Proximity also plays a role in migration choices between RDs with higher shares of immigrants
for the top destinations coming from nearby RDs. The RD sending the most people to Metropolitana,
Agreste Central, and Agreste Setentrional is Mata Sul. In fact, almost 50 percent of positive net migration in
Pernambuco can be attributed to Mata Sul. Following Mata Sul for positive net migration are Mata Norte
(10.9 percent) and Agresete Meridional (10.2 percent), due in most part to proximity to Metropolitana in the
former and Agreste Central in the latter. In the case of Sertão do São Francisco, the top two places
immigrants come from are the neighboring RDs of Sertão Araripe and Sertão Central.

 Figures are citing migration flows from the last placed lived if a person moved since 2000. Similar patterns emerge using
13

migration flows from the place lived in 2005 if it was different than in 2010.
                                                                                                                       29

Note: Net migration represents movements within PE from the previous municipality of residence if an individual had moved to the 2010 municipality of
residence since 2000.

5.2        Push and pull factors

Determining the drivers of migratory flows from municipalities in the interior of Pernambuco to
urban centers can shed light on factors that policies can potentially influence. To do so, the
analysis rests on a gravity model based on economic and demographic characteristics of the municipality
of origin and destination to identify push and pull factors at the municipality level.14 This assessment can
shed light on the role that household vis-à-vis geographical endowments play in explaining economic
growth patterns and their spatial implications on social welfare.

Gravity models can provide useful insights to the state of territorial development, identifying
where the attraction poles lie. Determining the drivers behind attraction poles can provide policy
makers with more evidence over the strength of economic agglomeration effects to inform interiorização,
as well as what is working in terms of quality of life, since migration can be a way for citizens to “vote
with their feet” (See Tiebout, 1956). Additionally, negative social welfare factors preventing people from
migrating can be pinpointed to better understand what could be keeping people from exerting agency.


 The model, following Soloaga and Lara (2005) defines the migrant flow from municipality i, which currently resides in
14

municipality j, in terms of the demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors.

                                                                                                                                                 30
For example, an external factor such as low literacy may limit an individual’s choice to migrate,
impacting the socioeconomic set of opportunities and choices available to them.

Extreme poverty, high income inequality, and literacy are all push factors in migration. People
will likely choose to migrate if they feel that the gains from living elsewhere will be higher than the
cost—monetary and social—of moving. Some people, however, may not be able to move if they cannot
meet this cost, reflecting the array of development factors that play a role in the migration decision. The
analysis indicates that while extreme poverty at the municipality of destination is a push factor, both
high income inequality and literacy are push factors at the municipality of origin. Being able to read may
be a prerequisite to migration, which may explain why literacy is a push, rather than pull, factor. Access
to running water as a push factor appears more counterintuitive, but it may also be explained by a
minimum level of development or health as being a requirement to migrate. In addition to demographic
factors pushing people to migrate, such as larger household sizes at the origin and destination, and
greater population sizes, and higher shares of females in the population at the origin also acts as a push
factor.

Economic factors such as employment rates, the share of services in GDP, and GDP per capita
are pulling people towards municipalities. Additionally, the share of 25 to 49 year olds is also an
attracting factor at the origin and destination; although, the sign changes for the destination once the
squared term is included. At the same time, population density at the origin is also a pull factor. These
factors indicate that people are likely moving to where economic activity and jobs are, especially those in
the service industry. Access to sanitation also appears as a pull factor at the origin suggesting that urban
infrastructure plays a role in attracting migrants.

Distance from Recife appears to attract migrants at the destination yet it acts as a push factor at
the origin. This may indicate that people from municipalities located further from Recife are more
mobile but do not move very far. This is corroborated by the expected result that increased distance
between origin and destination suppresses migration.

6.         Mobility out of poverty

Economic mobility, or the ease with which individuals can improve their economic status over
time, is crucial for sustained poverty reduction in a state such as Pernambuco, where poverty
rates remain above the national average. A key element of equity in society is the elimination of
extreme poverty, as is reflected in the quality of life objective of the state. Determining, not only the
degree of upward or downward mobility in Pernambuco—especially in terms of moving out of
poverty—but also which members of society are most vulnerable, can provide key inputs to policies
regarding both poverty reduction and protection from vulnerability.

To measure intra-generational economic mobility, this analysis relies on the construction of
“synthetic panels”. This methodology uses two cross sections of data (Census 2000 and Census 2010)
to compare whether or not someone is actually poor in one period to an approximation of whether they
are poor in another period (See Box 4). The analysis can thus show the number of people who stayed
poor, rose out of poverty, or fell back into poverty between the time periods. Movements into and out
of vulnerability to poverty and the middle class are also tracked in order to understand the extent to
which people are able to move across income groups.15




 Income groups are based on the Secretaria de Assuntos Estratégicos 2012 report “Comissão para Definição da Classe
15

Média no Brasil.”
                                                                                                                                                          32
                                      Box 5. On synthetic panel methodology
Following the synthetic panel approach recently developed by Dang, Lanjouw, Luoto and McKenzie
(2011), the equity assessment analysis looks to identify those who left and those who stayed in poverty,
and the potential hypotheses that lie behind the trends. The main advantage of this approach is that it
does not need to impose much structure on the individual income generating process. Instead, it allows
us to calculate lower and upper bounds on the movements in and out of poverty, depending on the
assumption regarding the individual-specific error term. Synthetic panel are built using two cross-section
datasets, by estimating the relationship between income and two sets of variables:

      i.       Time-invariant variables at the household level: traits such as gender, year of birth and
               parental education that do not change throughout a life time – for each year;

      ii.      Time-variant variables at the municipality area level such as: unemployment rate, population
               of working age, displacement rate etc.

Combining the observed and predicated household income, it is possible to study the movements in and
out of poverty over the period, and the characteristics of those who stayed below the poverty line, those
who escaped poverty, and those that fell below the cut-off.

Note: Different assumptions about the residuals yield the lower and upper income bounds–the
assumption that error terms between periods are perfectly correlated systematically underestimates
mobility between periods. This functional form is thus used to estimate the lower-bound on mobility.
Conversely, assuming that the error terms are perfectly uncorrelated overstates the amount of mobility;
this equation is thus employed to calculate the upper bound on mobility.

A larger percentage of the population, but a smaller percentage of the poor, left poverty in
Pernambuco than in Brazil from 2003 to 2011. In 2003, a larger percentage of the population in
Pernambuco was poor (39.3 percent) compared to Brazil (22.4 percent). By 2011, 11.5 percent of the
population in Pernambuco was able to leave poverty, compared to 8 percent in Brazil. As a percent of
the initial level of the poor, this leaves Pernambuco slightly behind Brazil as 29.3 percent of the poor in
Pernambuco left poverty while 35.9 percent of the poor in Brazil left poverty. Compared to the
Northeast however, Pernambuco pushed more people out of poverty both as a percentage of the total
population and as a percentage of the poor.

A slightly larger percentage of the population joined the middle class in Pernambuco compared
to Brazil and the Northeast (Tables 4 and 5). Of the total population, 11.1 percent of people in
Pernambuco graduated to the middle class compared to 10.9 percent in Brazil and 9.7 percent in the
Northeast. This pushed the middle class to 47.3 percent of the population in 2011 in Pernambuco,
which still represents almost a third less of the population vis-à-vis Brazil, where 69.2 percent of people
are in the middle class.

However, very few people originally in poverty were able to join the middle class and virtually
no one in extreme poverty in 2003 had escaped poverty by 2011. Only 0.2 percent of those
originally poor in Pernambuco were able to gain economic security, while 1.1 percent of the poor in
Brazil moved into the middle class. Furthermore, of those originally extremely poor in Pernambuco,
while 27.2 percent improved their incomes, virtually none left poverty, indicating that there remain
barriers limiting people from rising economically and, if they are able to do so, from substantially
increasing their incomes.

6.2        Characteristics of households

Rural households and households headed by informal workers, females, and afro-descendants16
have a harder time rising out of poverty in Pernambuco compared to urban households and
households headed by formal workers, males, and whites (see Figure 21). Between 2003 and 2011,
30.4 percent of urban households which were poor in the beginning of the period escaped poverty
compared to 27.1 percent of originally poor rural households. Similarly, a slightly higher share of
households headed by whites left poverty compared to afro-descendants. While rates of upward mobility
were higher for both groups, a larger gap between the shares of poverty leavers was found between
formal and informal workers in Pernambuco, at 54 percent compared to 34.1 percent of households
escaping poverty in each group, respectively. However, the largest disparity in the share of originally
poor households that left poverty occurred between males and females. In Pernambuco, while 39.8
percent of male headed households left poverty, only 11.8 percent of female headed households were
able to do so. These trends are consistent across the Northeast and Brazil, with a slightly larger gap
between blacks and whites and between males and females, and a smaller gap between urban and rural
locations and formal and informal workers.

Counter to intuition, a higher share of households headed by people with lower levels of
education graduated from poverty, compared to households headed by people with higher
levels of education. From 2003 to 2011, one third of households headed by individuals with below-
primary-level school education graduated from poverty, compared to 18.2 percent of households headed
by individuals whose highest level of education was primary school and to only 11 percent of
households headed by individuals who completed secondary school. This result should be read in light
of the construction and infrastructure boom in Pernambuco over the past decade that has led to an
increase in lower-skilled labor demand, and indeed allowed for a larger number of poorer household to

engage in the labor force, as shown in our previous analysis of the factors that have most contributed to
poverty reduction in the state. Additionally, no households headed by an individual with a college degree
escaped poverty. These results can be explained by the fact that few households with higher levels of
education were in poverty to begin with (8.9 percent of the poor in 2003 had a secondary level
education and less than one percent had a college degree), so the sample of households that were in
poverty in 2003 and had these levels of education were probably poor for reasons that may have made it
harder to escape from poverty. In other words, it is unlikely that increased education is keeping people
from leaving poverty, but rather, the fact that these individuals are poor despite their higher education
may indicate a selection bias in this group.


7.         Labor markets, skills, and earnings mobility

Given the importance of labor income in explaining poverty and inequality, and the role of the labor and
economic forces in determining migration in Pernambuco, this section presents an overview of labor
market dynamics. The analysis covers territorial and sectoral trends, wage determinants, and workers’
transitions across sectors and firms.

     7.1      Territorial disparities in the labor market

Over the past decade, Pernambuco experienced growth in labor force participation and an
important decline in unemployment and informality; yet, most of this progress has
concentrated in the Metropolitan Area of Recife (MAR). Since 2000, labor market participation has
grown at a 1.6 percent annual rate.17 Due to faster employment creation, the unemployment rate fell in
the Recife Metropolitan area, and the share of the labor force employed informally decreased (from 64
to 60 percent between 2001 and 2009).18 In 2011, there were over 112 thousand more formal jobs in the
state than in 2010.19 Importantly, average income from the main job increased at a two percent annual
rate over the last decade, bringing up living standards along the employment creation. Progress however
is heterogeneous. More than 70 percent of the state’s GDP is being produced in the coastal area; while,
in 2009, household per capita income in the interior of the state was half that of the MAR.

Weak skills foundations in the interior of the state pose an important constraint for inclusive
growth. Pernambuco lags behind other states in Brazil with respect to educational outcomes. According
to the 2010 Population Census, 57.8 percent of individuals 10 years old or older in the state have a
schooling level below primary school while the national average is 50.2 percent. In terms of tertiary
education, the share of the population in the state who completed a college degree, at 5.7 percent, also
lag behind the national average (8.3 percent). Importantly, skill gaps are even broader to the interior of
the state. The previous specialization pattern in the interior of the state (agriculture and tourism) is in
strong contrast to the MAR’s. The skill profile of the existing workforce limits their access to the
benefits of the expanding sectors, and imposes a constraint for firms’ growth potential. Through job

creation, new investment can transform lagging areas and promote regional development. Nevertheless,
business viability—and therefore, private sector willingness to invest—depends to a great extent on the
quantity and quality of human resources available. The state is taking steps towards removing these
constraints to growth (see Box 5).

                        Box 6. Expanding training and education in Pernambuco

Fostering employability is a key area for the Pernambuco government to tap into a large unrealized
growth potential and promote inclusive growth. Given the skill gaps, expanding vocational training and
technical education have been made a priority by the state. In the port area, the government, in strong
communication with employers, invested in vocational training for the existing workforce and
professional education for school-age children. The same model is now being followed in the areas
where the FIAT factory is being installed. Through this model, the government expects to continue
attracting new investments to the interior, bringing jobs and prosperity for the people. Shorter-courses
for the existing workforce were also complemented by the expansion of technical education for school-
age children and young adults. In early 2007, Pernambuco had only seven state vocational schools–
technical schools (Escolas Tecnicas Estaduais) with a total enrollment of 1,300 students. In 2012, this had
grown to 29 schools and 15,000 students. Additionally, a Vocational Training distance education system
was established which now offers 11 distance learning courses, distributed in 23 poles, where about
4,600 students are enrolled.


   7.2     Trends in wages in Pernambuco

Hourly wages in Pernambuco are still lower than in Brazil across sectors, but have grown much
faster than the national rate in public services and services. The average hourly wage rate in
Pernambuco varies across sectors, from R$2.66 in agriculture to R$12.56 in public services (Figure 22).
The general trends in payment scale by sector vary similarly with the national level with electricity,
agriculture, and commerce on the lower end, and public services and services on the upper end.
Between 2009 and 2011, high annualized growth rates in the hourly wage were prevalent in the
agriculture, public services, and services sectors in Pernambuco, and growth in electricity was much
higher in Brazil, while growth in public services and services was more modest (Figure 23). These high
growth rates may reflect an increase in the demand for labor. On the other hand, they also may indicate
a shortage in the supply of qualified workers.

Age, formality, gender, and skill are all significant factors in determining hourly wages at both
the national level and in Pernambuco. Controlling for these factors shows that skill level and
formality are the greatest determinants of hourly wage, with gender close behind. These factors affect
wages in the directions expected, namely, higher skill level, working in a formal job, and being male all
contribute positively to hourly wage. Age also plays a role, increasing wage to a certain point and falling
thereafter. While the impact of skill level and formality on hourly wage has fallen from 2009 to 2011, the
impact of gender as a determinant of wage has increased. This may be attributable, in part, to a surge in
construction jobs, which generally employs unskilled and semi-skilled workers (See Table 6).

This corroborates the evidence presented in the mobility analysis, highlighting the importance
of labor income in pushing people out of poverty. As the characteristics of those who earn more are
generally consistent with the characteristics of those who escaped poverty, there is, not surprisingly, a
clear link between wage earnings and the ability to escape poverty. The one difference between the two
analyses refers to the substantial impact of skill level in determining wages (vis-à-vis the levels of
education in households exiting from poverty). The evidence here confirms the strong, positive impact
of education on wages, and substantiates the hypothesis that the reason that the more educated poor
exhibit lower economic mobility is linked to dimensions beyond skill level making these people poor
regardless of their level of education rather than the unlikely outcomes that their low mobility is
attributable to higher educational attainment.

The skill premium continues to be, on average, slightly higher in Pernambuco than in Brazil,
although it has declined faster in the state than in the country. In Pernambuco, skilled workers
(those with ensino medio or a higher level of education) earn, on average, 3.7 times the rate of unskilled
workers (those with less than ensino fundamental or primary school). The equivalent ratio for Brazil as a
whole is 3.1. From their level in 2009, these figures represent a decrease in the skill premium of 14.3
percent and 13 percent for Pernambuco and Brazil, respectively, as hourly wages grew faster for
unskilled workers than for skilled workers between 2009 and 2011. The higher skill premium in
Pernambuco is likely related to the fact that there are less skilled workers as a percentage of the
population in Pernambuco (38.8 percent) than in Brazil (42.5 percent). Semi-skilled workers (complete
ensino fundamental) experienced the largest increase in hourly wages over this period in Pernambuco, at an
over 27 percent annualized growth rate. This may be related to the recent uptake in construction which
may not be sustainable going forward; however, higher wage rates for traditionally marginalized people
(taking education as a proxy for marginalization) has positive implications for declines in income
inequality. On the other hand, if the decline in the skill premium is driven by expansion of education
without focusing on quality or failing to connect education to skills and jobs in the labor market, this
could indicate a dilution of the positive effects of education on productivity.

While the skill premium has decreased, inequality within each skill group has risen between
2001 and 2011. Overall, the Gini based on hourly wages, changed very little between 2001 and 2011.
However, within the unskilled and semi-skilled groups the Gini rose by 0.03; and by 0.05, within the
group of skilled workers. Analyzing the income distribution by skill and age group reveals that workers
aged 40-65 in the skilled group have seen the largest increase in inequality (0.05), while those in the
unskilled and semi-skilled group experienced in 2011 the largest level of inequality (0.61 each). These
levels of inequality may be reflective of territorial returns to labor and sectoral differences—addressed
below.

       7.3      Sectors and mobility

The fastest growing demand for skilled labor in Pernambuco lies in the service sector, while
semi-skilled workers continue to make up the bulk of the full work force.20 This may help explain
why the share of services in the economy was a major pull factor in the migration analysis. Additionally,
demand for skilled labor 21 increased between 2010 and 2011 in every sector, except for water
decontamination (public services)—where net employment for all skill types decreased. By contrast,
employment for unskilled workers fell in three of the five sectors considered, and exhibited more than
one percentage point positive growth for only the mining/industry/construction sector, consistent with
the hypothesis that a construction boom is driving down skill premiums when skills are actually in
demand in all other sectors. These trends indicate that, on one hand, Pernambuco is moving towards
higher productivity sectors, and, on the other, within all sectors, jobs are becoming more skill intensive.
Continued investment in skills acquisition will thus prove to be an essential element of the government’s
strategy in sustaining inclusive growth. Furthermore, it will be important to maintain focus on the

and jobs report to analyze skill usage (proxied by educational attainment) and workers’ transitions in Pernambuco.

quality of skills acquisition (i.e. education) as jobs requiring skilled services may demand more intensive
specialization. For instance, worker transitions are low in services and commerce, both high skill fields.
In Pernambuco, 2.7 percent and 5.7 percent of workers employed in services and commerce,
respectively, worked in another sector in 2011 compared to 2010. By contrast, 8.5 percent of workers in
water decontamination and 7.0 percent of workers in agriculture came from another sector.

8.      The way forward

The analyses reflect that, in line with the state’s policy priorities, Pernambuco has seen positive results in
terms of both economic growth and equity in recent years. Falling poverty and inequality rates
across the state, and social progress within every municipality over the past decade, show that
the state is fulfilling its quality of life objective. The increase in the equitable coverage of
opportunities has shown an impact on living standards and reduced inequalities faced by disadvantaged
                                                                                                                                     41
groups. Continued economic growth, GDP and social welfare convergence among
municipalities corroborates an improvement of territorial equity, in line with the state’s Nova
Economia strategy.

Zooming in at the municipality level, however, the results reveal that the gap between
municipalities may be too large for lagging municipalities to catch up at the current pace of
improvement. The sigma and beta-convergence evidence presented indicates that economic growth is
taking place and it is taking place in lagging municipalities faster, relatively, than in leading ones. The
social diamond analysis also shows equity-focused indicators have improved in all municipalities, and
have improved relatively faster in lagging ones. However, the gap between initially lagging municipalities
and stronger ones in terms of both GDP per capita and the social diamond index has risen. This
indicates that better municipalities in 2000 improved by more over the decade in absolute terms and has
implications for policy makers in terms of strengthening the social welfare focus of the interiorização
policy objective, and prioritizing expenditure, notably through mechanisms such as the Fundo Estuadual
de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Municipal – FEM. This will be particularly important to ensure the
sustainability of the results achieved so far, and to face the challenges that remain in a less favorable
economic context of slower growth and higher inflation.

Lagging municipalities may need an extra push in providing quality access to public goods and
services to overcome initially low levels of social welfare. The divergence between relative and
absolute levels of change observed in municipalities in Pernambuco implies that lagging municipalities
will need to improve at a much faster rate relative to their initial positions than leading municipalities in
order to catch up. Focusing on economic growth alone is not sufficient to close equity gaps across the
state as this could lead to the creation of “convergence clubs”— where some municipalities belong to a
group that enjoys capacity and uses resources well, while others grow economically but lag behind in the
capacity to provide services (see Quah 1995). Because municipalities with higher initial starting points of
social welfare can devote fewer resources/capacity to short-term necessities—such as income transfers
to alleviate monetary poverty—they can focus more on building infrastructure and strengthening
peoples’ non-monetary endowments. Municipalities with initially lower levels of social welfare have
multiple issues to address, and thus, may need a bigger push, monetarily and in terms of capabilities, to
deal with issues that are not short-term such as quality education and public infrastructure projects.
Because of this virtuous circle of shared prosperity, such a push could have large payoffs. However,
rather than concentrating solely in terms of increasing resources, these efforts could focus more on
building up technical capacity—as translating resources into results appears to pose more challenges
than access to resources in and of itself. For instance, the amount of Bolsa Familia resources distributed
to the Northeast surged from 3 billion reais in 2005 to 10.9 billion in 2012 (the next highest region, the
Southeast, received less than half this amount in 2012), growing at more than double the rate of
transfers to municipal governments in the Northeast through Fundo de Participação dos Municípios (FPM).
At the same time, the value of FPM transfers to the Northeast was higher than any other region in
2012.22 Thus, the Northeast is receiving considerable financial support through different mechanisms,

                                                                                                          42
but to translate this support effectively and efficiently into further grains in poverty and equity and
progress on Bolsa Familia goals, municipal capacity is and will be critical.

Focusing on improving endowments allows people to maximize their own welfare as well as the
state’s. In addition to focusing on endowments in human and physical capital—for instance, through
the provision of services to improve education and health—policy-makers can also influence outcomes
(employment or income levels) by providing subsidies or by creating conditions conducive to an
appropriate business environment. Regional development strategies often combine the two types of
interventions. Skoufias and Katayama (2009) present evidence that in Brazil, policies aimed at affecting
outcomes (e.g. directing the location of investment through tax subsidies) tend to be less cost-effective
than policies that focus on endowments. Investing in endowments and establishing the conditions that
lead to an endogenous redistribution of economic opportunities (e.g. investing in human capital and
infrastructure) tends to be more cost effective as people are able to migrate to thriving areas (supporting
the evidence of agglomeration effects—economies of scale and networks).

Indeed, the results from the gravity model reflect that the main economic poles continue to
offset other forces and attract population. Focusing on returns may therefore indicate an inefficient
use of resources, which could be used instead to address the circumstances forcing people to migrate
such as high inequality and extreme poverty, or those preventing them from migrating such as illiteracy. As
people become free from poverty traps, they are able to choose the best place suited for their skills. By
focusing on human and physical capital (infrastructure, services, quality of services), equity is directly
addressed, whereas focusing on returns provides a less efficient path to achieve both economic growth
(due to the weakening of agglomeration effects within the state) and social welfare (as it is addressed
only indirectly). Increased horizontal equity can contribute to sustainable pockets of economic growth
throughout the state, leading to increased economic mobility, activity and revenues, sustaining the
virtuous cycle of shared prosperity. To promote this, the state can support well-functioning labor
markets by continuing efforts to endow people with high-productivity skills. It can also ensure that fiscal
policy focuses expenditures more on endowments than on returns. The importance of using resources
as efficiently as possible is clear within the context of sustainable fiscal management.

The improvement of skills and productivity across the different sectors of Pernambuco’s labor
markets, formal and informal, will be key in maintaining and deepening the reduction of
poverty and inequality. Labor income has played a critical role in reducing both poverty and inequality
in the state. Within the macro context of slower growth in Brazil, investment in high productivity skills
and jobs will make up a key dimension in the state’s continued convergence with the rest of the country.
Evidence from the labor analysis indicates that demand for skilled labor is indeed increasing in
Pernambuco. While the skill premium is decreasing—which could be due to increases in the supply
side—it continues to be the main determinate of wage in Pernambuco. In this sense, providing quality
services to lift human capital levels as well as ensuring that markets are well-functioning to match these
skills, will contribute to economic growth and sustainability—both in support of the Nova Economia
policy priority as well as in poverty reduction, through increased income. Continuing to redistribute
human capital, infrastructure, and supporting the poorest municipalities, especially in terms of capacity
building, will contribute to increased equity. To expand the progress to date in the interiorização objective,
                                                                                                           43
it will be necessary to focus on improving endowments to the interior of the state, with added attention
to issues such as gender and ethnicity to promote the agency of all pernambucanos and their ability to
benefit and contribute to their state’s development.

    Annex 2: Income mobility with synthetic panels

    Income mobility analysis using the methodology developed by Dang, Lanjouw, Luoto, and
    McKenzie (2011).
           Two rounds of cross-sectional data (PNAD 2003 and 2011)
    Using the second round, the relationship between income and invariant household characteristics is
    modeled using OLS and the income is estimated for round 1 with the resulting coefficients as
    follows :

                    ̂        ̂         ̂ where perfect positive correlationof the error term is assumed
                     to establish the lower bound
    This yields incomes for both periods, one real, the other estimated, to tack households movements
    in and out of poverty. E.g., the probability of a household who was poor in period 1 to escape
    poverty by period 2 where p is the poverty line:
                         (̂      |         )
    This approach has been validated in a recent paper by Cruces et al. (2011) in the context of Latin
    America




    Annex 3: Constructing diamonds of social progress


                                                                                                                53
 To construct the diamond of social progress, 4 aspects of social welfare are taken into account and
 placed on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 standing for the socially optimal outcome:
          Human Opportunity Index: H = HOI
          Positive gap of deprivations: PGD =                (Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index)
                o where d is the average number of deprivations out of the 6 considered
          Gini complement: GC = 1- Gini (income inequality)
          Absence of extreme poverty: AEP = 1- poverty headcount (70 reais)
 These dimensions are then used to calculate the area of the diamond with multi-dimensional
 measures alternating with income measures to give:
                     (    ) (           )
                                           , where the maximum area (socially optimal) of the diamond is 2




Annex 4: Gravity model of migration

The gravity model of migration is similar to that used by Soloaga and Lara to study push and pull
factors of migration between Mexican states and municipalities
It uses OLS regression to determine the factors (X) of importance that are driving immigration from
origin to destination municipalities:

                   (                    )                                               , where o is the
                 origin, d is the destination, and k is distance
The coefficients of the origin and destination characteristics are then interpreted to determine
whether they are attractive or repellant factors for migrants:
                                (                  )                                 (                )
           Origin:                                        Destination:
                                    (              )                             (                    )



                                                                                                              54
Annex 5: Human Opportunity Index (Geometric Means)

The Human Opportunity Index (HOI), proposed by Barros, Ferreira, Vega, and Chanduvi (2009) in
the context of LAC, is a measure of the equitable coverage of basic goods and services
(“opportunities”) which support human development such as access to water and sanitation, child
school enrollment, and possession of a telephone or refrigerator. Coverage of “opportunities” is
adjusted for the equity of distribution across “circumstance” groups which are constructed based on
characteristics out of an individual’s control such as gender, race, location of birth, and parental level
of education. Because children are less likely to have control of these characteristics, the HOI is
calculated using individuals aged between 0 and 16 years old.
Following Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2012)’s construction of a distribution-sensitive human
development index, the HOI calculated in this report utilizes geometric means to adjust coverage in
access to goods and services to account for differences in distribution. The value of this approach
vis-à-vis the construction of a dissimilarity index (“D-index”) and corresponding penalty for unequal
distribution (as in Barros, Ferreira, Vega, and Chanduvi (2009) is that it is not path-dependent.


To calculate the HOI using geometric means requires three steps:
    1) Calculate the (simple average) mean access rate (% of people with coverage) for each
       opportunity by circumstance group (a group is composed of all of the people with the
       same set of circumstances. eg, group 1 could be comprised of all female who are afro-
       descendant live in rural locations and whose household head has an elementary school level
       of education)

                                        ∑

    2) Take the population weighted geometric mean of the average access rates for each
       opportunity. The result is the HOI for each opportunity.

                                                      [∏(              )]

        Alternatively, this equation can be written as:

                                                     [ ∑           (         )]

    3) To construct the composite index, take the geometric mean of the HOIs found in step
       2.
                                                    [ ∑        (            )]


To compare the HOI to coverage rates alone, take the difference between the arithmetic mean of
coverage for an opportunity for the population less the HOI for the opportunity.


                                                                                                             55
