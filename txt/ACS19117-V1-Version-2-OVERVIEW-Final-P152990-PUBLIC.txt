Mathematics Education
 in Sub-Saharan Africa:
     Status, Challenges,
     and Opportunities
            Overview Report
This overview report summarises the findings of the study Mathematics
Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Status, Challenges, and Opportunities.


The study was commissioned by the World Bank in response to a
growing recognition that countries in the region will need to boost
performance significantly in the Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics subjects if they are to realise their full potential in a
competitive global market increasingly shaped by the use of new
technologies. The findings of the study will be used to support the
efforts of the World Bank, and its partners, to improve mathematics
education across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and in other developing
economies where similar challenges are faced.

   Box 1   Strengthening initial teacher training through use of open
           
           educational resources

   The Open University, UK working in close collaboration with international and national
   partners, guides The Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) initiative - a
   network of teacher educators and teachers working to improve the quality of classroom
   practice across SSA. Its focus is on supporting school-based teacher education through
   providing unrestricted access to a large bank of Open Educational Resources (OER)
   including: general teaching resources; subject-specific resources including teaching
   packs; audio clips; and, handbooks for teachers and teacher educators. The materials,
   prepared and/or adapted by African authors, are designed to enhance the training of
   teachers both pre-service and in-service. They are currently available in four languages -
   English, French, Kiswahili (Tanzania) and Arabic (Sudan) – and can be accessed at:
   http://www.tessafrica.net/.

   One of the key strengths of the TESSA approach is the flexibility offered by using OER
   which can be used as they are or modified to meet specific needs and/or country-specific
   contexts. Ministries of Education, Institutions of Higher Education, and TTIs can, if they
   wish, join the TESSA network for support or they can simply ‘plunder’ the available
   resources to build or enhance their own teacher training modules.

   Following the success of the TESSA initiative in SSA, the model has now been adapted for
   India (see http://www.open.ac.uk/about/international-development/ido-asia/TESS-India).

    Box 2	               support for mathematics teachers
      
    In 2014, the Department of Basic Education in South Africa announced that the professional
    development of mathematics teachers will follow a ‘1+4 model’. Under this model, one day
    is used to prepare teachers in delivering the curriculum content to be delivered to senior
    classes in the remaining four days of the school week. On the training day, the teachers
    meet in a local school where a designated Lead Teacher presents the content and
    recommended teaching strategies for the following four days. The training day is highly
    structured and teachers are tested to ensure that they have mastered the content. Teachers
    who fail to demonstrate mastery will be supported during the week by a ‘support team’.
    This radical approach provides each mathematics teacher with 23 days per year of intensive
    training and regular opportunities to discuss mathematics content and methodology. The
    1+4 development model clearly has significant implications for the organisation of school
    timetables but it exhibits three of the key characteristics associated with effective in-service
    training: training sessions are frequent and sustained over time; training forms part of a
    formal CPD programme; and, peer-to-peer support is a prominent feature.

             The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India commissions
             and publishes physical textbooks for use in schools on a commercial basis. However, it also
             makes e-versions freely available to individuals provided that these are not offered for resale.
             The books, and supplementary learning materials, are available through the e-portal at:
             http://epathshala.nic.in/e-pathshala-4/. They are available in Hindi, English and, in some
             cases, Urdu. They are available in formats suitable for download to mobile devices and PCs.
             There is, as yet, little data on the use of these resources but the principle of allowing free
             access to TLMs produced with the support of the state is sound. The potential advantages of
             such a system in the context of SSA are significant. For example, tutors in TTIs and their
             trainees would have access to the curricula and textbooks being used in schools; serving
             teachers would have free access to textbooks in multiple languages when preparing their
             lessons; and students fortunate enough to have access to the internet would have free
             access to textbooks and other materials for self-tuition.

    In the Philippines, the Text2Teach programme allows teachers to download web-based TLM
    to their mobile phones. These generally take the form of short instructional videos and
    teacher guides on Mathematics, Science, and English language for Grade 5 and Grade 6
    students. Videos can be used with the whole class by connecting the mobile phone to a
    projector television. Following successful large-scale trials and positive evaluation results,
    the Department of Education (in collaboration with its commercial partners, Microsoft, the
    Pearson Foundation and the mobile network provider Globe Telecom) is rolling out the
    Text2Teach programme to all 22,000 of the nation’s elementary schools from 2015.
    Text2Teach emanates from the BridgeIT Project initiated by commercial partners Nokia and
    Pearson. BridgeIT operates in many low-income countries including Tanzania where the
    programme is known as Elimu kwa Teknolojia (Education through Technology). The
    subjects covered include Mathematics, Science, and Life Skills. Existing content was
    translated into Kiswahili and additional content was generated to ensure coverage of the
    national curricula. An evaluation of the programme’s impact on student test scores in
    mathematics found that those in classes where the technology had been used had made
    more progress than their peers in the control group. The reported differences were
    relatively modest but nevertheless significant with score improvements ranging from about
    8 to 17 percentage points for the two age groups studied (Enge, 2011).

The two regional assessments - SACMEQ and
PASEC - have over the years become
increasingly sophisticated and have aligned to a
significant extent the technical procedures and
standards they use. This convergence has made
them potentially more powerful both
independently and in collaboration. SACMEQ
and PASEC should strengthen their existing
links through formal agreements, the adoption
of common operating standards, and the use of
a common (linked) reporting scale. This would
move SSA towards a pan-African comparative
assessment programme capable of measuring
student achievement and monitoring trends
over time. Countries which do not yet take part
in SACMEQ and PASEC studies should be
encouraged to do so through, for example,
financial support and technical assistance from
international agencies.
