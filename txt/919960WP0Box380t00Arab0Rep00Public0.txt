THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Social insurance provides compensation for disability, retirement
        (pension), unemployment, and work-related injuries. By law, employers
        are required to subscribe to the social insurance system. Otherwise,
        they may be subject to sanctions.

        The following documents must be submitted to the competent
        authority’s office:

        Company’s commercial register.

        insurance number; or Form No. 6 for clearance/termination from
        employees’ previous jobs.

        The company premises are then subject to inspection by relevant
        authorities - such as the National Authority for Social Insurance and
        GAFI. Inspection takes place in practice only if there is any complaint
        filed against the company, or suspicion that the company is an image
        organization that does not actually conduct business as claimed in its
        submitted documents. Companies registering for sales tax will undergo
        inspection.

      Technicians review the request and determine which distribution network

      A SCEDC electrical engineer will inspect the site. If the review concludes
      that a special room is needed for an electrical generator, it is the client’s
      responsibility to build such a room. The purpose of the inspection is to
      check whether there is enough capacity to provide the power needed
      and whether the property has any specific requirements. The client does
      not have to be present at the inspection.

      No inspection of the entire internal wiring is carried out during the

        The client obtains external works from South Cairo Electricity

        External works can start when the client has paid the connection fees at
        the utility’s cashier and submitted the excavation permit to the utility.
        For loads below 500 kVA, the customer does not need to buy or pay for
        any material required for the external works or connection. Thus,

        a substation is needed, the customer will be asked to build the room .
        A substation in this case is not needed. External works in this case consist
        of laying out underground cables to the closest point of supply.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
