2   Strengthening Kazakhstan’s Education System:




Executive                      Summary
Kazakhstan’s PISA1 2012 performance improved markedly compared to 2009, and indicated
a narrowing achievement gap among students. Math and science performance improvements
equivalent to more than half a year of schooling were achieved. According to the OECD, 40 points in PISA
is equivalent to what students learn in one year of schooling. The improvements reduced the gap with other
countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) by almost half. Moreover, the performance improvements of
the lowest achievers in 2009 and 2012 outpaced those of their higher achieving peers at a rate that compares
favorably against OECD countries. However, performance on reading improved only marginally and overall
reading achievement remained low, with some groups of students actually performing worse in 2012.

Kazakhstan’s PISA performance places it significantly behind other countries, especially in
reading. Countries with income per capita levels similar to Kazakhstan’s (namely Turkey and Russia)
performed significantly better in math, science, and reading. Most importantly, Kazakh reading scores still
lag about one year of schooling behind the ECA average and almost two years of schooling behind OECD.
Public expenditures on education are lowest in Kazakhstan compared with other PISA 2012 participating
countries, which likely hampers the country’s ability to ensure effective learning for all. Any increase in
public spending on education will have to be aligned with careful policy reform decision making, since
resources alone do not guarantee attainment of desired education outcomes.

For every improvement in PISA performance, Kazakhstan took one step back. Despite
improvements in math and science, reading achievement suffered. A more in-depth look at country
performance across groups reveals a series of challenges that need to be addressed in the short term.
Although performance in reading remains the major challenge for Kazakhstan, achievement disparities
across all three subjects will require the attention of policy makers with respect to resource allocation,
human resource deployment, and policies in the near future. Special emphasis needs to be placed on:

1		Boys’ reading: Although there is no gender disparity in math or science performance, girls perform
    better than boys by the equivalent of one full year of schooling in reading.

2		Low socioeconomic status (SES) students: A gap equivalent to 1.5 years of schooling exists
    between students from families in the highest and lowest socioeconomic quintiles.

3		Kazakh language schools:2 Students at Russian language schools perform the equivalent of 1.5
    years higher in reading and one year higher in math than peers attending Kazakh language schools.

4		Professional school (technical vocational education, or TVE, lyceum) students: Students
    in professional schools are behind their peers in basic and general secondary schools and colleges by
    more than 1.5 years of schooling in reading and one year of schooling in math.

5		    azakh language spoken at home: Students from households where Russian is spoken
      K
      performed better by about one year of schooling in reading and by about 1.5 years of schooling in math.

An in-depth analysis into math and reading skills shows large variations in performance
compared to other countries. PISA rotates the in-depth assessment of skills by subject area each time it
is administered. PISA 2009 focused on reading, while PISA 2012 focused on math; PISA 2015 will focus on
science. While all three subjects are tested each time, the rotating in-depth assessment of subject-specific
skills allows for the evaluation of content and competency specific skills in each area. In both PISA 2009
and 2012, there was a large variation in achievement across subscale categories compared with other
4   Strengthening Kazakhstan’s Education System:




countries. For math, PISA 2012 shows that students performed relatively better in content skills in algebra
and geometry, but not as well in problems related to data and uncertainty. Moreover, students had difficulty
relating mathematical problems to their real-life contexts and deriving applications of the problems. In
the 2009 PISA in-depth reading assessment, students better understood what PISA calls continuous texts
(such as information presented in a paragraph format) than non-continuous texts (such as information
accompanying a figure or chart). As with math, skill weaknesses demonstrated a disconnect between what
students read and their ability to apply that to real-life situations: in particular, Kazakh students’ learning
strategies (as reported by the PISA students’ questionnaire) showed important gaps relative to those of
students in OECD countries.

The following policy recommendations could be explored to build on the impressive overall
gains made in PISA 2012:

    Ensure that basic reading skills are achieved. Reading performance appears to be the greatest
(i)	
    challenge in Kazakhstan’s education system. Reading is a skill that begins with a solid foundation in
    early grade literacy. Rather than waiting for national or international large-scale assessments mostly
    focused on grades 4 and above, teachers should regularly assess early grade literacy in the classroom
    and then intervene with the appropriate combination of pedagogical approaches. Early grade literacy
    is a critical stepping stone for further skills acquisition, and a comprehensive approach that brings
    together teachers’ professional development, learning materials, and assessment tools development is
    necessary. Kazakhstan should consider implementing a program that includes five important steps to
    improve reading in the early grades: (i) train teachers how to teach reading; (ii) maximize instruction
    time in the classroom; (iii) put appropriate books in the hands of children; (iv) implement appropriate
    language policies and provide mother tongue-based instruction; and (v) measure reading skills.

		International evidence shows that the quality of teaching is the most important school-based predictor
   of student learning; thus ensuring teacher effectiveness should be prioritized. Teaching quality is
   affected by many factors, from teachers’ skills to their practices. In Kazakhstan, teachers appear to be
   especially challenged in how they manage assignments and relate knowledge taught to students’ lives.
   In turn, students are disadvantaged by limited knowledge and ineffective learning strategies, such as
   relating new knowledge to other contexts and applying study methods other than memorization. This
   study’s results also found large discrepancies in performance between Russian and Kazakh language
   schools, as well as among regions. While relatively low student performance points to the need to
   enhance teacher effectiveness at the national level, improving the pedagogical skills of teachers in
   Kazakh language schools and underperforming regions should be a priority. Incentive packages to
   ensure that the highest performing teachers are assigned to underperforming schools could also be
   considered.

(ii)	
     Establish a comprehensive Early Childhood Development (ECD) program, with an
     emphasis on at-risk groups. The analysis of the determinants of quality of education concludes that
     unlike in most countries, attending preschool in Kazakhstan has no impact on student achievement
     levels at age 15, controlling for other relevant factors. These results may imply that the quality of
     the preschool system was poor in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In recent years, Kazakhstan has
     allocated considerable resources through the Balapan program to expand access to preschools, but
     the focus has not been on improving quality or ensuring that young children acquire key cognitive
     and non-cognitive skills that serve as the building block for lifelong skills formation. Kazakhstan
     therefore should assess the quality of preschools, either by observing teachers and their effectiveness,
     or by monitoring child development outcomes to ensure that additional investments have the
     intended impact. Recent evidence also suggests that adequate health, nutrition, and stimulation for
     children aged 0-3 are critical for brain development, which also affects skills acquisition. Currently,
     social services for children in the age groups 0-3 and 4-6 are not well coordinated. An effective ECD
     program should therefore integrate health and social services for children aged 0-3, while ensuring
     a smooth transition to quality preschool programs and then primary school readiness. The return
     on investments in ECD is highest for at-risk children and their families, thus in a context of limited
     resources, a targeted approach is recommended.

      Develop an integrated assessment system. An integrated assessment system should ensure that
(iii)	
      student assessments reflect the content of the curriculum and are objective and fair, and that results
      are provided in a way that supports the system to identify areas where further research or remedial
      action is needed. While the PISA results present a good starting point to discuss education reform,
      there are limits to the conclusions that can be drawn. For example, PISA is a competency-based, rather
      than a curriculum-based, assessment. There are thus limitations to the data and some information
      gaps are evident in the determinants analysis, especially for understanding the factors driving the
      improvements in math and science scores. Summative national student assessments, conducted at key
      milestone grades, could be reformed to collect data on the missing variables. Interim and formative
      assessments are also necessary to assess student progress with respect to the curriculum or to drill
      down deeper on mastery of a specific skill. Education policy makers may wish to consider not only
      results from international student assessments such as PISA but also national assessments at various
      levels. The results from this report will hopefully contribute to the ongoing debate about student
      assessment system reform in Kazakhstan.

Education and skills are critical for the development of countries and individuals. International
evidence suggests that quality of education is one of the most important determinants of long-term economic
growth.3 Hanushek and Woessmann (2007 and 2010) looked at a wide range of student assessment surveys
from 1960 onward, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the Progress in International Reading Literacy
Study (PIRLS). They estimated that an improvement of 50 points in PISA scores would imply an increase of 1
percentage point in the annual growth rate of GDP per capita.4 Beyond economic growth, education improves
the living standards of individuals, as those with more education are able to acquire higher-order skills,
making them more productive and employable, and extending their labor market participation over their
lifetime. These factors lead to higher earnings and a better quality of life. Formal schooling also contributes
to development of behavioral skills like longer attention span, motivation, self-confidence, and physical and
emotional health, all important determinants of socioeconomic mobility. Education is a key ingredient for
reducing inequality and increasing shared prosperity. Understanding the determinants of education quality
can play an important role in shaping effective evidence-based education policy. The PISA database is a great
resource in the pursuit of this analysis.

PISA is a tool for measuring education quality across countries. Introduced in 2000 by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), PISA is a worldwide study of 15-year-old school
students’ performance in three different disciplines: mathematics, science, and reading. PISA is administered
every three years and focuses on the competence of students and their ability to tackle real-life problems in the
three disciplines and emphasizes skills that are critical for individuals’ personal and professional development.
PISA only assesses students who are enrolled in school, making it the most realistic, and internationally
comparable, snapshot of a country’s education system. However, if dropout rates are high, the results may not
be representative of a country’s cohort of 15-year-olds. PISA’s scoring system is standardized so that the mean
score for each discipline among OECD countries in year 2000 is 500 points, with a standard deviation of 100
points. According to the OECD, 40 points in PISA is equivalent to what students learn in one year of schooling.5
Kazakhstan’s education system (see Box 1) was assessed in the two most recent PISA rounds of 2009 and 2012.
Kazakhstan’s participation in PISA allows us to benchmark its performance with other countries, measure the
extent of the country’s success in promoting education quality, and gauge whether system inequities have been
reduced over time.

Kazakhstan’s PISA 2012 performance in math and science is a marked improvement above 2009
levels (Figure 1). Since 40 points are equivalent to one year of schooling, the math and science gains were each
equivalent to more than half a year of schooling. Performance in reading improved marginally by 3 points,
remaining at quite low levels. On average, significant changes tend to be observed only in score comparisons
exceeding 10 points; thus the limited improvement in reading is within the margin of error. International
comparisons aside, Kazakhstan has achieved significant performance gains in math and science since its first
assessment in 2009.
8      Strengthening Kazakhstan’s Education System:




    Box 1 kazakhstan’s education system




    Kazakhstan has a population of 17.2 million people, with Kazakhs comprising 64 percent of the
    population and Russians 23 percent. Other ethnic groups include Uzbeks, Ukrainians, and Uyghurs.
    The education system serves more than 4.5 million students from the pre-primary level through
    tertiary education. According to UN estimates, Kazakhstan’s school-age population is projected
    to grow by more than 20 percent between 2015 and 2030, reflecting the impact of high fertility and
    low emigration.

    Primary education is the first stage of compulsory education and spans a period of four years.
    The majority of children enroll at age seven, but six-year-olds can be admitted by passing
    an entrance test. Secondary education starts at fifth grade and consists of two levels: basic
    comprehensive (grades 5-9) and senior comprehensive (grades 10-11). After basic comprehensive,
    students can continue to senior comprehensive for two more years or enter technical vocational
    schools (colleges) for three years of study. After completing secondary education, students may
    progress to higher education institutes and universities.

Expenditures in education

Although Kazakhstan’s level of public expenditure per student is low relative to other countries in
ECA, this doesn’t fully explain its low PISA performance (Figure 5). Kazakhstan spends the lowest amount
on education per pupil among the ECA countries that participated in PISA 2012, even though the country’s
GDP per capita is close to the ECA average. Expenditure per pupil in Kazakhstan is equivalent to 11.7 percent of
GDP per capita, much lower than that of PISA top performers like Poland (23.9 percent), Japan (22.8 percent),
Switzerland (27.1 percent), and Estonia (25.8 percent). Other upper-middle-income countries with similar
economic development indicators, like Chile (15.3 percent) and Malaysia (19.1 percent), also devote more
national resources than Kazakhstan. To ensure high quality provision of education, a minimum level of financial
resources in education is necessary. However, higher levels of expenditures do not necessarily imply better
learning outcomes. Countries like Poland or Estonia devote less per student compared to countries with similar
economic development, but manage to ensure that the vast majority of students are well prepared in literacy and
numeracy skills by the end of their secondary education. While a causal link between public expenditure per
pupil and improved education outcomes is not a certainty, Kazakhstan’s low expenditure per pupil should be
reconsidered, particularly given the country’s aim to rank among the world’s high-income countries by 2030.

PISA offers the opportunity to fully explore one subject area every three years, even though all
three subjects are assessed every time PISA is administered. PISA seeks to assess not merely whether
students can reproduce knowledge, but also how well they can extrapolate from what they have learned and
apply it in unfamiliar settings, both within and outside the school. The detailed test of “subscale” skills of
a given subject area is an in-depth assessment with a larger set of questions. The detailed assessment was
focused on reading in 2000 and 2009, on math in 2003 and 2012, and on science in 2006. The 2015 round will
focus again on science.

Math skills in PISA 2012
The PISA math 2012 subscale assessment measured individuals’ abilities to formulate, employ,
and interpret mathematics in a variety of contexts and content areas. In PISA, the concept of
mathematical literacy includes: (i) mathematical reasoning; (ii) usage of mathematical concepts, procedures,
and facts; (iii) tools to describe, explain, and predict phenomena; and (iv) the role that mathematics plays in
the world and the need to make well-founded judgments and decisions needed by constructive, engaged, and
reflective citizens. Furthermore, mathematic literacy as defined by PISA is not an attribute that an individual
has or does not have; rather, it can be acquired to a greater or lesser extent, and it is required in varying degrees
in society. The questions faced by students are framed in four real-world context categories: Personal, Societal,
Occupational, and Scientific.

The PISA math framework is a sophisticated tool for connecting students’ mastery of mathematical
processes and contents. The math subscale assessment evaluates capacity in four content categories
(Figure 16): quantity (incorporates the quantification of attributes of objects, relationships, situations, and
entities); uncertainty and data (understanding messages embedded in data, and appreciating the variability
inherent in many real processes); change and relationships (temporary and permanent relations among objects
and circumstances); and space and shape (phenomena encountered in patterns, object properties, positions,
representations, visual information, navigation, and dynamic interactions). Figure 16 also shows a schematic
of the stages faced by a student when solving a real-life problem through the mathematical modelling cycle.
The action begins with identifying the problem in context and finishes when the results of the problem are
found in a context and again are reflected in the problem context. This process involves four skills that PISA
defines as “processes,” assessed in 2012 as: formulate a mathematical situation according to the concepts and
relationships identified; employ mathematical facts, procedures, and reasoning to obtain results (usually
involving calculation, manipulation, and computation); interpret the results in terms of the original problem to
obtain the “results in context”; and finally, evaluate the outcomes and their reasonableness in the context of the
problem.13

4.       Findings
         recommendations
                         &
The following policy recommendations could be explored to build on the impressive overall
gains made in PISA 2012:

(i)	    nsure that basic reading skills are achieved. Reading performance appears to be the greatest
       E
       challenge in Kazakhstan’s education system. Reading is a skill that begins with a solid foundation in
       early grade literacy. Rather than waiting for national or international large-scale assessments mostly
       focused on grades 4 and above, teachers should regularly assess early grade literacy in the classroom
       and then intervene with the appropriate combination of pedagogical approaches. Early grade literacy
       is a critical stepping stone for further skills acquisition, and a comprehensive approach that brings
       together teachers’ professional development, learning materials, and assessment tools development is
       necessary. Kazakhstan should consider implementing a program that includes five important steps to
       improve reading in the early grades: (i) train teachers how to teach reading; (ii) maximize instruction
       time in the classroom; (iii) put appropriate books in the hands of children; (iv) implement appropriate
       language policies and provide mother tongue-based instruction; and (v) measure reading skills.

		International evidence shows that the quality of teaching is the most important school-based predictor
   of student learning; thus ensuring teacher effectiveness should be prioritized. Teaching quality is
   affected by many factors, from teachers’ skills to their practices. In Kazakhstan, teachers appear to
   be especially challenged in how they manage assignments and relate knowledge taught to students’
   lives. In turn, students are disadvantaged by limited knowledge and application of effective learning
   strategies, such as relating new knowledge to other contexts and applying study methods other than
   memorization. This study’s results also found large discrepancies in performance between Russian
   and Kazakh language schools, as well as among regions. While relatively low student performance
   points to the need to enhance teacher effectiveness at the national level, improving the pedagogical

      skills of teachers in Kazakh language schools and underperforming regions should be a priority.
      Incentive packages to ensure that the highest performing teachers are assigned to underperforming
      schools could also be considered.

(ii)	
     Establish a comprehensive Early Childhood Development (ECD) program, with an
     emphasis on at-risk groups. The analysis of the determinants of quality of education concludes that
     unlike in most countries, attending preschool in Kazakhstan has no impact on student achievement
     levels at age 15, controlling for other relevant factors. These results may imply that the quality of
     the preschool system was poor in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In recent years, Kazakhstan has
     allocated considerable resources through the Balapan program to expand access to preschools, but
     the focus has not been on improving quality or ensuring that young children acquire key cognitive
     and non-cognitive skills that serve as the building block for lifelong skills formation. Kazakhstan
     therefore should assess the quality of preschools, either by observing teachers and their effectiveness,
     or by monitoring child development outcomes to ensure that additional investments have the
     intended impact. Recent evidence also suggests that adequate health, nutrition, and stimulation for
     children aged 0-3 are critical for brain development, which also affects skills acquisition. Currently,
     social services for children in the age groups 0-3 and 4-6 are not well coordinated. An effective ECD
     program should therefore integrate health and social services for children aged 0-3, while ensuring
     a smooth transition to quality preschool programs and then primary school readiness. The return
     on investments in ECD is highest for at-risk children and their families, thus in a context of limited
     resources, a targeted approach is recommended.

      Develop an integrated assessment system. An integrated assessment system should ensure that
(iii)	
      student assessments reflect the content of the curriculum and are objective and fair, and that results
      are provided in a way that supports the system to identify areas where further research or remedial
      action might be needed. While the PISA results present a good starting point to discuss education
      reform, there are limits to the conclusions that can be drawn. For example, PISA is a competency-
      based, rather than a curriculum-based, assessment. There are thus limitations to the data and some
      information gaps are evident in the determinants analysis, especially for understanding the factors
      driving the improvements in math and science scores. Summative national student assessments,
      conducted at key milestone grades, could be reformed to collect data on the missing variables.
      Interim and formative assessments are also necessary to assess student progress with respect to the
      curriculum or to drill down deeper on mastery of a specific skill. Education policy makers may wish
      to consider not only results from international student assessments such as PISA but also national
      assessments at various levels. The results from this report will hopefully contribute to the ongoing
      debate about student assessment system reform in Kazakhstan.

   RIF-Regressions:
Empirical Strategy and Results
The analytical approach used in Section 2 is based on the Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) methodology.
Usually, the literature of decomposition of student scores in PISA through groups (Amermueller 2004)
and years (Barrera et al. 2011) has focused at the mean differences, with little attention to what happens at
the tails of the distribution. The Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (FFL) allows student gap performance to be
decomposed not only for the mean but also for other statistics of the distribution. Traditionally, the problem
with quantile regressions has been that the law of iterated expectations does not apply, thus making it
impossible to interpret the unconditional marginal effect of each independent variable on the student.
However, recent econometric techniques such as the one proposed by FFL have solved this methodological
difficulty. The FFL technique is based on the construction of re-centered influence functions (RIF) of a
quantile of interest, , as a dependent variable in a regression:


                                                            ⌧ − D(I  q⌧ ))
                 RIF (I ; q⌧ ) = q⌧ +
                                                                f I ( q⌧ )
where is an indicator function and is the density of the marginal distribution of scores. A crucial
characteristic of this technique is that it provides a simple way of interpreting the marginal impact of an
additional unit of a certain factor on a student’s PISA scores. Once the unconditional quantile regression has
been computed for different quantiles of the distribution, the results are decomposed following the Oaxaca-
Blinder approach.
