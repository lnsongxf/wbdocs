I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Mexico perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Mexico
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Mexico
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April 2016 to June 2016, 488 stakeholders of the WBG in Mexico were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a Secretary;
office of Congressman; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units (PMUs)
overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 164 stakeholders participated in the survey
(34% response rate).

All respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Mexico; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness
and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s
future role in Mexico; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate was 48%, N=191). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and D. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 86).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President and the Office of
        Secretary were combined. Respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
        combined with those from private sector organizations. Respondents from private
        foundations and NGOs/CBOs were combined into the “CSO” category. Few respondents
        from bilateral/multilateral agencies and other organizations were included in the “Other”
        category. There were no respondents from the office of Congressman, media, trade
        unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, or the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’14 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 7.9; weighted mean in FY’14 = 7.6)1.
       In this year’s survey, respondents from CSOs and academia were significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than other stakeholder groups.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mexico, and the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Mexico, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with the extent to which the WBG helps to achieve development results in the
        country.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Mexico, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Mexico. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Mexico, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year17
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2014 appendices.

FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 138  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 158

By weighting, the FY 2014 data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2016. Therefore, the
two years are comparable. Respondents from the office of congressman (called the office of a
parliamentarian in FY14), multilateral agency, media, community based organizations, trade unions,
faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch were not included in the year comparison
analysis, because there were no respondents from the office of congressman, media, or youth groups in
FY 2016 and no respondents from the office of the President, multilateral agency, or community based
organizations in FY 2014. There were no respondents from trade unions or faith-based groups in neither
years. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
