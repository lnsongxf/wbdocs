(RPBA) was undertaken by the Federal Government of the Republic

ernments of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe.

am Masha, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Internally

Maurice Vunobolki (Adamawa); Mohammed Aminu Ibrahim (Bau-
chi); Dr. Baba Gana Umara (Borno); Aliyu M. Kamara (Gombe); Jeji
Williams (Taraba); and Muhammad Yusufari (Yobe).

The strong support and the contributions of the many different
national stakeholders was remarkable. The dedication of the RPBA
teams from the Federal and State Governments and three institutions

ments, the EU, UN and WB, and the United Kingdom’s Department

2.2.1 Needs for Peace Building, Stability, and
Social Cohesion
The total needs for promoting peace building, stability, and social
cohesion in Bauchi State are estimated at around US$ 23.9 million.
Under this component, social needs in Bauchi are greatest in the sub-
components of ‘local governance and citizen engagement’ and ‘safe
and voluntarily return and resettlement of displaced persons’, at US$
8.8 million and US$ 8.6 million respectively. It is important to note
that basic humanitarian needs for the safe and voluntary return/ reset-
tlement of IDPs, such as housing, service delivery, and livelihood sup-
port are accounted for in the other areas of intervention. The peace
building and social cohesion needs not accounted for in other areas
of intervention relate to the restitution of the social tissue, reconcilia-
tion, and peace building, restoration of a sense of normalcy and needs
of particularly vulnerable sub-groups of IDPs. Addressing the needs
in a holistic and integrated manner is critical for sustainable recovery
and is seen as a precondition for stability and key for sustainable re-
covery. Many issues addressed in peace building, stability, and social
cohesion — and the recommended interventions — are precondi-
tions of future stability and important efforts to overcome Bauchi’s
long-term development challenges.

4.2.1 Needs for Peace Building, Stability, and
Social Cohesion
The total needs for promoting peace building, stability, and social
cohesion in Gombe State are estimated at around US$ 13.6 million.
Host to 30,000 IDPs (as of December 2015), Gombe has major so-
cial needs to support the ‘safe and voluntarily return and resettlement
of displaced persons’, with approximately US$ 5.2 million as the esti-
mated cost for this subcomponent. It is important to note that basic
humanitarian needs for the safe and voluntary return/resettlement
of IDPs such as housing, service delivery, and livelihood support are
accounted for in the other areas of intervention. The peace building,
stability, and social cohesion needs not accounted for in other areas
of intervention relate to the restitution of the social tissue, reconcilia-
tion, and peace building, restoration of a sense of normalcy and needs
of particularly vulnerable sub-groups of IDPs. Addressing the needs
in a holistic and integrated manner is critical for sustainable recovery
and is seen as a precondition for stability and key for sustainable re-
covery. Many issues addressed in peace building and social cohesion
— and the recommended interventions — are preconditions of fu-
ture stability and important efforts to overcome Gombe’s long-term
development challenges.

5.2.1 Needs for Peace Building, Stability, and
Social Cohesion
The total needs for promoting peace building, stability, and social
cohesion in Taraba State are estimated at around US$ 19.1 million.
Home to 50,000 IDPs, Taraba faces the challenge of facilitating the
‘safe and voluntarily return and resettlement of displaced persons, fol-
lowed by promoting ‘local governance and citizen engagement’, with
approximately US$ 7.0 million for each of these two subcomponents.
It is important to note that basic humanitarian needs for the safe
and voluntary return/resettlement of IDPs such as housing, service
delivery and livelihood support are accounted for in the other areas
of intervention. The peace building and social cohesion needs not
accounted for in other areas of intervention relate to the restitution
of the social tissue, reconciliation, and peace building, restoration of
a sense of normalcy and needs of particularly vulnerable sub-groups
of IDPs. Addressing the needs in a holistic and integrated manner
is critical for sustainable recovery and is seen as a precondition for
stability and key for sustainable recovery. Many issues addressed in
peace building, stability, and social cohesion — and the recommend-
ed interventions — are preconditions of future stability and import-
ant efforts to overcome Taraba’s long-term development challenges.

the damages with a loss of US$ 12 million, followed closely by educa-

The North-East has suffered tremendously in the past six years. We have all been witness
to the destruction of infrastructure, farmlands, businesses and trades, of schools and
the loss of school years. Rebuilding, restoring and rehabilitating what has been lost or
damaged will cost money and time.

...the tasks before us are many and profound but paramount: to fix brick and mortar
and to mend hearts and minds damaged by senseless, murderous violence.

            About the Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA):

On 21 August 2015, the Government of Nigeria requested assistance in assessing the needs associated
with peace building and crisis recovery. Support has been provided in accordance with the 2008 Joint
European Union (EU) – United Nations (UN) – World Bank (WB) Declaration on crisis assessment
and recovery planning. A Recovery and Peace Building Assessment was initiated and findings are
presented in this report.

The Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA) informs a collective vision and strategy on peace
building and recovery, and provides a framework for coordinated and coherent support to assist con-
flict-affected people in the North-East. The assessment covers the six States of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa,
Gombe, Taraba, and Bauchi, and provides an overarching framework for stability, peace building, and
recovery.

The RPBA is founded on the recognition that a durable resolution to the conflict in the North-East
requires addressing the structural and underlying drivers of violent conflict. This understanding has
also underpinned the identification and prioritisation of needs presented in this report.
