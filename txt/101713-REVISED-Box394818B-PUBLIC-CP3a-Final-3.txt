a. To ensure a common deflator is used to calculate real growth for all cities and countries, we extract numbers from the Oxford Economics database. However,
for Gaziantep and Tangier, the average annual GDP growth rate and annual job growth rate are available only since 2005; therefore, the numbers reported are
an annual average for 2005–12. For Changsha, the average annual job growth number is for 2003–12.

APPENDIX

Hypotheses for Competitive Cities Case Studies
As noted in the main body of the report, the CCKB team developed and applied a set of standardized research hypoth-
eses to all six successful cities studied. The objective was to ensure the comparability of findings and to enable the
drawing of salient lessons from the findings. The hypotheses are presented below in their entirety.

1.	 City Competitiveness: General or Specific?

    Cities posting exceptional economic performance have made strategic bets on specific industrial
    initiatives, rather than just improving their general investment climate. By specific industrial initia-
    tives, we mean public investments that are geared to the needs of particular growth industries (e.g. industry-spe-
    cific tax and regulations; vocational skills and customized worker training programs; sector-specific infrastruc-
    ture; club goods; investment promotion; etc.). By general investment climate, we mean tax and regulations
    more broadly, basic institutions such as land and housing markets, trunk infrastructure, primary and secondary
    education, and other investments that affect industries more equally. Indeed, some high-performing cities actual-
    ly operated with a rather poor quality overall investment climate.

    A closer look at the components of city economic outcomes reveals the following ingredients of success:


        a.	 Successful cities often have a main “theme” – one area where they particularly excel. Such
            themes can include the presence of a flagship university, an anchor company catalyzing private-sector
            investment, excellence in research/technology commercialization, a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem, or
            exceptionally high degrees of openness to the global economy.
            A focus on developing and/or producing tradable goods and services (rather than non-trad-
            ables). Tradable goods and services are the only way that a city can grow the size of its economic pie,
            while non-tradables such as construction or retail only recirculate existing income.


        b.	 High-performing cities have nurtured not only new investments but also new business
            starts and the growth of existing firms. Cities might enjoy short-term economic success based on
            just one or two of these pillars, but sustained growth over the longer term relies on all three pillars.

2.	 Strategic Planning

    Inflection points in a city’s economic performance over time have been attributable to the specific
    actions/interventions of its policymakers and public officials. Policy interventions have been a critical
    part of changing a city’s development trajectory. Specific characteristics of an impactful strategic planning process
    may include


        a.	 Analytics to inform strategy development:


                •	 benchmarking the city’s economic performance in relation to its competitors; and


                •	 a longitudinal analysis looking at the city’s own past performance


        b.	 A structured planning process to:




                                                                                                           29
              •	 identify key economic development issues the city is facing, such as factors adversely affecting
                 company formation, growth, and attraction, with a particular emphasis on market and coordi-
                 nation failures holding firms back from achieving faster growth;


              •	 identify the city’s main competitive strengths, such as research excellence, human capital, or
                 infrastructure facilities; and


              •	 formulate a vision of progress the city as a whole can make in a certain timeframe, including
                 specific measures to address its problems and capitalize on the city’s competitive strengths. The
                 particular process utilized in each city will be documented.


      c.	 Assembling a “growth coalition” at the city level: Bringing together public sector agencies with di-
          verse external stakeholder groups from civil society, constructively engaging them in the strategic plan-
          ning process both to provide input on key economic development issues, and to come up with suggestions
          for addressing them. Stakeholders engaged in this iterative dialogue can include: relevant public sector
          departments and agencies; universities and other entities with a role in workforce development and tech-
          nology commercialization; private-sector participants elected by each sector (rather than just the “usual
          suspects” or largest incumbents); trade unions and organized labor; NGOs; the media; multipliers; and
          excluded or marginalized social groups (impoverished communities, castes, religious and ethnic commu-
          nities, women).


      d.	 Strategic decision-making and prioritization: A structured process for evaluating policy priorities
          and trade-offs between different public investment alternatives, including credible cost-benefit (or compa-
          rable) analyses.


      e.	 Viable funding mechanisms: Economically successful cities have in place robust mechanisms and
          instruments to finance city-level interventions, including revenue capture and public-private partnerships
          (PPPs).


      f.	 Flexibility and adaptability: The flexibility of the formal (or informal) plan to adapt to changing condi-
          tions is of greater importance than the plan’s original design. Particular attention will been devoted to the
          process by which problems, challenges, and unexpected events are resolved along the way

3.	 Implementation Framework

   The level of autonomy (fiscal/institutional/political) and powers enjoyed by a city government or
   local economic development authority – the “Mayor’s Wedge” – is a significant factor in being able
   to push through interventions resulting in improved economic outcomes. Critical actions include:


      a.	 Having a dedicated economic development agency or department: This entity, tasked specifically
          with achieving strategic economic objectives, is most effective when it has the following:


              •	 Sufficient autonomy (both financial and administrative) from public administration rules and
                 procedures;


              •	 Adequate funding to meet its statutory responsibilities; and


              •	 A well-defined geographical remit (municipal, metropolitan, regional, state/provincial).



30
b.	 Efficient internal management: Successful cities are marked by the following three characteristics of
    internal management:


        •	 Competent teams with clear role designations, reporting structures, and incentives.  
           This includes an ability to solve inter-departmental coordination failures and implementation
           problems;


        •	 An enabling environment that promotes operational efficiency. In particular, effective
           public management systems and structures (PFM, HRM, internal controls, IT Systems, etc.) that
           stand the test of time are essential for getting results;


        •	 A credible performance monitoring and evaluation function. Monitoring and evalua-
           tion, at the heart of well-functioning organizations, is an essential tool to assess implementation
           against objectives, and to continually inform visions, strategies, policies and implementation
           effectiveness, including the following kinds of behaviors and routines: setting goals; prioritization
           among goals; developing policies; evaluation and measurement of performance; and incentive
           structures.


c.	 Private-sector and other stakeholder involvement in implementation: Depending on how devel-
    oped a country’s private sector is, for-profit firms (both indigenous and foreign-owned) can play a highly
    constructive role in implementing a city’s economic development strategy, including through the follow-
    ing:


        •	 Marshaling financial and in-kind resources;


        •	 Integrating local small and medium-sized businesses into multinationals’ global supply chains;


        •	 Enlisting senior corporate leaders to act as the city’s public champions (as a business location) and
           utilize their relationship capital;


        •	 Engaging private-sector firms in workforce development, filling the talent pipeline by collaborat-
           ing with educational institutions to transfer their know-how to younger/future workers, as well as
           to retrain existing labor that may lack the necessary skills;


        •	 Harnessing the efforts of trade unions; and


        •	 Involving other stakeholder groups from the “growth coalition”, as applicable.




                                                                                                   31
