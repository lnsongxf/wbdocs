 	   Political instability is currently perceived by half of Nepalese firms, and in all sectors, as one of the biggest business environment impediments in general. Even though this portion is
     down from 62% in 2009, political instability continues to be the number one reported obstacle to business in Nepal (figure 3). Interestingly, among the firms that participated in both

 	   Oftentimes, using retained earnings to finance capital outlays is a preferable choice by firms as (a) managers retain flexibility and control over their businesses, and (b) internal equity
     tends to be less costly than both external equity and debt financing. However, firms in Nepal have difficulty to generally accumulate retained earnings as they struggle to earn income
     in a consistent way due to political instability and high operational costs. Therefore, their capital structure implies cash deficits instead of sufficient retained earnings, and thus, exposes
     them to serious liquidity problems in case of an economic downturn.

    Over 10% of the large firms still consider labor regulations as a major or very severe obstacle to day-to-day operations compared to 3% of overall SMLEs (Enterprise Survey for Nepal,
    2013, the World Bank).

  	 While the proportion of skilled workers employed in the production process had increased from 57% in 2009 to 75% in 2013 (possibly as a result of low-skilled workers being priced
    out of the labor market due to the minimum wage requirement), the pace in which firms generate employment has slowed down.

    could reduce this additional time and costs.

Box 2: Scaling up of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) system into a FMIS – the experience of Mongolia

         The PFM reform in Mongolia began in 1993. The main objectives of reform were to
         maintain aggregate fiscal discipline, allocate public resources in accordance with strategic
         priorities, promote the efficient provision of services and strengthen financial transparency
         and accountability. In addition to policy reforms such as the introduction of a Medium
         Term Budget Framework, a key piece of the reforms was to introduce a TSA system and
         improve reporting. The World Bank supported these reforms through three consecutive
         projects totaling around $27.2 million. The Government Financial Management Information
         System (GIFMIS) included (a) establishment of the TSA (b) development of a unified chart
         of accounts (c) adoption of software to the Mongolian environment in budget controls,
         language, and financial management setup (d) training of staff; and (e) assistance in change
         management. The GIFMIS implementation started in 1998 and was implemented over six
         years with a cost of $5.3 million. Subsequent projects (with a total outlay of $21.9 million)
         were designed to expand the core treasury system towards a core FMIS solution by adding a
         budget preparation module, procurement and performance monitoring functions as well as
         Human Resources information system (HRMIS). The GIFMIS improved the budget execution
         and accountability, enabled accurate and timely reporting, strengthened budget oversight
         and monitoring, and improved budget accounting. Vendor payments are made reliably and
         promptly, the proliferation of bank accounts was reduced and aggregate cash balances and
         flows are more accurately reported and controlled.

        All petroleum products in Nepal arrive via truck along the Strategic Road Network. The Ne-
        pal Oil Corporation (NOC) is the sole entity responsible for the import and distribution of
        petroleum products that consumers subsequently purchase from retail vendors at regulated
        (in some cases subsidized) prices. NOC purchases petroleum products from 6 refineries /
        depots across the border with India. In September of 2013 alone NOC distributed roughly
        99 million liters of liquid fuels (about 3,000 tanker trucks worth) and 1.4 million cylinders of
        gas. Total direct transport and insurance costs that Nepal Oil Corporation incurred during
        this single month were approximately NPR 384 million (US$ 3.9 million). This was equivalent
        to approximately 37% of the overall selling losses of 1.04 billion (US$ 10.5 million) that NOC
        incurred on petroleum product sales during the month of September 2013. Nepal’s Cen-
        tral Development Region consumes roughly 70% of NOC’s petroleum imports and is the
        location for the proposed ‘fast track’ road linkage. NOC’s largest fuel storage facilities (one
        at Kathmandu and the other at Amlekhgunj) are roughly at opposite ends of the proposed
        alignment for the ‘Fast Track’ project.

formidable, which means that the economic
viability of traditional high-volume and low-
value crops will remain low. The key challenge
is therefore to move toward lower-volume
but higher-value crops. While households
will understandably continue to address their
own food security through local subsistence
outputs, for income growth their focus needs to
shift more to higher-value products including
fruits, nuts, spices and herbs, as well as certain
vegetables and livestock products (Figure 5).

18. There is significant potential to gain
from exporting to large and booming
international markets where import demand
for higher-value commodities for which
Nepal can develop a comparative advantage
is unmet. The Indian market provides a
formidable and as yet largely untapped source
of demand for high-value products. Nepal
has comparative advantage for high-value
commodities, including cardamom, ginger and
turmeric, some of which will likely emerge as
priorities under the value-chain development
initiatives described above. The increase in total
factor productivity for non-food agricultural
production as shown above suggests that a
strong focus on these commodities would have
a strong positive effect on agriculture growth.

    The projection is for a subset of the SP programs including the old-age cash allowance, single-women’s cash allowance, endangered ethnicities allowance, disability allowance, child
    grant, scholarships and public works programs. Altogether these programs’ budget amounted to around 0.7% of GDP in 2014. The fiscal simulation shows that this amount will shrink
    to 0.3%-0.5% of GDP depending on different assumptions used (including the scenario of indexing the benefit amount to inflation to preserve the purchasing power). See World Bank
