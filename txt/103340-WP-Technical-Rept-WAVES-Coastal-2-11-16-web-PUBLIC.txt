Executive Summary
This guidance note provides review and recommendations for how the protective services of
mangroves and coral reefs can be measured and valued in a manner consistent with national
economic accounts and included in other decision-making processes to support planning for
development, disaster risk, and coastal zone management. It synthesizes evidence of the role
mangroves (Chapter 2) and coral reefs (Chapter 3) play in coastal protection and risk reduction.
It also reviews the tools and approaches commonly used by ecologists, economists and
engineers for estimating the coastal protection services of coastal habitats (Chapter 4).
Moreover, it examines how the valuations of these coastal protection services can be considered
in the System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA), the satellite accounts to the System
of National Accounts (SNA) (Chapter 5). In addition, the note examines where the coastal
protection role of reefs and mangroves has been used in management decisions from local to
national scales (Chapter 6). Finally, it provides recommendations for advancing the assessment
and the use of coastal protection values from coral reefs and mangroves in national and regional
decisions (Chapter 7).

The executive summary provides a synopsis of the coastal protection role of reefs and mangroves
and the recommended approaches for better incorporating these services’ role in coastal
decision-making processes (for example, coastal zoning, development planning, and disaster risk
management) and the SEEA.

In brief, this guidance note finds the following:

•	Mangroves and coral reefs provide significant coastal protection benefits.
•	For both habitats, the key biophysical characteristics that provide coastal protection benefits
  can be clearly identified.

•	These coastal protection benefits have already been influential in informing conservation,
  restoration, and management decisions.

•	The key coastal protection characteristics of mangroves and reefs can be readily incorporated
  in to process-based tools used commonly in engineering and insurance sectors.

•	In terms of ecosystem service valuation, replacement cost methods are the most widely used
  for estimating coastal protection services, although production function methods should
  provide better values for ecosystem accounting.

•	This note recommends and details the use of the Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach
  for estimating and accounting for the coastal protection benefits of mangroves and reefs, with
  such other approaches as replacement cost to be used when certain conditions are met.

Why Focus on Coastal Protection?
Flooding, erosion, inundation, and extreme weather events affect hundreds of millions of
vulnerable people, important infrastructure, tourism, and trade, causing significant human
suffering and losses to national economies. In 2011, insured losses from natural disasters reached
an all-time high and impacts are predicted to worsen with climate change and population
growth. The proportion of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) annually exposed to
tropical cyclones has increased from 3.6 percent in the 1970s to 4.3 percent in the first decade of
the 2000s (UNISDR 2011). Insurers have paid out more than $300 billion just for coastal
damages from storms in the past 10 years, which often goes toward rebuilding similar coastal
infrastructure that is still vulnerable to coastal storms and flooding.

Coastal and marine habitats, particularly coral reefs and mangroves, can substantially reduce
exposure and vulnerability, providing natural protection from risk. Yet the value of these systems
as “green infrastructure” is still not fully recognized, and they continue to be lost and degraded.
The Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction highlights that economic loss risk
resulting from tropical cyclones and floods is growing as exposure of economic assets increases
and the status of ecosystem services degrades (UNISDR 2011), and that societies are excessively
discounting risk in development choices, particularly in coastal areas (UNISDR 2015). In terms of
habitat loss statistics, 30 to 50 percent of wetlands have already been lost (Zedler and Kercher
2005), 19 percent of mangroves were lost from 1980–2005 (Spalding et al. 2010), and 75 percent
of the world’s coral reefs are now rated as threatened (Burke et al. 2011).

The trends in habitat loss and the concomitant loss of coastal protection services will continue
unless the values of these habitats are accounted for in policy and management decisions. The
importance of mainstreaming the coastal protection value of mangroves and reefs is great, as
there are substantial opportunities and risks that will affect the ecosystems and the communities
that rely on their services during the next 5 to 10 years. Sixty percent of the world population is
expected to live in urban areas by 2030, with a greater concentration in coastal areas. As coastal
development increases, there will be heavy investments in coastal infrastructure and the
potential loss of more coastal habitats and their services.

Billions of dollars are being dedicated to reduce risks from disasters and climate change, creating
both threats and opportunities for natural systems. Total Fast Start Finance commitments under
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through 2012 include
roughly $3 billion for climate adaptation assistance. In the United States, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) spends $500 million per year to reduce flooding hazards. Middle-
income countries—such as Brazil, China, and Colombia—are making multibillion dollar
investments to address the risks of flooding and other disasters exacerbated by climate change.
Most of these funds are destined for the creation and maintenance of “grey infrastructure,” such
as seawalls, which will further degrade coastal ecosystems, and may not be cost effective for risk
reduction when compared to more natural and hybrid alternatives.

Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, there has been
substantial scientific focus on recognizing and quantifying the benefits from mangroves and
coral reefs. There has also been an increasing focus on identifying the policies needed to
encourage ecosystem protection and restoration specifically for hazard mitigation and risk
reduction.

The World Bank WAVES Program
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) is a global partnership led by
the World Bank that aims to promote sustainable development by mainstreaming natural capital
in development planning and national economic accounting systems (SNA), based on SEEA.
This global partnership (www.WAVESpartnership.org) brings together a broad coalition of
governments, UN agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and academics for this purpose.

Eight developing countries—Botswana, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia,
Madagascar, the Philippines, and Rwanda—are currently partnering with WAVES to establish
natural capital accounts. More are expected to join during the next two years. These accounts
include experimental accounts for ecosystems and ecosystem services, and mangroves have
been identified as a priority ecosystem for some countries. The methodology for measuring and
valuing the provisioning and tourism services of mangroves and reefs is well established and




                                                10
                                  www.wavespartnership.org



these values are, in principle, included in the national economic accounts. But methodology for
including these regulating services in national economic accounts—notably, coastal protection
services, fisheries enhancement, and carbon storage—is still in an experimental stage and there
is not yet international agreement on their measurement. Guidance is needed for countries that
want to build comprehensive accounts for mangroves and reefs that include all these services.

The WAVES Policy and Technical Experts Committee (PTEC), which was established in the fall of
2012, has a mandate to guide the development and implementation of scientifically credible
methodologies for ecosystem accounting, identify opportunities to contribute to policy and
mainstreaming, and ensure cohesion, consistency, and scalability among the country studies.
This guidance note has been developed under PTEC.

The Coastal Protection Role of Coral Reefs and Mangroves
There is a large and growing body of scientific evidence on coral reef and mangrove coastal
protection services and many on-the-ground projects that demonstrates the value of these
ecosystems for coastal protection. Coral reefs and mangroves can substantially reduce
vulnerability and risk by providing natural protection from flooding and erosion, which is
important to hundreds of millions of people globally. Field measures, models, and demonstration
projects provide strong evidence of the coastal protection benefits of mangroves and reefs.
Coral reefs and mangrove forests should no longer be considered to be a novel way to defend
the coast.

Mangroves
Mangroves provide a variety of ecosystem services to adjacent coastal populations, such as the
provision of food and timber products, and they provide coastal defense services by reducing
risk from coastal hazards. Studies (summarized in Figure 2.1) have found that mangroves
significantly attenuate waves. Studies suggest wave height can be reduced by 13 to 66 percent
over a 100-meter-wide mangrove belt, while wave height can be reduced by 50 to 100 percent
over a 500-meter-wide mangrove belt.

Wave height reduction within a mangrove forest depends on the width of the forest, mangrove
tree morphology, water depth, topography, and wave height. Mangrove species with aerial roots
are more effective at attenuating waves in shallow water, when the waves encounter the roots.
Species without aerial roots are better able to attenuate waves when the water level reaches the
branches. The mangrove vegetation reduces wind speeds over the water surface, lessening the
likelihood of waves increasing in height within mangrove areas. Mangroves affect local
topography over longer-term scales through their effect on sedimentation, erosion, and the
maintenance of tidal creeks and channels. In demonstration projects, this erosion reduction and
sedimentation can lead to the buildup of land and shifts toward less intertidal species in the
coastal community.

Evidence for the ability of mangroves to reduce storm surge flood depths and associated
damage comes from three sources: direct observations of water level heights; the use of
well-validated numerical models that simulate storm surge behavior in the presence or
absence of mangroves; and observations of the damage caused and the number of lives lost
from storm surges in areas with mangrove loss (see Table 2.2). Both empirical data and
numerical models suggest that mangroves can play a role in reducing storm surge peak water
levels when the mangroves are present over sufficiently large areas. Studies measured
reductions in peak water levels of 4 to 48 centimeters per kilometer of mangrove. In low lying

areas, even relatively small reductions in peak water levels could reduce flood extent and,
hence, damage to property.

The relationship between storm surge reduction, bathymetry, topography, distance from shore,
and width of mangrove vegetation is highly complex (like most coastal processes), but it is
increasingly well understood. Topography is the most important local factor affecting inundation
from storm surges, interacting with the peak water level to influence the extent of inundation.
The ability of mangroves to reduce storm surges depends on the storm surge forward speed, the
height of the storm surge, and the cyclone intensity. Numerical models suggest that mangroves
will be more efficient at reducing surge height for fast-moving surges. Extreme events, with very
strong winds or surges many meters high, may damage or destroy mangroves, reducing their
ability to reduce surge height.

Studies suggest that mangroves can also reduce tsunami flood depth, current velocity, tsunami
pressure, hydraulic force, run-up height/distance, and inundation extent. Flood depth is
expected to be reduced by 5 to 30 percent by mangrove belts that are several hundred meters
wide. In addition to mangrove width, other key factors influencing the rate of reduction of
tsunami characteristics include vegetation density, whether the tsunami is a breaking or
nonbreaking wave, and wave period. Tsunamis above approximately 4 meters in height are likely
to destroy mangroves, rendering them ineffective at reducing tsunamis.

Coral Reefs
Coral reefs naturally protect coasts from erosion and flooding by attenuating wave energy and
supplying and trapping sediment found on adjacent beaches. Recent meta-analyses by Ferrario et
al. (2014) show that coral reefs reduce wave energy by up to 97 percent. Reefs function much like
low-crested breakwaters for wave attenuation and their behavior is well characterized in models
and field demonstrations (Sheppard et al. 2005; Gallop et al. 2014). They protect shorelines
primarily by dissipating wave energy, mainly by breaking waves at the seaward edge and through
bottom friction as the waves move across the reefs (Hardy and Young 1996; Wolanski 1994).
Factors determining coral reef wave attenuation include the following: depth of water above the
reef surface; its cross-shore bathymetric profile; and reef rugosity or surface roughness.

Healthy reefs can provide coastal protection, even during cyclones with strong wave conditions
(Blanchon et al. 2010). Coral reefs also generate massive amounts of carbonate as they grow and
are generally expected to be able to keep pace with sea level, if they are healthy. Thus coral reefs
could require little direct maintenance costs for coastal protection, if they remain healthy. However,
declines in the condition of coral reefs in places (for example, Great Barrier Reef, see De’ath et al.
2012; or the Caribbean, see Jackson et al. 2014) coupled with increasing rates of global sea-level
rise are jeopardizing communities and coastal infrastructure, particularly in low-lying small island
developing states. Furthermore, the potential impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise
and coral mortality under warmer and more acid waters (IPCC 2014), may reduce the protection
the coral reefs offer at present (Baldock et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2011).

Reducing threats to coral reefs, such as overfishing and poor water quality, along with
establishing marine reserves, can all directly benefit reefs and maintain their shoreline protection
services. Degraded reefs can be structurally and functionally restored using both biological and
physical techniques, including the use of artificial reefs. Reef restoration has been shown to be
cost effective in comparison to the development of submerged breakwaters (CCRIF 2010;
Fabian et al. 2014; Ferrario et al. 2014). Incorporating nature-based principles into engineered
designs can also yield ecological benefits (Waterman 2008). Merging both ecological and

engineering schools of thought into more mixed integrated designs can yield multiple benefits
and will ultimately be more cost effective than traditional hard infrastructure solutions.

Recommended Approaches for Estimating Coastal Protection Benefits from
Mangroves and Reefs
The methods for estimating the role and value of natural habitats in coastal protection and risk
reduction include index-based and process-resolving approaches. This guidance note reviews
both (i) the common coastal ecosystem service tools and (ii) the engineering tools, models, and
approaches for estimating coastal risks and the role of habitat (and other infrastructure) in
reducing erosion and flooding to avert economic and social damages.

Index-based approaches use estimates of exposure and vulnerability to assess risk and risk
reduction benefits. These indices can be (re)calculated using different configurations of natural
habitats or other environmental conditions (such as sea level) to estimate potential changes in
risk or benefits. For example, the Coastal Vulnerability Module of InVEST (Arkema et al.
2013) uses an index-based approach to assess shorelines most at risk to flooding with and
without coastal habitats. The index scores seven variables (for example, winds, wave surge, sea
level, and habitat type) on a scale of one to five to indicate exposure of the shoreline.

Process-resolving approaches, on the other hand, define meteo-oceanographic variables, such
as waves, storm surges, currents, tides, and sea level, and examine coastal processes, such as
sediment transport and interactions between waves and structures, to assess risks and the value
of habitats in reducing exposure. Process-resolving approaches can be further delineated into
analytical approximations and numerical models. Analytical approximations of coastal
processes or semi-empirical formulations (for example, propagation of waves over vegetation
fields, such as Mendez and Losada 2004) have low computing capacity requirements and are
affordable to implement at large scales. Numerical models resolve coastal processes with higher
accuracy, but can require significant computing capacity and expertise.

More complex and accurate tools require more technical expertise and computing capacity,
which can limit the geographic scale at which process-resolving tools are used. Thus, the
geographic scope of the analysis often defines which approach is used to estimate coastal risks
and protection benefits. Global or national-scale analyses often use index-based approaches
that combine hydrodynamic (for example, mean wave height), geophysical (for example,
geological features), and socioeconomic (for example, population density) data into a unique
metric or index (for example, the United States Geological Survey [USGS] Coastal Vulnerability
Index). Local-, regional-, and global-scale studies are often able to employ process-resolving
approaches that numerically model factors, such as wave propagation, onshore flooding, or
sediment movement. Although process-resolving approaches require more technical expertise,
they can be included in large-scale assessments of coastal protection values, benefits, and
services by using semi-empirical models or analytical equations for ideal conditions.

This guidance note recommends using process-based approaches in general and further
recommends an Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach for valuing the coastal
protection services from reefs and mangroves. The EDF is adapted from approaches
commonly used in engineering and insurance to assess risks and benefits. There are five core
steps to estimating coastal protection benefits from any kind of infrastructure:

1.	 Estimate offshore hydrodynamics
2.	 Estimate nearshore hydrodynamics




                                                13
                             Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



3.	 Estimate effects of coastal structures (habitat) on hydrodynamics
4.	 Estimate flooding or erosion
5.	 Assess expected and averted damages (value coastal protection benefits).

Together, these five steps allow an assessment of coastal habitat protection benefits in terms of
damages averted by conserving or restoring the habitats (Figure ES1). Each of these five steps
represents a different type of problem to be solved, and there is a suite of tools and models for
solving each (see Table 4.1 and Appendix 4.2). The engineering and insurance sectors commonly
use these steps to estimate coastal risks and assess infrastructure alternatives for risk reduction
and climate adaptation (for example, CCRIF 2010; Economics of Climate Adaptation 2009). The
note describes these steps in general terms below. Most of the steps are similar for reefs and
mangroves, with the exception of the third step. These steps describe and advance an EDF
approach to assessing benefits from habitats (for example, Barbier 2007).
1.	 Estimate Offshore Hydrodynamics. The study of coastal protection starts with the
    oceanographic conditions that generate waves from wind in deep waters. Wave generation is
    well understood, and models and numerical databases are available to estimate these terms
    (for example, WaveWatch 3). Coastal applications also require an assessment of winds, waves,
    mean sea level, tides, and storm surge. A key result of this step is an assessment of both
    average and extreme offshore conditions in the region.
2.	 Estimate Nearshore Hydrodynamics. Waves change significantly throughout their
    propagation from deep to shallow waters because of interactions with the bathymetry and
    coastal morphology (although other factors, such as wind transfer, can also affect the waves).
    In their propagation in nearshore environments, waves experience refraction, dissipation,
    diffraction, and other sources of energy transfer. A key result from this step is a
    characterization of nearshore wave heights and energy. These wave heights and energy are
    typically assessed across a range of average and extreme conditions (for example, see
    Economics of Climate Adaptation 2009: USACE 2002).
3.	 Estimate the Effects of Coastal Structures (Habitat) on Hydrodynamics. Nearshore waves
    then interact with habitats (or other structures), which results in wave attenuation and
    wave energy reduction. The models for estimating the effects of offshore structures (such
    as reefs) and intertidal vegetation (such as mangroves) are different. For instance, coral
    reefs attenuate short waves (for example, wind waves) mainly through wave breaking and
    wave energy dissipation, depending on relative depth, rugosity, and reef geometry. In
    contrast, mangrove forests can attenuate both short-wave energy and long waves (for
    example, storm surges).
4.	 Estimate Onshore Flooding or Erosion. After passing over habitats, the remaining wave
    energy is translated into levels of onshore flooding or erosion. The models and equations for
    assessing erosion and flooding are different. At present, most considerations of expected and
    averted damages focus on flooding impacts and rarely assess erosion. For flooding, a key
    result of this step is an assessment of onshore flooding levels relative to storm frequency
    (return periods). As a first-order estimate, a bathtub approach is usually taken where the flood
    height (water level) at the shore is distributed across land based on topographic elevation
    creating a flooding envelope. More complex flooding models take into account different land
    uses (such as different rugosity) and coastal defenses (such as barriers and protections).
5.	 Assess Expected and Averted Damages (Value Coastal Protection Benefits). After flooding
    levels are modeled as a function of event frequency (for example, flood height versus storm
    return period), the next step is to assess the damages or losses from the events. The main




                                                 14

Figure ES1: Conceptual Diagram of the Process-based Steps for the Assessment of Flooding and the Role of
Habitats in Flood Reduction




      analysis is a calculation of the people and assets within (“under”) the flooding envelope (see
      Figure ES1). The expected damages can be adjusted by elevation with a vulnerability curve
      that characterizes past observed relationships between flood height and damage to
      structures. For example, a structure flooded by 0.3 meters of water will have less percent
      damage than a structure flooded by 3 meters of water.
     Spatially explicit data on the distribution of people and assets are necessary to calculate
     potential damages. In the absence of detailed spatially explicit information, the most common
     approach for assessing the distribution of coastal assets for large-scale studies is to spatially
     allocate a country’s GDP or subnational GDP based on population estimates, that to translate
     exposed populations into exposed assets using an estimate of produced capital per capita
     (see World Bank 2010; Hallegatte et al. 2011, 2015). A dataset of global gridded GDP using this
     approach is currently available from UNEP-Grid and the World Bank.1

     A key result of the analyses in this step is the development of an expected damage function
     that describes the likely value of assets flooded under different storm frequencies or return
     periods (for example, once in 10-, 100- and 500-year storms). The final analysis in the
     assessment is the comparison of the differences in expected damages with and without
     coastal habitats. This difference represents the value of the coastal protection benefits.

There are several possible outputs from this five-step approach. The first product is an
assessment of existing risk, which is usually expressed as the Expected Damage Function. The
second product is a comparison of expected damages with and without coastal habitats (see Fig
ES1). The difference in these functions is an estimate of the coastal protection benefits of reef

and mangrove habitats. These comparative results are sometimes referred to as averted
damages. The value of these benefits can be calculated either (i) by comparing the difference in
expected and averted damages at one or more specific storm return periods and/or (ii) by
integrating the area between the curves (Figure 4.2), which represents the average annual
averted damages, that is, annual expected benefit from the habitats (Olsen et al. 2015) This value
is most consistent with other values in the annual accounts.

Existing Valuation Studies and Approaches for Integrating Ecosystem Service
Values into National Accounts
A large suite of tools and approaches for ecosystem service valuation is available. Each method is
suited for specific ecosystem services and requires different types of data and data collection
methods, from personal surveys to property prices and attributes and beyond. A body of
literature exists on the valuation of ecosystem services generated by mangroves and coral reefs,
but it is limited in the number of studies and their geographic coverage. Most valuation studies
come from Southeast Asia. The EDF approach assumes that the value of an ecosystem
(mangrove or coral reef) can be estimated by the reduction in damage expected from storms and
flooding. It provides conceptually valid estimates of economic value and is also aligned with
concepts of value in the System of National Accounts. This approach has been widely used in the
engineering and insurance industry, but has not been as widely implemented in economic
valuation.

In a survey of the literature, the replacement cost was found to be the most commonly used
valuation method for coastal protection services. It is based on the cost of providing built
infrastructure, such as seawalls, to replace the protective services of mangroves and coral reefs,
particularly flood protection and storm surge protection. This method has been used largely
because there is extensive experience in building hard infrastructure to provide coastal
protection, and it is relatively easy to obtain figures for the cost of a seawall of a particular length,
replacing a mangrove forest. However, economic theory cautions that the replacement cost
approach provides a valid measure of economic value only under highly restrictive conditions
that are often not met, or even tested for in the studies that used this approach. These criteria
require that (i) the same service is supplied by the ecosystem and the alternative provider, (ii) the
replacement alternative is the least cost replacement option, and (iii) the replacement alternative
would actually be implemented, if unavailable from the ecosystem.

There have been considerable data challenges to implementing the EDF approach in the past.
The development and greater use of biophysical models to assess the role of mangroves and
coral reefs in preventing flooding and erosion and to estimate expected damage prevention can
provide a more systematic and consistent method to assess benefits from protective services.

Natural Coastal Protection in Policy and Practice
The coastal protection benefits of mangroves and reefs have informed both policy and practice.
There are clear examples over the last several decades where these benefits have led to
significant habitat conservation and restoration actions as well as changes in coastal policies.
This note reviews more than 20 case studies (see Table 6.1) where the coastal protection role of
mangroves and reefs was reflected in five major types of decisions: (i) planning and land use
decisions, including coastal zone management; (ii) coastal defense infrastructure projects;
(iii) national risk and adaptation planning; (iv) habitat restoration; and (v) post disaster recovery.
The guidance note identifies lessons learned and opportunities to advance the use of mangroves
and coral reefs for coastal protection from the review of existing policies and projects.




                                                   16
                                    www.wavespartnership.org



Most importantly, there have been a number of key triggers behind policy change and decisions
supporting natural coastal protection:

i.	 Community-based demand for coastal protection, particularly from mangroves, which is
    often motivated by observed losses of habitat and the ensuing impacts
ii.	 Clear scientific evidence in ecology, economics, and engineering of protection benefits and
     cost effectiveness of nature-based defenses
iii.	 International obligations and funding, particularly for green climate adaptation;
iv.	 Post-disaster rebuilding and restoration that incorporates ecosystems
v.	 Demand for other benefits, such as food security and jobs with natural coastal protection as
    an ancillary benefit.

Recommendations
Based on the review and analysis, this note identifies recommendations for advancing the
assessment and incorporation of coastal protection values from coral reefs and mangroves in
policy decisions (Chapter 7). This executive summary identifies the top 10 of these specific
recommendations.

•	Coral reefs and mangrove forests should no longer be considered a novel way to defend
  the coast. As offshore breakwaters, the basic engineering models of how reefs provide
  coastal protection are well known. Engineering models and field demonstrations of the role of
  mangroves in flood and erosion reduction have been developed over the past several decades
  and clearly demonstrate effectiveness.

•	The most important data gap in more accurately estimating reef coastal protection
  services is nearshore bathymetry, particularly near the reef crest. This is a critical gap for
  understanding coastal processes along many tropical coastlines. Greater emphasis should be
  focused on collecting this data using a variety of approaches, including depth sounding,
  side-scan sonar, and imagery inference (such as SeaWifs). The most important gaps in
  estimating mangrove coastal protection services are forest density and structure, which
  are used to estimate friction values in engineering models and data to validate surge models.

•	The EDF approach is recommended for valuing coastal protection benefits. Caution should be
  applied when using replacement cost valuation to ensure it meets the necessary conditions,
  since the approach tends to overestimate values of coastal protection. But this approach is
  recognized as a second best alternative and often easily implemented approach, if it is not
  possible to do an EDF approach.

•	Pilot projects are needed that incorporate coastal protection services into natural capital
  accounting. These projects should follow the approach in the UN Statistical Division (UNSD
  2013) System of Environmental-Economic Accounting/Experimental Ecosystem Accounting
  (SEEA/EEA). Pilot projects should consider a number of issues, such as developing estimates
  of future service flows and their valuation over time. However, this publication notes that such
  issues as Basic Spatial Units (BSU) and Land Cover/Ecosystem Functional Units (LCEU) may
  be very straightforward to develop for protective services of reefs and mangroves (see
  Chapter 5).

•	Many countries need to develop national coastal risk maps. This is a critical first step for
  overall risk reduction and coastal protection. Many countries are moving toward developing
  these maps, creating opportunities to include natural protection benefits in planning. These
  national risk maps should identify where and how much risk reduction value is currently




                                                  17
                             Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



  provided by reefs and mangroves (that is, identify variation in coastal protection benefits
  nationally). These maps would then also prioritize where coastal habitat protection and
  restoration offer the greatest risk reduction.

•	In many places some of the most cost-effective solutions for coastal protection will be to
  reduce threats and improve management of existing mangroves and coral reefs.

•	Where these ecosystem services have been lost, the restoration of reefs and mangroves
  should be considered as one of the key alternatives evaluated for returning these coastal
  protection benefits. Restoration has been shown to be cost effective for coastal protection in
  comparison to other approaches, such as submerged breakwaters. However, restoration
  should not be used to create novel habitats (that is, putting mangrove or reef-like structures in
  areas where they did not previously exist).

•	Develop guidelines or best practices for restoration of mangroves and reefs for coastal
  protection. There is a growing body of guidance on mangrove restoration, which, while very
  good, can still be enhanced. There is little-to-no guidance on best practices for reef restoration
  for coastal protection.

•	Develop large scale commitments to conserve and to restore degraded mangroves and
  coral reefs. In Vietnam, the amount (hectares) of mangrove conservation and restoration has
  been at the same scale as the past loss of these habitats. Few other countries have made such
  commitments.

•	More developing nations should include reefs and mangroves in their national adaptation
  plans and more developed nations should incorporate coral reef and mangroves in to their
  support programs for adaptation and risk reduction (such as in green adaptation funds).

1| Introduction
Flooding, erosion, inundation, and extreme weather events affect hundreds of millions of vulnerable
people, important infrastructure, tourism, and trade, causing significant human suffering and losses
to national economies. In 2011, insured losses from natural disasters reached an all-time high and
impacts are predicted to worsen with climate change and population growth. The proportion of the
world’s GDP annually exposed to tropical cyclones has increased from 3.6 percent in the 1970s to
4.3 percent in the first decade of the 2000s (UNISDR 2011). Insurers have paid more than $300
billion for coastal damages from storms in the past 10 years, which often goes toward rebuilding
similar coastal infrastructure that is still vulnerable to coastal storms and flooding.

Coastal and marine habitats, particularly coral reefs and mangroves, can substantially reduce
exposure and vulnerability, providing natural protection from risk. Yet the value of these systems
as “green infrastructure” is still not fully recognized, and they continue to be lost and degraded.
The Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction highlights that economic loss risk
because of tropical cyclones and floods is growing as exposure of economic assets increases
and the status of ecosystem services degrades (UNISDR 2011), and that societies are excessively
discounting risk in development choices, particularly in coastal areas (UNISDR 2015). In terms of
habitat loss statistics, 30 to 50 percent of wetlands have already been lost (Zedler and Kercher
2005), 19 percent of mangroves were lost from 1980 to 2005 (Spalding et al. 2010), and 75
percent of the world’s coral reefs are now rated as threatened (Burke et al. 2011).

The trends in habitat loss and the concomitant loss of coastal protection services will continue
unless the values of these habitats are accounted for in policy and decisions. The importance of
mainstreaming the coastal protection value of mangroves and reefs is great, as there are
substantial opportunities and risks that will affect the ecosystems and the communities that rely
on their services over the next 5 to 10 years. Sixty percent of the world population is expected to
live in urban areas by 2030, with a greater concentration in coastal areas. As coastal
development increases, there will be heavy investments in coastal infrastructure and the
potential loss of more coastal habitats and their services.

Billions of dollars are being dedicated to reduce risks from disasters and climate change, creating
both threats and opportunities for natural systems. Total Fast Start Finance commitments under
the UNFCCC (through 2012) include roughly $3 billion for climate adaptation assistance. In the
United States, FEMA spends $500 million per year to reduce flooding hazards. Middle-income
countries, such as Brazil, China, and Colombia, are making multibillion dollar investments to
address risks of flooding and other disasters exacerbated by climate change. Most of these funds
are destined for the creation and maintenance of “grey infrastructure,” such as seawalls, which
will further degrade coastal ecosystems, and may not be cost effective for risk reduction when
compared to more natural and hybrid alternatives.

Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, there has been
substantial scientific focus on recognizing and quantifying the benefits from mangroves and coral
reefs. There has also been an increasing focus on identifying the policies needed to encourage
ecosystem protection and restoration, specifically for hazard mitigation and risk reduction.

1.1| Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES)
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES), which is a global partnership
led by the World Bank, aims to promote sustainable development by mainstreaming natural
capital in development planning and national economic accounting systems (the System of

National Accounts, or SNA), based on the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting
(SEEA). This global partnership (www.WAVESpartnership.org) brings together a broad coalition
of governments, UN agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and academics for this purpose.

Eight developing countries—Botswana, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia,
Madagascar, Philippines, and Rwanda—are currently partnering with WAVES to establish natural
capital accounts. More are expected to join during the next two years. These accounts include
experimental accounts for ecosystems and ecosystem services, and mangroves have been
identified as a priority ecosystem for some countries. The methodology for measuring and
valuing the provisioning and tourism services of mangroves and reefs are well established and
these values are, in principle, included in the national economic accounts. But methodology for
including these regulating services in national economic accounts, notably, coastal protection
services, fisheries enhancement, and carbon storage, is still in an experimental stage and there is
not yet international agreement on their measurement. Guidance is needed for countries that
want to build comprehensive accounts for mangroves and reefs that include all these services.

The WAVES’ Policy and Technical Experts Committee (PTEC), which was established in the fall of
2012, has a mandate to guide the development and implementation of scientifically credible
methodologies for ecosystem accounting, identify opportunities to contribute to policy and
mainstreaming; and ensure cohesion, consistency, and scalability among the country studies.
This guidance note has been developed under PTEC.

1.2| Process for Developing the Guidance Note
This guidance note provides review and recommendations for how the protective services of
mangroves and coral reefs can be included in national wealth accounts and other decision-
making processes to support planning for development, disaster risk, and coastal zone
management. As part of this effort, several extensive reviews synthesize evidence of the role
mangroves (Chapter 2) and coral reefs (Chapter 3) play in coastal protection and risk reduction.
It also reviews the tools and approaches commonly used by ecologists, economists and
engineers for estimating the coastal protection services of coastal habitats (Chapter 4).
Moreover, it examines how how the valuations of these coastal protection services can be
considered in the System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA), the satellite accounts to
the System of National Accounts (SNA) (Chapter 5). Finally, it provides recommendations for
advancing the assessment and the use of coastal protection values from coral reefs and
mangroves in national and regional decisions (Chapter 7). The recommendations identify the
critical needs and opportunities in (i) data, (ii) models and methods, (iii) building support, and
(iv) actions for advancing the assessment and the incorporation of coastal protection values
from coral reefs and mangroves in making decisions. These recommendations are synthetic and
targeted to decision makers.

These chapters and recommendations were reviewed and developed with input from 20-plus
experts who participated in a review and synthesis workshop convened December 3–5, 2014.
Following the workshop, additional experts reviewed the updated chapters. All of the reviewers
are noted in the acknowledgements.

1.3| How to Use the Information
The guidance note aims to provide information, tools, and approaches for valuing the coastal
protection provided by reefs and mangroves. This information is intended to be useful first for testing
in the System of Environmental Economic Accounts-Experimental Ecosystem Services (SEEA-EEA).

The note provides extensive review of the evidence for coastal protection from mangroves and reefs
and discusses how that has already been influential in policy and practice. In addition to helping with
economic accounting, this information is expected to be useful for incorporating natural coastal
protection services in other decision-making processes, including habitat restoration, coastal zoning,
development planning, and disaster risk management. It is anticipated that this note can help further
bridge the gaps between environment and disaster risk management by highlighting where natural
coastal protection approaches can be used by planners, managers and policy makers across these
sectors. This note also identifies key information gaps that should be the focus of future efforts in
research and data collection (for example, nearshore bathymetry).

1.4| Limitations and Cautions
Research on natural coastal protection benefits has advanced tremendously particularly in the
past 10 years following Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami and with the growing
interest in ecosystem-based adaptation and risk reduction. Much of the science and many of the
practices (for example, restoration projects) are relatively new. The authors of this note expect
significant growth and debate to remain concerning natural coastal protection. The
recommended models and tools, particularly those from the engineering and insurance sectors,
are robust and their use for ecosystems requires few, if any, modifications. However, there will be
continued growth in understanding of the particular conditions (for example, storm direction
and intensity and ecosystem rugosity) under which ecosystems succeed and fail to provide
protection. Data gaps, particularly in bathymetry and coastal assets, are critical to address.
These limits affect all assessments of coastal risk and risk reduction strategies, including natural
coastal protection.

2| Coastal Defense Services Provided by Mangroves
Anna McIvor,a,b Tom Spencer,a Iris Möller,a and Mark Spaldinga,b

2.1| Summary
Mangrove forests reduce risk from coastal hazards, such as waves, storm surges, and tsunamis. They
reduce flood depths and wave heights, lessening damage to property behind mangrove forests. The
level of risk reduction depends on the type of hazard, as well as mangrove characteristics. For wind
and swell waves, wave height can be reduced by 50 to 100 percent over 500 meters of mangrove
forest. Mangrove species with dense vegetation are most effective at reducing wave height. With
respect to storm surges, water level measurements and numerical models show that a one kilometer
wide mangrove forest can reduce storm surge peak water levels by 5 to 50 centimeters. This
variation depends on the forward speed of the surge and the presence of channels and pools within
the mangroves, which allow water to flow through more easily. Tsunami water depths can be
reduced by up to 30 percent over approximately 500 meters of mangroves, and this is likely to
depend on the density of mangrove vegetation, as well as tsunami characteristics. However,
mangroves can also be damaged or destroyed by tsunamis and hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons and
their associated storm surges, making them less able to reduce risk from these hazards.

2.2| Introduction
Mangrove forests occur along tropical and subtropical coasts, with an estimated global coverage
of around 152,000 square kilometers. They are found in 123 countries, usually along low-energy
coastlines and in embayments and coastal lagoons. Mangroves provide a variety of ecosystem
services to adjacent coastal populations, such as providing food and timber, as well as coastal
defense services by reducing risk from coastal hazards.

Societies need to understand this coastal defense service of mangroves in order to account for it
and ensure its inclusion in coastal decision making. This is particularly necessary where there are
competing land uses, such as aquaculture and agriculture, which could result in the destruction
of mangroves and increase risk from future coastal hazards. Such land-use changes have been
occurring for many decades and are ongoing in many areas, with mangrove forests being
converted to alternative uses that may seem more profitable in the short term. However, the
long-term costs of these choices may far outweigh the short-term benefits.

This chapter reviews the evidence for the coastal defense services that mangroves provide. It
draws together available data in order to understand both what mangroves can contribute to
coastal risk reduction and what their limitations are in this respect. It focuses on three coastal
hazards: wind and swell waves, storm surges, and tsunamis. It then explores how much these
hazards are reduced by mangroves, and what factors influence the level of reduction. It also briefly
considers whether mangroves can provide a sustainable form of coastal defense into the future.

2.3| Wind and Swell Waves
Although mangrove forests are usually found on shores with little incoming wave energy, they may
receive larger waves during storms, cyclones (also called hurricanes and typhoons), and periods of
high winds. Some common mangrove trees—such as the red mangrove, Rhizophora—have aerial
roots, which help to prop the trees up in the soft sediments where they often grow (shown

  schematically in Figure 2.1). These aerial roots act as obstacles to the passage of wind and swell
  waves, and result in these waves being reduced in height as they pass through the mangrove area.

 Wave attenuation (that is, wave height reduction) through mangroves has been studied in a number
 of locations. Studies suggest that mangroves can reduce the height of wind and swell waves over
 relatively short distances (summarized in Table 2.1). Measured rates of wave-height reduction vary
 between 13 and 66 percent over 100 meters of mangroves, or 50 and 100 percent over 500 meters
 of mangroves, based on data in Mazda et al. (2006) and Quartel et al. (2007) (Table 2.1).

The highest rate of wave height reduction per unit distance occurs near the mangrove edge, as
waves begin their passage through the mangroves. Wave height declines exponentially with
distance through mangroves (Figure 2.2; Bao 2011).

Factors affecting wave height reduction
A number of factors affect the rate of reduction of wave height with distance through a
mangrove forest, such as the density of vegetation, the presence of aerial roots (only present in
some mangrove species), the underlying topography, the height and period of the incoming
waves, and the water depth. The water depth influences the type of vegetation that waves are
passing through (aerial roots, trunks, or branches) (Figure 2.1).

Vegetation structure and water depth: The physical structure of the trees influences the
vegetation density at different heights above the ground. As a result, wave attenuation rates
depend on the water depth (which, in turn, depends on the tidal level), as this affects the height
of the water and, hence, where the waves reach in relation to the structure of the mangrove
vegetation.

For example, Rhizophora species have large prop roots, which form a dense network above the
soil surface (Figure 2.3a). These prop roots are expected to rapidly absorb the energy of waves
passing through them. Above the prop roots, the trunks present less of an obstacle to waves,
allowing them to pass through more easily. This results in high wave attenuation at shallow water
depths (that is, low transmission of waves through mangroves), and then a reduction in wave
attenuation (increase in wave transmission) as the water becomes deeper and the waves are less
affected by the prop roots (Figure 2.3a).

While smaller than the prop roots of Rhizophora species, the pneumatophores of Sonneratia
(Figure 2.3b) and Avicennia also act as obstacles to water movement at shallower depths, causing
high wave attenuation at these depths. Mazda et al. (2006) measured wave attenuation in a
mangrove forest created by planting Sonneratia in northern Vietnam. They found the highest
attenuation at shallow depths, and lower wave attenuation as water levels rose (Fig. 2.3b), until the
water levels reached the height of the branches and leaves, when wave attenuation increased
again as the thickly spread branches and leaves dissipated the wave energy (Mazda et al. 2006).

Mangrove species without aerial roots, such as Kandelia candel, are less able to reduce wave
heights at shallow water depths, but are more effective at higher water depths, when the waves
reach the branches and leaves. This can be seen in Figure 2.3c, which shows waves passing
through Kandelia candel in the Red River Delta, Vietnam (Quartel et al. 2007). Here the rate of
wave reduction increased with water depth, as the waves passed through the denser vegetation
higher up (Figure 2.3c).

Characterizing mangrove vegetation in relation to wave height reduction: The “projected
area” of mangrove vegetation (equivalent to the silhouette of the vegetation, as seen from the
direction of oncoming waves) can be used to calculate the drag coefficient, a measure of the
vegetation’s effectiveness at reducing wave height. Measurements of mangrove trunk height,
width and density, as well as foliage height and width, can be used to estimate the projected area
of vegetation to waves approaching in different water depths. The drag coefficient CD can be
calculated from measured reductions in wave height. A comparison of the drag coefficient with
the projected area of mangrove vegetation for waves passing through Kandelia candel showed
that the drag coefficient could be approximated by the function CD = 0.6 e 0.15A, where A was the
projected cross-sectional area of the underwater obstacles up to a certain water depth
(Figure 2.4; Quartel et al. 2006).

Initial wave height: The rate of wave height reduction depends on the initial wave height; large
waves were attenuated more per unit distance (Figure 2.5).

   (Measurements were taken over a three-hour period, during which water depth remained constant. In the area without
   mangroves, wave reduction was independent of the significant wave height.)




 Other factors affecting wave attenuation: Other factors that will affect the rate of wave
 attenuation within mangroves include the underlying topography, wave period, and tidal flows.
 While mangroves are usually found on very gently sloping shores, tidal channels and erosive
“cliffs” at the edge of mangroves will influence wave propagation through the mangrove areas.
 Cliffed margins can increase wave height behind the margin, as seen in salt marshes; wave height
 is then subsequently reduced as the waves pass through the vegetation (Möller and Spencer
 2002). The mangrove vegetation will also lower wind speeds over the water surface, reducing
 the likelihood of waves increasing in height within mangrove areas.

Reduction of surface winds by mangroves
Mangroves buffer the water surface from the effects of wind, thereby reducing the generation of
wind waves, which can make a substantial contribution to water levels and damage. However,
wind and swell waves mostly originate from the effect of wind on the water surface outside the
mangrove area. By reducing wind speeds over the water surface within the mangrove area, wind
waves do not increase in height in this area (and they are usually reduced due to the presence of
the mangrove obstacles).

Modeling wind and swell waves through mangroves
To understand the level of protection provided by mangroves and to plan how to increase it,
coastal engineers have numerically modeled the passage of waves through mangroves using a
standard wave model within SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore; Suzuki et al. 2011), as well as a
model developed specifically for waves in mangroves called WAPROMAN (for WAve
PROpagation in MANgrove Forest; Vo-Luong and Massel 2008).

These models require knowledge of the mangrove characteristics, the wave parameters, and the
local bathymetry and topography (that is, the slope of the seabed and land). The predictions of
both models matched observed wave data reasonably well. However, the models have only been
tested against data from one location in Vietnam. Further validation is needed to increase
confidence in their ability to predict wave attenuation in other locations, under different
combinations of the controlling factors identified above (for example, with different mangrove
species or topography).

The SWAN model has been used to simulate waves passing through a mangrove island in front of
a port in Orissa, India (Narayan et al. 2010). Such simulations can increase our understanding of
the coastal defense functions currently provided by mangroves and can guide the management
and restoration of mangroves as part of an integrated coastal defense strategy.

Bao (2011) has developed a statistical model to explore the relationship between some standard
forest measurements (tree height, tree density, and canopy closure) and wave attenuation with
distance. The model was able to predict wave reduction within the Vietnamese mangroves for
which it was developed, and could be used to determine the width of mangrove belt needed to
deliver a predefined level of protection from waves. While this approach shows promise for use
by nonexperts at the local level, it currently relies on extrapolating wave attenuation data beyond
measured wave heights and has only been tested in Vietnamese mangroves.

A case study demonstrating how mangroves can be used to reduce waves
The following case study provides an example of how mangroves can be managed to ensure
maximum wave reduction at a port in India.

Narayan et al. (2010) used the SWAN model (as modified by Suzuki et al. 2011) to explore the effect
of a mangrove island (Kanika Sands mangrove island, Orissa, India) on waves reaching Dhamra port,
which lies behind the island (Figure 2.6). Their analysis showed that for cyclone induced wind and
swell waves four meters in height, which are expected to have a return period of 25 years at a
distance of five kilometers from the port (that is, waves of this height are expected to occur, on
average, once every 25 years), wave height at the port would be reduced to less than two meters by
the presence of the mangrove island, assuming the waves were approaching the port at a 90º angle
(Figure 2.6). They also estimated that at the port, 2.5 meters high waves have a return period of 60
years, compared with a return period of 20 years, if the mangrove island were not present (that is,
the mangrove island reduces the likelihood and frequency of large waves reaching the port).

Narayan et al. (2010) also used the model to explore the effects of managing mangroves for
coastal risk reduction (for example, using engineering approaches to extend the island and its
mangrove cover). They concluded that an extension of the island and its mangrove vegetation
on the northern side of the island would further decrease wave height at the port.

This example demonstrates how the current coastal defense services provided by mangroves
can be calculated using appropriate numerical models, and how these models can be used to
determine which forms of mangrove management would be most effective at reducing risk from
large wind and swell waves during storms.

Summary: Wind and Swell Waves
All studies have found that mangroves are able to attenuate wind and swell waves. Over a
100-meter-wide mangrove belt, mangroves can reduce wave height by 13 to 66 percent, while
over a 500-meter-wide mangrove belt, they can reduce wave height by 50 to 100 percent. Most
studies have measured the attenuation of relatively small waves (wave height below 70
centimeters), and further research is needed to measure the attenuation of larger wind and swell
waves (for example, during cyclones, when much larger waves can be present and when
protection from waves is most important).

Wave-height reduction within a mangrove forest depends on the width of the forest, mangrove tree
morphology, water depth, topography, and wave height. Mangrove species with aerial roots are
more effective at attenuating waves in shallow water, when the waves encounter the roots; species
without aerial roots are better able to attenuate waves when the water level reaches the branches.

2.4| Storm Surges
Cyclones cause storm surges when high winds and low atmospheric pressure combine to
increase water levels at the coast, resulting in seawater flooding onto the land. Storm surges can




                                                                       32
                                   www.wavespartnership.org



reach several meters in depth. For example, in 1991 a cyclone with a maximum recorded wind
speed of 225 kilometers per hour created a seven-meter-high storm surge in the southwestern
part of Bangladesh, resulting in the loss of 138,000 lives (Bern et al. 1993; Matsuda 1993).

Cyclones and the storm surges they produce can be a major threat to low-lying coastal areas and
their inhabitants in the areas where they occur (mostly the eastern margins of continents in
tropical and subtropical areas, as such storms tend to travel to the western boundaries of
oceans). They can result in extensive flooding, loss of life, and damage to property. Global climate
change may result in increased storm surge flooding in some areas, through intensification of the
cyclones driving the storm surges and as a result of sea-level rise (Mousavi et al. 2011; Lin et al.
2012).

Under some circumstances, mangroves can reduce damage and loss of life caused by storm
surges by reducing flood depths and reducing the height and energy of wind and swell waves
riding on the surface of the surge (as discussed in the previous section). Evidence for the ability
of mangroves to reduce storm surge flood depths and associated damage comes from three
sources: direct observations of water heights; the use of well-validated numerical models that
simulate storm surge behavior in the presence or absence of mangroves; and observations of the
damage caused and the number of lives lost from storm surges. Table 2.2 lists available studies
(reviewed in McIvor et al. 2012b).

Measured rates of peak water level reduction through mangroves range from four to 48
centimeters reduction per kilometer of mangrove width, based on empirical measurements (4.2
and 15.8 centimeters/kilometer; Krauss et al. 2009), and validated numerical models (up to 48
centimeters/kilometer; Zhang et al. 2012). However, very few data are available because of the
difficulties associated with measuring water levels during storm surges. All data currently
available are from the southeastern United States, where networks of recorders are in place in
wetland areas. Numerical models and simulations, validated using these data, provide a means of
exploring the importance of different factors in reducing storm surge water heights.

While measurements of peak water level reduction rates through coastal wetlands are often
quoted as a certain number of centimeters of water level reduction per meter of inland distance,
such constant attenuation rates imply a linear reduction in water level with distance into the
mangroves (i.e., mangrove width). This is rarely true because the landscape is usually
heterogeneous (i.e., it is usually a mixture of channels, pools and vegetation with a varied
topography), and because the underlying rate of reduction varies with distance travelled
through the mangrove (described below). Consequently, such peak water-level reduction rates
should be regarded with caution. At best, they may serve as rules of thumb with a high degree of
scatter (Resio and Westerink 2008; Wamsley et al. 2010).

Zhang et al. (2012) used simulations based on a validated numerical model to explore the effects
of different widths of mangroves. They found that the largest reduction in peak water levels
occurred at the seaward edge of the mangroves, while further inland the water level changed
more slowly (Figure 2.7). They suggest that this might explain the relatively low rates of peak
water level reductions measured in the field by Krauss et al. (2009; Table 2.2). These
measurements started some distance into the mangroves, and the water level reduction in the
most seaward mangroves might have been higher.

Zhang et al. (2012) note that peak water levels in front of (seaward of) mangroves are increased
by the presence of mangroves, as a bulge of water forms behind the additional resistance to flow
provided by the mangroves.

      Factors affecting storm surge reduction in mangroves
    Storm surge reduction through mangroves is expected to depend on a number of factors:
    (i) mangrove vegetation characteristics, such as forest width, tree density, and structural
    complexity (roots, stems, branches, and foliage) of the dominant species or mix of species;
    (ii) physical characteristics, such as the presence of channels and pools; (iii) the topography of
    the area (both are influenced by mangroves over the longer term); and (iv) storm characteristics,
    such as the size and forward speed of the cyclone, which may interact with mangroves to
    influence storm surge reduction.

        i.	 Mangrove vegetation characteristics: The density of mangrove vegetation is expected to
            affect the ability of mangroves to reduce storm surge water levels (Krauss et al. 2009; Alongi
            2008). However, little field information is available to support this assumption. Mangrove
            vegetation characteristics (Mazda et al. 1997b) affect tidal flows, which are relatively similar to
            storm surge flows, so it is highly likely that the structure, density, and volume of mangrove
            vegetation will also affect storm surge flows and peak water levels.

      ii.	 The presence of channels and pools within mangrove areas: The presence of channels and
           pools within a mangrove area is likely to decrease their capacity to reduce peak water levels,
           because the water is able to pass more easily along these channels and penetrate further
           inland more quickly (Krauss et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2012); the same effect has been reported
           for fragmented salt marshes (Loder et al. 2009). Based on storm surge simulations validated
           with field data, Zhang et al. (2012) found that surge height decreased at a rate of 23
           centimeters/kilometer through an area with a mixture of mangrove islands and open water,
           while in areas with less open water, surge height reduction rates ranged from 40 to 48
           centimeters/kilometer.

      iii.	 Topography: Topography is the most important local factor affecting inundation from
            storm surges, interacting with the peak water level to influence the extent of inundation.
            Mangroves affect local topography over the longer term through their effect on
            sedimentation, erosion, and the maintenance of tidal creeks and channels (Spencer and




                                                                                36
                                    www.wavespartnership.org



   Moller 2013; McIvor et al. 2013). These channels and the levees that form around them
   increase topographic roughness, thereby increasing drag on water flows, and potentially
   reducing storm surge water levels.

iv.	 The size and speed of the cyclone and storm surge: The numerical model of Zhang et al.
     (2012) suggests that mangroves are more effective at reducing the water levels of fast moving
     surges than those of slow moving surges. The water levels within slow-moving surges are likely
     to be relatively unaffected by the presence of mangroves, as the water has time to flow through
     the mangroves. For example, Zhang et al. (2012) found that the south Florida mangroves could
     be expected to protect the area behind them against flooding from a Category 5 hurricane with
     a rapid forward speed of 11.2 meters/second, but not from a Category 5 hurricane with a slow
     forward speed of 2.2 meters/second, based on simulations (Table 2.2). They estimate that a
     mangrove forest with a width of tens of kilometers would be needed to attenuate a two- to
     three-meter storm surge from a slow-moving Category 5 hurricane.

Storm surge reduction by mangroves also depends on initial surge height and surface wind speeds,
because very large surges and very high wind speeds can damage mangroves, rendering them
less effective at reducing water levels. The damage caused to mangroves is described below.

Reduction of surface winds by mangroves
Mangroves may also reduce storm surges through wind reduction. Forest canopies modify wind
speeds as shown in a study of wind speeds around mangrove plantations in Sanjiang Bay in
Haitian Province, South China (Chen et al. 2012). Canopies reduced mean wind speeds up to five
meters/second by more than 85 percent, and when the mean wind speed was greater than 15
meters/second, wind speeds were still reduced by more than 50 percent.

While it is not possible to directly measure the effect of vegetation-reduced wind speeds on
storm surge heights because the effect would never occur independently of other effects, such
as increased drag on the water flow from the vegetation, numerical models can be used to
explore the likely effect of reduced wind speeds on peak water levels. Simulations of Hurricanes
Betsy and Andrew found that peak water levels were more than one meter lower in some areas
when wind speeds were modified to reflect likely reductions caused by vegetation (marshes and
wetland forests in this case, rather than mangroves; Westerink et al. 2008). This implies that the
effects of vegetation on wind speeds could significantly influence storm-surge water levels.

Reduced damage and loss of life behind mangroves
A small number of studies have investigated whether mangroves help to reduce damage and
loss of life during storm surges. Based on a study of three villages in Orissa, India, following the
Odisha cyclone in October 1999, Badola and Hussain (2005) found that in the mangrove-
protected village, damage to houses and other adverse effects were lowest compared to the
other two villages, while crop yields and other positive factors were least impacted. The loss
incurred per household was highest in the village that was protected by an embankment
($153.74), followed by the village with no protection ($44.02), with the lowest losses in the village
protected by mangroves ($33.31). The reason losses were so high in the embankment-
surrounded village was that the embankments were breached. This allowed in sea water, but
subsequently the sea water took time to drain out of the breaches, so that crops were damaged
more than in the village with no protection that suffered the highest level of inundation, but
which drained quickly. Badola and Hussain (2005) note that embankments near the mangrove
forest were not breached while those further away were breached in a number of places,
suggesting that mangroves may have helped to protect those embankments.

Based on a larger-scale study using data from over 400 villages after the same cyclone and in
the same region, Das and Vincent (2009) found that villages with wider coastal mangrove belts
had significantly fewer deaths than villages with narrower mangrove belts or no mangroves (in
1949 mangroves had fronted all the villages). Using a statistical model (Table 2.2), Das and
Vincent predicted that there would have been 1.72 additional deaths per village within 10
kilometers of the coast, if mangroves had not been present. They pointed out that mangroves
saved fewer lives than an early warning issued by the government, which saved 5.84 lives per
village. However, for those people who stayed behind despite the warning, the mangroves
reduced the number of deaths (Vincent and Das 2009; see also Baird et al. 2009, for further
discussion of these results). This study demonstrates how a combination of different risk
reduction measures (in this case, early warning systems and mangrove forests) provided an
increased level of protection in comparison to either measure alone.

It should be noted that the above comparisons between villages assume that the characteristics
of the cyclone-generated waves and water levels were similar at the different locations with and
without mangroves. This is not always the case as wave heights and water levels may vary over
short distances. However, in the study by Das and Vincent (2009), this is unlikely to be an issue
because of the large number of villages included in the analysis, their relative proximity along
the same stretch of coast, and the inclusion of such factors as distance from coast in their
statistical model.

Mangroves can also help people recover after coastal disasters by providing firewood,
building materials, and food sources (for example, fish and shellfish that live among mangrove
aerial roots).

The effect of tropical cyclones and storm surges on mangroves
While mangroves can reduce storm-surge peak water levels, they can also be affected by
cyclones and their accompanying storm surges. Smaller cyclones and storm surges may result
in some tree mortality and defoliation, but in most cases the structural complexity of the
forest is maintained, and the forest is able to recover. During extreme events, tree mortality
can be more extensive, caused by the breaking of trunks, uprooting of trees, the loosening or
shredding of bark, and severe defoliation (Jimenez et al. 1985; McCoy et al. 1996; Lacambra et
al. 2008; Tanaka 2008). The flooding and siltation that may accompany cyclones can cause
further tree mortality (Jimenez et al. 1985; Lacambra et al. 2008). If mass tree mortality
occurs, it may result in the subsequent collapse of sediment and loss of surface elevation, as
dead roots decay, and in some cases this can prevent recolonization for some years (Cahoon
2006).

The force of the water currents within the storm surge, the waves riding on the storm surge, and
the high winds can cause tree damage. Larger trees are more likely to be damaged, and some
species of mangroves may fare better than others. For example, after Hurricane Andrew passed
across Florida in 1992, Rhizophora mangle fared better than Avicennia germinans, and both fared
better than Laguncularia racemosa (McCoy et al. 1996).

While cyclones can alter the structure of mangrove vegetation, in many areas such cyclones are
infrequent and mangrove forests are usually able to recover their structural integrity over a
number of decades, before another cyclone affects the same area (Krauss et al. 2009). The
speed of recovery after events is likely to be determined by the magnitude of the event and local
conditions. This makes it difficult to predict the long-term effects of cyclones and storm surges
on mangroves in any particular location.

The use of mangroves in risk reduction from cyclone impacts
By reducing wave height and storm surge depth, mangroves can reduce flood risk from cyclones
to coastal communities and properties. In practice, where human resources are in close
proximity to mangrove coastlines, mangroves are best seen as part of a wider risk reduction
strategy, which may also include measures such as sea walls, dykes or levees, and early warning
systems, evacuation plans, and refuges. A number of places, such as the Philippines and Vietnam,
have used mangrove restoration extensively for risk reduction (see discussion of these cases in
Section 6). A nonrestoration example of how mangroves can provide coastal defense services
comes from Cairns, Australia, which was affected by Cyclone Larry in 2006. Using an early
warning system and following detailed evacuation plans and procedures, the various commercial,
recreational, and naval vessels that were present in Cairns Port moved deep into the mangrove
creeks to wait out the storm (Williams et al. 2007). All vessels rode out the storm safely with no
loss of life. The combination of an early warning system, evacuation plans, and the presence of
mangrove forests all contributed to this positive outcome.

Summary: Storm Surge
Both empirical data and numerical models suggest that mangroves can play a role in reducing
storm-surge peak water levels, when the mangroves are present over sufficiently large areas.
Studies measured reductions in peak water levels of four to 48 centimeters per kilometer of
mangrove. In low-lying areas, even relatively small reductions in peak water levels could reduce
flood extent and damage to property.

The relationship between storm surge reduction, bathymetry, topography, distance from shore,
and width of mangrove vegetation is highly complex; numerical models based on the underlying
physics of wind forcing and water movement are best able to represent the behavior of storm
surges (Resio and Westerink 2008). Such models are needed to explore the effects of different
factors on storm-surge reduction rates through mangroves. The simulations by Zhang et al.
(2012) demonstrated that peak water levels are expected to decline non-linearly with distance,
with the greatest reduction in peak water level per unit distance occurring at the seaward margin.

The ability of mangroves to reduce storm surges also depends on the storm surge forward speed,
the height of the storm surge, and the cyclone intensity. Numerical models suggest that
mangroves will be more efficient at reducing surge height for fast-moving surges. Extreme
events, with very strong winds or surges many meters high, may damage or destroy mangroves,
limiting their ability to reduce surge height. The threshold at which such damage occurs is likely
to depend on mangrove species and height. Such damage is usually localized to areas that are
relatively close to the storm track.

To date, numerical models have not included spatial variation in mangrove characteristics, such
as mangrove density. It is very likely that sparse, fragmented, or channelized areas will be less
effective at reducing storm surge water levels than dense mangrove vegetation.

2.5| Tsunamis
There is still debate about the role that mangroves play during tsunamis in reducing loss of life
and damage to property. Evidence comes from two types of studies: the use of physical or
numerical models to estimate reductions in tsunami height, flow speed, or other tsunami
characteristics behind coastal vegetation; and direct observations of casualties or damage
behind vegetation following tsunamis, such as the Great Asian Tsunami of 2004. The following
reviews these two types of evidence in turn.

Modeling tsunamis flowing through mangroves
A number of modeling studies have focused on the capacity of mangroves or coastal forests to
reduce the force, velocity, or height of a tsunami. The following draws on a selection of these
studies, which focus on the physical changes in tsunami characteristics when a tsunami enters a
mangrove forest or other type of coastal forest. These studies suggest that mangroves and
coastal forests can play a role in reducing tsunami flood characteristics, as shown in Table 2.3.

These studies are based either on physical models or numerical models, some of which were
validated using data collected after the 2004 tsunami. The studies mostly considered mangrove
belts between 100 and 500 meters wide. They examined a variety of tsunami characteristics,
including flood depth, current velocity, tsunami pressure, hydraulic force, run-up height/distance,
and inundation extent. All of these were seen to be reduced behind vegetation in the studies
shown in Table 2.3. While tsunami force was reduced by 70 percent in one model (Yaganisawa et
al. 2010), the reduction in flood depth was more modest, in the region of 5 to 30 percent (based
on several different models, as shown in Table 2.3).

In front of vegetation (that is, seaward of vegetation), some tsunami characteristics were
increased, such as water level and water pressure. The forests obstruct the flow, causing some
water to back up in front of the vegetation. However, mangroves are only able to reduce these
tsunami characteristics within certain limits, relating to the ability of trees to withstand the force
of the tsunami. Yaganisawa et al. (2009, 2010) studied the fragility of mangroves in the face of
different tsunami wave heights, and found that trees were destroyed by tsunamis greater than 3
to 4 meters in depth (discussed below).

As for all types of waves, the width of the mangrove forest affects the reduction of tsunami
inundation depth, current velocity, and run-up distance (Harada and Imamura 2005, Table 2.3).
Ohira et al. (2012) used the two-dimensional numerical model of Harada and Imamura (2005) to
further explore the effect of forest width. With tsunami depth in front of the forest set to not
exceed four meters (the tree fragility limit), they explored the capacity of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and
200-meter-wide forests, two kilometers in length, to reduce inundation depth, area, flux, and
run-up distance. Their results are shown in Table 2.4. While the 20-meter-wide forest had little
effect, the 200-meter-wide forest was able to reduce inundation depth, area, and run-up
distance by approximately 10 percent. Ohira et al. found that exponential functions could be
used to describe the relationship between forest width and tsunami inundation transmission.

Factors affecting mangrove capacity to reduce tsunamis
Alongi (2008) considers that the following factors are likely to be important in determining the
extent of protection that mangroves can provide from tsunamis: width of forest, slope of forest
floor, tree density, tree diameter, proportion of above-ground biomass vested in roots, tree
height, soil texture, forest location (open coast versus lagoon), type of adjacent lowland
vegetation and cover, presence of foreshore habitats (sea grass meadows, coral reefs, and
dunes), size and speed of tsunami, distance from tectonic event, and angle of tsunami incursion
relative to the coastline. These factors can be broadly divided into (i) tsunami characteristics at
the point of entry into the mangrove forest, and (ii) mangrove characteristics. The following
sections discuss this in more detail.

Tsunami characteristics: Key aspects of a tsunami that affect the capacity of mangroves to
reduce its effects include whether it is a breaking wave versus a nonbreaking wave (which is
likely to be affected by local bathymetry), and the height of the wave as it comes on shore, which
determines whether the mangroves themselves will be destroyed by it.

Mangroves are more able to absorb the energy of breaking waves as opposed to nonbreaking
waves. Husrin et al. (2012) and Strusińska-Correia et al. (2013) found that the highest wave
reduction occurred with breaking waves over the widest forest, based on a physical model of a
tsunami entering a forest. The model forest performed poorly against nonbreaking tsunami
waves. Apotsos et al. (2011) also found that increased surface roughness (such as that caused by
forest cover) reduced the maximum run-up elevation and maximum wave velocity for breaking
and near-breaking waves, while less effect was seen for nonbreaking waves.

Tsunami wave period is also important. Even with a wide forest belt, tsunamis with longer period
waves resulted in greater inundation depths and greater hydraulic forces, based on the model of
Harada and Imamura (2005). Variation in the response of tsunami characteristics to mangroves
may also occur between the different waves that make up a tsunami wave train (Gelfenbaum
et al. 2007).

Vegetation characteristics: Forest density is expected to affect tsunami flows. Simulations
using the Delft3D-FLOW model (validated using field data from the 2004 tsunami in Aceh;
Table 2.3) found that increased mangrove densities decreased the maximum water level, run-up
height, and maximum flow speed (Gelfenbaum et al. 2007, Table 2.3). However, Harada and
Imamura (2005) found that forest density had less influence on inundation depths, currents, and
hydraulic force than forest width (based on a two-dimensional numerical model of a three meter
tsunami passing through a 50-meter-wide forest with either 10, 30, or 50 trees per 100 m2).

Other vegetation measures that influence tsunami characteristics include the submerged tree
volume (that is, the volume of vegetation that is under water) and the tree’s frontal area (this is
the same as the projected area, described above). Husrin et al. (2012) found that these measures
influenced the hydraulic resistance to tsunami flow provided by trees, based on their physical
model of tsunami flows.

The combination of tsunami and mangrove characteristics, which affects tree breaking:
Tsunami height (related to hydraulic force) is important, because large tsunamis can damage or
break trees. As long as trees are able to withstand the tsunami force, they not only reduce

tsunami flow, but can also trap debris, which would otherwise increase the destructive force of
the tsunami. However, once they are broken, the trees contribute to this floating debris.

Yaganisawa et al. (2009) modeled the effect of tree breakage and included a mangrove fragility
function based on stem diameter and tsunami height. They found that mangrove forests could
reduce tsunami inundation depth by 30 percent for a three-meter inundation depth and
30-minute wave period. When the tsunami inundation depth exceeded three meters, the
reduction effect was reduced due to the tsunami destroying the mangrove forest. A 4.5-meter
tsunami inundation depth destroyed 50 percent of the mangrove forest, and most of the forest
when the depth reached 6 meters. In a separate study, Yaganisawa et al. (2010) again found that
for tsunami inundation depths greater than four meters, the forest would mostly be destroyed
and therefore would not reduce the hydrodynamic force of the tsunami.

Tanaka et al. (2007) found that when the main trunks of coastal trees (several species) had a
diameter greater than 10 centimeters, they were seldom broken by tsunamis. However, there
were exceptions to this: the trunks of Rhizophora apiculata were broken on Kang Island, Thailand,
under the force of an eight-meter tsunami wave, and the trunks of Rhizophora mucronata were
broken on Medilla, Sri Lanka with a six-meter tsunami (based on observations of tsunami
damage to trees following the 2004 tsunami). Tanaka et al. (2007) note that the aerial roots of
Rhizophora spp. trees allowed the moment of the drag force to be shared between them, so that
they were able to withstand a five-meter tsunami. When the drag moment exceeds the threshold
for the breaking moment, the trunks of these species were broken just above the aerial roots.

Tsunamis can uproot trees. Tanaka et al. (2007) noted that uprooting usually occurred at the
front of the vegetation, where roots were undercut by erosion. Most of the broken and uprooted
trees were not washed away but remained where they had been growing. Inside coastal forests,
erosion seldom occurred except for local scour around tree trunks, and this was not sufficient by
itself to uproot trees.

Loss and damage studies
Following the Great Asian Tsunami in 2004, several studies and reviews explored whether
mangroves reduced loss and damage in areas behind them (for example, Kathiresan and
Rajendran 2005; Danielsen et al. 2005; Dahdouh-Guebas et al. 2005; Dahdouh-Guebas and
Koedam 2006; Danielsen et al. 2006; Olwig et al. 2007; Forbes and Broadhead 2007; Iverson
and Prasad 2007; Alongi 2008; Baird and Kerr 2008; Iverson and Prasad 2008; Mukherjee et al.
2008; Cochard et al. 2008; Lacambra et al. 2008; Kerr et al. 2009; Rasmussen et al. 2009;
Tanaka 2009; Cochard 2011). Many of the studies were disputed, and there was considerable
debate about the validity of the data or approaches used. However, it is beyond the scope of this
report to examine these studies or their critiques further.

Laso-Bayas et al. (2011) led a study for which there has so far been little debate. They used a
spatial statistical analysis (a spatial generalized linear mixed model) to estimate the effect of
coastal vegetation on tsunami damage and casualties in an area of Aceh, using field data and
remote-sensing (satellite) data. The vegetation in the study area did not include mangroves, but
did include coastal vegetation, in the form of plantations of coconut and rubber trees. Laso-
Bayas et al. (2011) found that distance from the coast was the dominant determinant of tsunami
impacts, measured as number of casualties and structural damage. Additionally, they found that
the presence of vegetation in front of settlements (represented in their model as an increase in
land cover roughness) reduced the number of casualties by an average of five percent. However,
dense vegetation behind settlements increased the amount of structural damage that occurred.

Summary: Tsunamis
Several physical and numerical modeling studies suggest that mangroves can reduce tsunami
flood depth, current velocity, tsunami pressure, hydraulic force, run-up height/distance, and
inundation extent. Flood depth is expected to be reduced by 5 to 30 percent by mangrove belts
that are several hundred meters wide. As well as mangrove width, other key factors influencing
the rate of reduction of tsunami characteristics include vegetation density, whether the tsunami
is a breaking or nonbreaking wave, and wave period.

Tsunamis above approximately four meters in height are likely to destroy mangroves, rendering them
ineffective at reducing tsunamis. Once trees have been broken by the flow of water, they will
contribute to the debris carried by the tsunami flow, potentially causing more damage further inland.

Tsunami water levels may be increased in front of (that is, seaward of) vegetated areas,
potentially resulting in further loss and damage in these areas.

2.6| Mangroves as a Form of Sustainable Coastal Defense
The continued provision of mangrove coastal defense services depends on their capacity to
adapt to future changes, in particular to projected rates of sea-level rise. In some areas,
mangroves may be able to keep pace with rising sea levels through an increase in the height of
their soil surface elevation (Figure 2.8).

Historically, some mangrove areas have kept pace with sea level rise over thousands of years; an
example of this can be seen at Twin Cays, Belize (McKee et al. 2007; Figure 2.9). Studies of soil
cores suggest that soils built up at rates of one millimeter/year to 10 millimeters/year in different
locations and settings (reviewed in Ellison, 2009). However, in other areas, mangroves were not
able to keep up with rates of sea level rise, and were drowned by rising sea levels. This shows that
while mangroves can sometimes keep pace with sea-level rise, this depends on various other
factors and the local rate of sea-level rise.

Recent evidence of soil elevation change (based on measurements using the Surface-Elevation
Table – Marker Horizon methodology, from studies published between 2006 and 2011) suggest
that mangrove surfaces are rising at similar rates to sea level in a number of locations (Table 2.5;
reviewed in McIvor et al. 2013). However, these measurements are from a relatively small number
of sites, and most records span short time periods.

 Several processes are known to influence surface elevation change in mangroves, including
 sedimentation, accretion, erosion, growth of subsurface roots, and the compaction of soils
 over time. Factors that affect these processes and, therefore, the rate of surface elevation
 change, include the supply of external sediment, vegetation characteristics, such as tree
 density and aerial root structure, nutrient availability to subsurface roots, storm impacts, and
 several hydrological factors, such as river levels, rainfall, and groundwater pressure.

Threshold rates of sea-level rise are likely to exist, beyond which mangrove surface elevation
changes are no longer able to keep up. These thresholds are likely to vary in different locations
(for example, depending on local rates of sediment supply). Because of the large number of




                                                                                 46

processes and factors involved, prediction of future surface-elevation change is very challenging.
McIvor et al. (2013) review these topics in more depth.

In conclusion, it is likely that many mangrove areas may be able to keep pace with moderate
rates of sea level rise, provided the areas are managed wisely (for example, by maintaining
sediment inputs, protecting mangroves from degradation). However, it would also be prudent to
ensure that space is left behind current mangrove areas to allow them to colonize these areas as
sea level rises. Actions that contribute to mangrove survival with sea-level rise will help to
maintain the coastal defense functions of mangroves into the future. Currently, short-term
anthropogenic losses of mangroves represent a greater threat to their provision of coastal
defense services than the long-term effects of sea-level rise.

2.7| Conclusions
Mangroves can contribute to the reduction of coastal hazards, including wind and swell waves,
storm surges, and tsunamis. As such, they are able to reduce loss and damage from these
hazards, with associated reductions in economic losses. Therefore, the appropriate management
and conservation of mangroves has value, and accounting for this value is needed in order to
enable the best decisions to be made along stretches of coast that are both subject to these
hazards and have mangrove vegetation.

It is important to note that hazards are usually only partially reduced by mangroves. However,
even small changes in water levels can result in reduced flood extents and, therefore, reduced
damage to property and loss of life. It is rarely appropriate for mangroves to provide the only
form of coastal defense. Mangroves can contribute to coastal risk reduction strategies alongside
other risk reduction measures, such as structural defenses, early warning systems, or planning
approaches that ensure that dwellings are not placed in high-risk zones.

The capacity of mangroves to reduce hazards may be limited by characteristics of the hazard,
such as tsunami height or wind speeds during cyclones, which can also destroy mangroves. This
also needs to be taken into account when planning coastal risk-reduction strategies, and is a
further reason for ensuring a diverse approach to risk reduction.

While a number of factors are likely to affect the ability of mangrove to reduce these coastal
hazards, the most important factor is mangrove forest width. Generally, a mangrove belt several
hundred meters wide is desirable. Dense forests are expected to be most effective at reducing
hazards, and mangrove species with aerial roots are better able to reduce wind and swell waves
and also to withstand inundation by tsunamis. However, in terms of coastal planning, risk
reduction strategies need to be designed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the local
hazard context, local geomorphology and bathymetry, local mangrove characteristics, and the
population needing protection.

3| Coastal Defense Services Provided by Coral Reefs
Philip A. Kramer
The Nature Conservancy


3.1| Summary
Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and economically valuable ecosystems. Of
particular value is the role coral reefs provide in protecting coastal communities from natural
hazards, such as flooding, coastal storms, and sea-level rise. Coral reefs naturally protect coasts
from erosion and flooding by absorbing wave energy, as well as supplying and trapping
sediment found on adjacent beaches. Coral reefs reduce wave energy by up to 97 percent
(Ferrario et al. 2014). Reefs function similar to low-crested breakwaters whose hydrodynamic
behavior is well characterized by coastal engineering models and field demonstrations
(Sheppard et al. 2005; Gallop et al. 2014). Critical to their ability to function as breakwaters is the
ability of coral reefs to generate massive amounts of carbonate structure, which allows them to
keep pace with sea level. Unlike artificial breakwaters that require significant maintenance costs,
coral reefs are self-sustaining as long as they remain healthy. Healthy reefs can provide a
significant part of coastal protection even during cyclones under strong wave conditions
(Blanchon et al. 2010). However, declines in the condition of coral reefs in places (for example,
Great Barrier Reef, see De’ath et al. 2012; or the Caribbean, see Jackson et al. 2014) coupled with
increasing rates of global sea-level rise are jeopardizing communities and coastal infrastructure,
particularly in low-lying small island developing states. Further, the potential impacts of climate
change, including sea-level rise and coral mortality under warmer and more acidic waters (IPCC
2014), may reduce the protection they offer (Baldock et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2011).

Reducing threats to coral reefs, such as overfishing and poor water quality, and establishing
marine reserves, can all directly benefit reefs and maintain their shoreline protection services.
Degraded reefs can be structurally and functionally restored using biological, physical, and
artificial techniques. Reef restoration has been shown to be cost effective in comparison to the
development of traditional submerged breakwaters (Fabian et al. 2014; Ferrario et al. 2014;
CCRIF 2010). Incorporating nature-based principles (for example, the biomorphology and
geohydrology of the existing reef, existing and potential natural values, and drawing on materials
and forces already present on the reef) into the design of engineered breakwater structures can
yield a greater array of benefits (Waterman 2008). Restoration projects also benefit if local
communities and cultural values are incorporated into design principles. Merging both ecological
and engineering schools of thought into more mixed integrated designs may also be more cost
effective than traditional hard infrastructure solutions. Methods for valuing the coastal protection
services of natural reefs compared to engineered structures continues to evolve and will improve
decision making and management approaches in the coastal zone.

3.2| Coral Reefs: Basic Ecology and Biogeography
Coral reefs are underwater structures built by corals and other organisms, such as coralline
red algae that secrete calcium carbonate. They contain about 25 percent of the oceans
biodiversity and are vitally important as a source of food, shelter, medicine, and cultural and
aesthetic value to coastal communities. The characteristic of coral reefs is to grow vertically
through the deposition of aragonite and other biogenic minerals, a feature that distinguishes
them from ahermatypic reefs (nonreef building). Coral reefs occur to depths of about 50
meters with the majority of coral growth often found at 10 to 20 m. Although there are




                                                  54
                                    www.wavespartnership.org



hermatypic deep water coral reefs (greater than 50 meters) found in all the ocean basins,
even into the polar regions, little is known about them and they do not play a significant
shoreline protection service due to their great depths. Shallow water hermatypic coral reefs
cover approximately 285, 000 square kilometers or 0.1 percent of the world’s oceans. They
occur most abundantly in clear shallow tropical waters on the windward sides of continents
and islands. The Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia each contain about one quarter of the
world’s coral reefs, followed by Australia (17 percent), the Indian Ocean (13 percent), the
Atlantic (10 percent), and Middle East (6 percent). This review focuses on shallow coral reef
barriers (water depths less than 5 meters) that play the largest role in wave attenuation and
coastal defense.

The process of carbonate production is an important aspect of the role reefs play in coastal
defense and distinguishes them from other habitats, such as mangroves, which principally
trap, rather than generate, sediment (Woodroffe 1992; Milliman 199.3). The balance between
carbonate production and erosion over time controls the rate that reefs can grow vertically or
accrete. Rates of carbonate production for coral reefs are some of the highest in the world
and have been measured from 1000 to 4000 grams calcium carbonate per square meter per
year (Mellela and Perry 2007 and reference within). Erosion works against carbonate
production, causing a loss of the three-dimensional structural relief and a flattening of the reef
surface over time. Erosion is mainly a function of bioerosion by fishes, echinoderms, and other
bioeroding organisms, but reefs are also affected by physical and chemical erosion (Perry et
al. 2013). Geological investigations of recent Holocene reefs have shown that reef accretion
can be as high as 14 millimeters per year in the Pacific, but more commonly averages 3.5
millimeters per year (Buddemier and Smith 1988). In a recent review of Caribbean reefs, Perry
et al. (2013) found that today many shallow (less than 5 meters water depths) reefs in the
Caribbean are accreting at much lower rates (about 0.68 millimeter per year) mainly because
of recent losses in large reef-building acroporid corals. Under current rates of erosion,
Caribbean reefs are thought to need at least 10 percent live coral cover to maintain their reef
surface (Perry et al. 2013).

Shallow coral reefs can have distinctly different compositions, shapes, and zonation, all of which
influence their wave-breaking characteristics and coastal protection properties. Three main
types have long been distinguished (fringing, barrier, and atoll), but over a dozen geomorphic
types have been described and mapped (Andrefouet et al. 2006). Most reefs contain
predictable zones of coral development from offshore to inshore, including fore reef, reef crest,
reef flat, and back reef zones. The location and morphology of these zones are the result of
antecedent topography, as well as the interplay between coral growth and wave energy
(Figure 3.1). The width of back reef lagoons can vary considerably from greater than 10
kilometers in the case of barrier reefs to being nonexistent in near shore fringing reefs. Water
depths of back reef lagoons can exceed 30 meters in barrier reefs or where there is high
sediment runoff from adjacent land masses.

3.3| Role of Coral Reefs in Coastal Protection
Coral reefs protect shorelines by absorbing and dispersing a significant part of the wave energy that
otherwise would be transmitted onshore. This mainly occurs by breaking waves at the seaward
edge of the reef and through bottom friction as the waves cross the reefs (Gourlay 1994, 1996a, b;
Hardy and Young 1996; Wolanski 1994). After waves break and attenuate, the mean water level
raises onshore (set-up) and currents and reef circulation are set in motion, mobilizing the transport
of sediments, nutrients, and larvae (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart 1962; Symonds et al. 1995; Lowe
et al. 2005). A substantial amount of wave energy dissipated from a wave as it passes across a reef.

Reef crests were found to dissipate 86 percent of the total incident wave energy, while reef flats
dissipated 65 percent of the remaining wave energy (Ferrario et al. 2014). The whole reef (reef crest
and reef flat) accounted for 97 percent of the total wave energy reduction (Figure 3.2). Appendix 3.1
provides an overview of the contributions of coral reefs to coast defense from 27 independent
studies, including the Caribbean, Maldives, Australia, China, Japan, Guam, and Hawaii. Several

factors influence how effective coral reefs are in reducing wave energy and protecting coastlines,
including water depth, reef morphology and slope, and reef surface roughness.

The depth of water above the reef surface is a critical factor in determining wave attenuation
(Koch et al. 2009) and can vary by reef type, often depending on the degree of wave exposure
and slope of the underlying platform (Gourlay 1996). Water depths are usually shallowest on the
outermost reef crest or algal ridge (~ +/– 0.5 meters relative to MSL) where the majority of waves
break over a distinct reef lip or edge. At low water, the greatest amount of the incident wave
energy is dissipated by the reef crest and only short-period waves tend to make it across a reef
flat. At higher water levels, longer period waves (for example, wind waves) can pass across the
reef crest onto the reef flat and back-reef areas (Brander et al. 2004; Lugo-Fernandez et al.
1998). Along with daily tides, water levels around reefs can have inter- and intra-annual variations,
mainly associated with changes in atmospheric pressure and water temperature. In the spring,
extreme low tides can occur, exposing reef crests for extended periods (Anthony and Kerswell
2013), whereas extreme high tides occur during the fall when cyclone activity is highest. During
high-water cyclone events, such as Hurricane Wilma in the Yucatan, shallow reef crests
continued to dissipate most of the wave energy (Blanchon et al. 2010). In other reef settings,
such as the Great Barrier Reef, cyclone-generated 10-meter waves were reduced to 6 meters in
the lee of the coral reef matrix with further dissipation because of bottom friction (Young and
Harday 1993). Very long period waves (for example, swell up to 30 meters generated from
distant cyclones, tsunamis, and large tidal bores) can also raise water levels along the entire shelf,
thereby allowing water to overtop reefs and be transmitted inshore. The extent of reef
overtopping associated with these unusual and time-limited events (hours to a few days) will
depend on their arrival time relative to daily tides (See Hoeke et al. 2013).

The morphology of the reef surfaces across the entire cross-shelf bathymetric profile also affects
wave dispersion. This can include the shape and slope of the outer fore reef, dimensions of the
outermost reef crest and reef flat (length, width), as well as the presence of back-reef coral and
sand build-ups (for example, patch reefs and lagoonal sediment banks). The transmission of the
wave energy from the offshore wave regime to the shoreline can vary greatly across reef
geometries and properties (Rosman and Hench 2011; Baldock et al. 2014). Blanchon et al.

(2007) hypothesized that the morphology of shallow reefs is largely controlled by wave exposure
and the underlying platform shelf width and slope (Figure 3.3). Steeper fore reef slopes
(~>1:5) result in greater wave set-up (Gourlay 1996), but other factors, such as the frequency and
depth of channels through the reef crest, can also influence wave breakage (Callaghan et al.
2006). The width of the reef crest and associated reef flat can range from a few meters to over
several thousand meters. Wider reef flats dissipate proportionally more wave energy up to a
width of about 150 meters after which wave energy reduction remains fairly constant (Ferrario et
al. 2014). Thus, even comparatively narrow reef flats dissipate much of the remaining wave energy.
The total length and number of breaks (continuity) of reef surfaces also has an important effect on
wave breaking and back-reef circulation dynamics. Breaks in the reef crest are fairly common and

function as outlets for backreef waters that accumulate by across-the-reef wave-induced
currents, wave set-up, and tides. Incident wave energy entering into the backreef decreases with
the continuity of the reef crest. Indeed, the circulation across some atolls with continuous reef
crests and only shallow channel breaks can be entirely driven by waves overtopping the
windward side (such as wave pumping) (Callaghan et al. 2006). Discontinuous and
semicontinuous reef crests in the Caribbean were found to reduce significantly less (about 27
percent) wave energy than continuous reef crests (Roberts 1980). However, some discontinuous
reefs can cast a wave shadow much larger than the reef itself and in one case a matrix of isolated
reefs was found to be remarkably effective at attenuating wave energy (Gallop et al. 2014).

The reef rugosity, or surface roughness, is a third factor affecting wave attenuation. Surface
roughness creates frictional and form drag (collectively referred to here as drag) as waves and
currents passing over the reef. Rugosity is related to substrate type (Nelson 1996). Sand and
pavement offer little friction; whereas large coral formations (greater than 30 centimeters) growing
on the reef surface create the greatest friction and are the most important for wave attenuation.
Drag over a reef flat may be about 10-times greater than drag over a sandy bottom, so coral
structure at both the reef crest and across the reef flat plays an important role in attenuating wave
energy (Lugo-Fernandez et al. 1998). The effect of drag on wave energy dissipation has been
estimated to be substantial and increases as water levels over the reef crest decrease (Huang et al.
2012). When reef structural complexity is reduced due to storms or erosion, the ability to buffer
wave energy is also decreased. The loss of reef rugosity can occur instantly in the case of direct
physical damage (for example, storms or ship grounding) or more gradually following a mass coral
mortality event (for example, mass bleaching followed by high coral mortality and unsuccessful
coral recruitment). In low-lying areas, the loss of this function greatly increases the vulnerability of
coastal areas to flooding (Figure 3.4). Sheppard et al. (2005) used Gourlay’s model (1997) to
determine changes in wave energy reaching the shoreline on 14 Seychelles fringing reefs from
before the 1998 bleaching event to 2004, and projected for the next decade out. In their 2004
surveys, they found negligible recovery with greater than 99 percent of reef flat corals dead and a
general rounding off of reef crest structure. Model results indicated greater wave energy and
flooding of island beaches were correlated to the erosion potential (amount of three-dimensional
structure that would be reduced by erosion). Assuming no coral recover, they predicted a doubling
in the loss of coastal protection services over the decade following 2004.

In summary, a reef’s cross-shore bathymetric profile, the height and width of the barrier (for
example, reef crest), and surface rugosity are all important variables that influence the degree of
wave attenuation. These parameters are well known from coastal engineering to be critical in
estimating effects of structures on erosion and flood reduction. Indeed, there are many
similarities between coral reefs and low-crested submerged breakwaters, which have been
studied, modeled, and deployed extensively by coastal engineers (for example, Burcharth et al.
2007; Ranashinge and Turner 2006; Pilarczyk 2003). Much of this body of knowledge and
experience can be applied to the design of reefs for coral reef and coastal restoration, including
existing engineering tools and models.

3.4| Threats to Coral Reefs and Implications for Coastal Protection
Coastal defense functions of reefs will continue if reef accretion keeps pace with rising waters.
For reef-building coral populations to persist, the rate of coral growth and recruitment must
equal or exceed rates of mortality of adult corals. There is growing concern that coral mortality is
increasing while coral recruitment, particularly for reef-building corals, is decreasing (Bruno and
Selig 2007; Perry et al. 2013). Coral reefs are degraded worldwide (for example, Burke et al. 2011;
Souter 2008; De´ath et al. 2012) because of overfishing, bleaching, biotic threats (such as crown-

of-thorns starfish outbreaks and disease), sedimentation and pollution, and destructive practices
(such as coral mining and blast fishing). In the Caribbean, there has been a widespread loss of
fast-growing, reef-building corals during the past 30 years (Jackson et al. 2014). Caribbean reefs
today are increasingly dominated by small “weedy” corals that do not produce the carbonate
volume necessary to maintain reef surfaces, much less keep up with rising sea levels (Perry et al.
2013). Less is known about the dynamics of crustose coralline algae, which play an important role
in constructing shallow reef crests, because of the lack of research directed to these exposed
higher energy reef crests.

The timescales for how changes in coral reef condition will influence whole-reef accretion
dynamics and shoreline protection is not well understood because of high spatial and temporal
variability in the erosion and deposition processes. There is some evidence to suggest that even
in the face of accelerated sea-level rise, many coral reefs may remain viable protectors of
shorelines for decades to come. For example, Webb and Kench (2010) studied the change in
the sizes of 27 Pacific atolls and found that 86 percent remained stable or increased in size, even
though sea level has increased at rates of about 2 millimeters per year. They suggested that
erosion of reef islands is just one possible outcome, but concluded that reef islands are more
geomorphologically enduring features than is often appreciated. Woodroffe (2008) also
suggested that seaward shorelines of many atolls would continue to accrete, even with
accelerated sea level rise, provided there is sufficient sediment supply from the growth and
breakdown of the adjacent coral reefs. Indeed, even if reef growth declines and rates of erosion
increase, some wave protection service will continue due to the inert limestone matrix
underlying living reefs. However, wave protection services will eventually diminish over time, if
reef health declines.

Net accretion of a reef ceases when rates of erosion exceed rates of growth and recruitment. The
most immediate result is a flattening of the reef surface that reduces the height of the three-
dimensional coral surface and the overall rugosity. As the reef surface flattens, water depths over
the reef increase (Alvarez-Filip et al. 2009). The loss in rugosity decreases the drag on waves
(see previous section). More wave energy begins to pass through the reef, resulting in increased
wave orbital sizes in the back reef and potential secondary affects to inshore sea grass habitats
(Saunders et al. 2014). Rates of erosion may also decrease as the loss of structural habitat,
coupled with higher wave energy, makes reef crest habitats less attractive to parrotfish and other
bioeroders. Reef areas that will be more susceptible to flattening include poorly managed reefs
and those with fewer species of reef building coral (for example, biogeographic regions further
away from such biodiversity hotspots as the Coral Triangle) or those near the environmental
limits of coral growth (for example, cooler water temperature and lower visibility).

The extent that reef health and wave protection services will be lost over time will depend in large
part on how well human-caused threats are reduced and managed. Effective management of
reefs is currently poor in many areas, although management improvement efforts are underway.
Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be an effective way to reduce threats to coral reefs and have
been shown to enhance their recovery following disturbances (Mumby and Harbourne 2010).
Marine reserves are now estimated to encompass nearly 10 percent of the world’s reefs (Burke et
al. 2011), although this amount is considered insufficient to ensure the protection of global coral
reef diversity (Mora et al. 2006). An additional concern is the level of adequate management.
Implementation varies considerably among MPAs and many MPAs remain “paper parks.”
Despite this, there is a trend of increased management effectiveness and improved financing to
support enforcement and regulate human activities that are detrimental to reefs. Coastal
communities are also being engaged in the management process through the use of locally

managed access areas and Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFS). However, destructive
overfishing on coral reefs remains a significant problem, particularly where populations are high
and reefs are a primary food source. Treating sewage and controlling runoff is also challenging in
small-island developing states where local economies and decentralized development make
advanced waste-water treatment challenging. Reducing impacts and threats to reefs that
protect shorelines—before they become degraded—is a much more cost-effective approach to
maintaining their defense services.

3.5| Coral Reef Restoration
As human impacts to coral reefs have become more widespread and prevalent, so too have
proactive actions to repair or replace disturbed or damaged reefs to return them to their previous
state or, in other cases, to enhance them. Coral restoration has recently become a growing field of
active research and experimentation that is beginning to offer a significantly wider array of
actions for managers and policy makers to consider. These include both passive threat-reduction
measures, such as eliminating the use of habitat-damaging fishing gear, as well as active or direct
interventions, such as coral transplantation (Edwards and Gomez 2007). However, it should be
emphasized that most active coral restoration actions are currently restricted to small spatial
scales (for example, less than one square kilometers) and are currently unlikely to achieve
ecological outcomes at the scales that reefs function and widespread reef degradation typically
occurs (for example, greater than one square kilometer). Therefore, coupling active restoration
with improved reef management strategies (for example, water quality, overfishing, and habitat
protection) will be essential for meaningful long-term restoration success of degraded reefs. Most
restoration projects (about 90 percent) focus on biological coral recovery with less than 20
percent designed with coastal protection benefits in mind (Fabian et al. 2014). Active restoration
actions relevant to maintaining or improving the coastal defense service of coral reefs include
biological restoration, physical restoration, and artificial reefs (Figure 3.5).

Active biological restoration focuses on recovering or rebuilding the coral species diversity and
structure of a degraded reef-coral ecosystem. Stony coral populations are seen as the essential
keystone species of the coral reef ecosystem, thus most restoration focuses on them and not on
sponges, soft corals, and other mobile and sessile invertebrates that are also part of the reef
ecosystem. The most common biological restoration intervention has been the direct in-situ
transplantation of stony corals from donor reef sites to degraded reef sites. The establishment of
an underwater coral nursery (either in situ or ex situ) can improve survivorship of transplants by
reducing stress and stabilizing them before outplanting. Further, donor colonies can be
subdivided into smaller colonies through asexual fragmentation thereby increasing the number
of transplants. The size of coral outplants positively increases survivorship. Another biological
restoration technique that has been successfully applied is the collection of coral gametes and
sperm using fine-mesh nets placed around corals during periods of spawning. Settlement of the
fertilized coral planulae onto small limestone tiles or fragments is done in a lab or in situ over a
period of 24 to 72 hours. Settled coral spat are then seeded onto the degraded reef site,
although survivorship is often very low compared to coral nursery efforts that transplant larger-
sized corals. The costs and benefits of each of these proven techniques vary and many of them
are still largely within the academic sector and not yet adopted by managers and policy makers.

Physical restoration involves repairing or adding to the structural integrity of the reef framework,
typically with some combination of limestone and cement. The structural integrity of the reef
(width, height) is one of the most important features to consider in the context of coastal
defense. Acute physical impacts to the reef crest result from ship groundings, coral mining, blast

fishing and major storm events, causing fractures through the limestone matrix, craters, loss of
live coral, coralline algae, and the overall reduction in reef rugosity. Without active physical
restoration interventions, the degraded reef-crest surface deteriorates further from secondary
impacts. For example, displaced coral heads can continue to break apart and move around,
causing further damage or rates of physical erosion to back reef areas may increase from larger
waves getting through the reef. Coral reef damage-response plans with provisions for assessing
damage, removing grounded objects, or cleaning (in cases where removal is not feasible) only
exist in some countries and territories. Further, the legal frameworks for applying fines to cover
the costs for physical restoration are often weak or nonexistent. Most examples of physical
restoration of a reef crest come from the United States. One of the largest physical restoration
projects took place in the Florida Keys using concrete and limestone to rebuild the shallow reef
buttresses following the grounding of a large vessel (Precht et al. 2005).

Related to physical restoration, such artificial structures as limestone blocks, rock piles, molded
cement, steel, wood, tires, and other materials are placed on the seafloor. The majority of artificial
reef projects have been designed for fisheries production, tourism, or coral regeneration (Fabian
et al. 2014). When used for coastal defense, artificial structures immediately increase reef relief
and topographic complexity where they are placed, providing direct and short-term wave and
erosion reduction benefits. However, artificial structure projects are riskier than strictly biological
restoration projects. Poorly designed structures can become dislodged during storms, break
apart, and cause further damage to the reef and coastal infrastructure. They can pose both a
navigational hazard and an aesthetic impact to the area. Detailed environmental impact
assessments and permits from municipal and national permitting agencies and the local
community are essential. Overall, artificial structure projects require detailed planning and
should incorporate the professional expertise of coastal engineers and restoration specialists in
their design and construction (Sheppard and Gomez 2007).

3.6| Engineered Structures
Engineered structures designed to reduce wave energy in developed coastal areas include a
variety of riprap, breakwaters, and groins composed mainly of rock and concrete (for example,
USACE 2002). A main difference of engineered structures from artificial reefs is that engineered
structures are primarily designed to meet the demand for people living along the coasts with
limited regard to natural benefits. Indeed, engineered structures can cause environmental
damage by removing natural habitat and altering circulation and sediment transport to adjacent
habitats (Martin et al. 2005; Chapman and Underwood 2011). Poorly designed breakwaters and
groins can further degrade coastal habitats and displace erosion problems to other sections of
coastline. Engineered hard structures can also require substantial constructions and annual
maintenance costs. Two of the more important design considerations for engineered structures
that influence the natural outcomes include placement and materials.

The placement of engineered structures on the seabed is one of the most critical aspects that
directly influences wave and current patterns affecting shorelines. Detailed assessment of the
existing bathymetry and wave and current dynamics are often necessary to properly design the
size and placement of engineered structures. However, high-resolution (less than 1 meter) and
accurate bathymetry data to enable such analyses is often lacking in most tropical island
location. The result can be poorly located structures or overbuilding with large footprints, all of
which can have further negative impacts on the reef ecosystem. Traditional or gray breakwaters
built for marinas or in front of hotel beaches may be built well above mean high tide mark and
have few breaks or gaps to enable circulation and flushing critical to support marine life. Outer




                                                 64
                                    www.wavespartnership.org



breakwater walls constructed of either precast concrete modules or large armor rock weighing
several tons each often require large barges and deep-water access, which can cause other
secondary impacts, such as dredging. Traditional artificial breakwaters are also often
constructed in sandy back-reef settings where they may sink over time, losing their defensive
function and requiring higher maintenance costs. Advances in the use of geotextiles to underlay
artificial structures have addressed some of these issues, but burial by horizontally shifting sand
may make these sandy back reef areas less suitable for biological growth.

The material used in engineered reef structures is also critical to their overall performance
(durability and stability) and influences their function with respect to attracting aquatic organisms
and compatibility with the marine environment (Lukens and Selberg 2004). Large armor stones or
precast concrete units are the most commonly used materials for traditionally built breakwaters for
waves of 5 meters or more (Palmer and Christian1998). Other commonly available materials, such
as used tires, fly ash, and plastic, are no longer favored because they can leach chemicals or must
be anchored securely because of their light weight. Of increasing preference are nature-based
materials incorporating natural coral skeletons, rubble, or biologically friendly materials, such as
pH-neutral concrete or lightweight concrete with an organic matter matrix to accelerate biological
colonization (Guilbeau et. al. 2003). More than 44 types of artificial “modules” have been patented
in the United States alone (Lukens and Selberg 2004). The most common artificial reef modules
applicable to coastal defense are Reef Balls TM constructed of concrete (often pH-neutral), Ecoreefs
TM
   made from ceramic, and BioRock TM constructed of steel with added electro-deposition (UNEP,
2009). Although designed more for reef restoration purposes, these modules and materials are
increasingly being applied by coastal engineers for wave reduction and erosion control purposes.
Reef Balls TM have now been used in a variety of coastal defense applications with more than
500,000 deployed worldwide. As reviewed by Fabian et al. (2014), most of these materials and
techniques are expensive and do promote biological encrustation, but lack evidence of their
longer-term durability and function for coastal defense applications. In addition, there are few
examples of these artificial modules used in environments with high wave energy.

There is a growing recognition within the coastal engineering field that building with nature, as
opposed to against it, can provide significantly greater benefits overall (for example, USACE
2013). Factors for incorporating nature into engineered structures for coastal defense include
(i) considering the biomorphology and geohydrology of the seabed, (ii) taking into account
existing and potential nature values, and (iii) making use of materials and forces present in nature
(Waterman 2008). Engineered breakwaters designed with natural principles and restoration in
mind to emulate the natural coral reef value and function may be considered “softer” or “greener”
(Figure 3.6) and may have a broader positive restoration benefit. Design characteristics may
include a smaller footprint (both extent and width), lower and more natural height (for example,
submerged rather than emergent), and gaps or breaks between structures to promote flushing
and circulation. The placement of the structures may also be dictated more by the natural
geomorphology of the reef platform where biological growth may be more favored. Materials for
green breakwaters could include natural limestone blocks or stones from the area that provide a
variety of voids or spaces to promote internal and external colonization and provide habitat. The
profile, shape, and materials of the breakwater may also promote coral growth and encrustation
by crustose coralline algae over time. Transplanting affected live coral fragments back to the
breakwater structure after construction might also speed up the colonization process. The
Nature Conservancy is currently involved in a pilot project to design and construct a natural
submerged breakwater that promotes coral and crustose coralline algae colonization in a
shallow high-energy reef setting in Grenada.

As coastal engineering moves toward more sustainable, nature-based designs, advances in
materials are also enabling a more-flexible approach to the hard infrastructural for coastal
defense (Figure 3.6; see Temmerman et al. 2013 and references therein). Although there will be
tradeoffs compared to traditional breakwaters, these more natural submerged breakwaters can
still provide significant wave protection and beach sand retention benefits with the added
benefits of fisheries production, tourism, and biodiversity. While it is encouraging to see greener
engineering approaches to coastal defense, they should not be seen as a substitute for healthy
coral reefs that can accrete and keep up with sea level rise over time. Development designs that
are more holistic in their thinking beyond just the immediate construction footprint are

necessary. Including the preservation of intact healthy reefs with reef restoration and coastal
zone management in project designs will help address some of the longer-term issues that are
causing declines in coral reefs.

3.7| Cost Effectiveness of Coral Reef Restoration
Ferrario et al. (2014) provide insight into the cost effectiveness of coral reef restoration when
compared to the building of traditional breakwaters. They showed that the observed wave-
attenuation values by coral reefs in the field were similar to those of constructed low-crested
breakwaters. In their review they found that the typical costs of building tropical breakwaters
ranged from $456 to $188,817 per meter with a median project cost of $19,791 per meter. These
values were largely derived from U.S. Army Corp of Engineers projects. The costs of structural
coral reef restoration projects were $20 to $155,000 per meter with a median project cost of
$1,290 per meter. On average, reef restoration was significantly less expensive than building
tropical breakwaters.

The findings from Ferrario et al. (2014) are consistent with recent analyses from the re-insurance
industry on the economics of climate adaptation in eight Caribbean nations (CCRIF 2010). They
examined the costs and benefits of 20 approaches for coastal risk reduction, including
adaptation, reef restoration, engineered defenses, and policy changes. They found that reef
restoration was always more cost effective than breakwaters across all eight nations. Moreover,
in seven of eight nations, reef restoration was one of the most cost effective of all approaches.

3.8| Conclusions
Coral reefs are shown to be efficient natural breakwaters that can form an important first line of
defense against natural threats for coastal nations. Estimates indicate that more than 200 million
people benefit from reduced risk of coastal flooding as a result of coral reefs. Improved
methodologies and higher resolution data sets, such as bathymetry, will allow a better
accounting of a coral reef’s true economic “risk reduction” value. Reducing threats to coral reefs
and improving management efforts offer the most cost-effective solutions to retaining a reef’s
coastal protection services. Coral reef restoration science continues to improve and can provide
effective solutions to coral reef degradation at small spatial scales, particularly in areas near large
population centers. Combining coral enhancement and nature-based artificial structures into
sustainable coastal defense designs can provide multiple benefits over traditional gray designs.
Restoration projects that incorporate coastal community values into the overall design can also
contribute to longer term success.

4| Ecosystem Service and Coastal Engineering Tools for
Coastal Protection and Risk Reduction
Kristy J. Kroeker,c Borja G. Reguero,c,d Pamela Rittelmeyer,c and Michael W. Beckd

4.1| Summary
This chapter provides an overview of several common tools and approaches used to assess risks
from flooding and erosion, and to estimate coastal protection benefits from natural habitats. The
methods for estimating the role and value of natural habitats in coastal protection and risk
reduction are diverse but mainly fall into two broad categories of index-based approaches and
process-resolving approaches (including numerical models) and vary considerably in their ease
of use, complexity, and accuracy. This guidance note reviews both (i) the common coastal
ecosystem service tools and (ii) the engineering tools, models and approaches for estimating
coastal risks and the role of habitat (and other infrastructure) in reducing erosion and flooding to
avert economic and social damages. It highlights how these approaches can address the role of
coastal habitats in reducing erosion and flooding to avert economic and social damages.

This guidance note recommends using process-based approaches in general and further
recommends an Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach for valuing the coastal protection
services from reefs and mangroves. The EDF is adapted from approaches commonly used in
engineering and insurance to assess risks and benefits. There are five core steps to estimating
coastal protection benefits from any kind of infrastructure: (i) estimate offshore hydrodynamics
(wind, waves, and sea levels); (ii) Estimate nearshore hydrodynamics; (iii) Estimate effects of
coastal structures (habitat) on hydrodynamics; (iv) Estimate flooding or erosion; and (v) Assess
expected and averted damages (that is, value coastal protection benefits).

Together, these five steps constitute a process of sequential steps that allow assessment of
coastal habitat protection benefits in terms of damages averted by conserving or restoring the
habitats. Engineers commonly use these steps to estimate coastal hazards and assess
infrastructure alternatives for risk reduction (for example, dikes); the insurance industry also uses
them to assess climate risks and adaptation alternatives.

4.2| Introduction
Ecosystems support human societies in many ways. For example, ecosystems in the coastal
zone support fisheries, protect coastlines, and provide opportunities for tourism and recreation.
Ecosystem service tools have been developed to model the roles that natural habitats play in
supporting human livelihoods and wellbeing (Bagstad et al. 2013; Vigerstol and Aukema 2011).
Many tools provide explicit spatial maps of ecosystem services that allow decision makers to
evaluate trade-offs between development and protection of natural habitats (Naidoo et al.
2008). Such methods for estimating the economic value of ecosystem services can also
incorporate costs avoided or savings afforded by natural habitat, which serve as additional aids
in making decisions (Daily et al. 2009).

Estimates of coastal protection services are often derived by calculating the effect of natural
habitats on flooding or erosion. Several tools and approaches model the coastal protection and
risk reduction services from natural habitats, such as coral reefs and mangroves. These tools and

frameworks can be separated into two main categories based on their approach to estimating
coastal protection: index-based approaches and process-resolving approaches.

Index-based approaches use estimates of exposure and vulnerability to assess risk and risk
reduction benefits. These indices can be (re)calculated using different configurations of natural
habitats or other environmental conditions (for example, sea level) to estimate potential changes in
risk or benefits. For example, the Coastal Vulnerability Module of InVEST (Arkema et al. 2013) uses
an index-based approach to create an index to assess shorelines most at risk to flooding. It scores
seven variables—such as winds, wave surge, sea level, and type of habitat—on a scale of one to five
to indicate exposure of the shoreline.

Process-resolving approaches, on the other hand, define meteo-oceanographic variables, such
as waves, storm surges, currents, tides and sea level, and examine coastal processes, such as
sediment transport and interactions between waves and structures to assess risks and the value
of habitats in reducing exposure. Process-resolving approaches can be further delineated into
analytical approximations and numerical models. Analytical approximations of coastal processes
or semi-empirical formulations have low computing capacity requirements and are affordable to
implement at large scales (for example, propagation of waves over vegetation fields, such as
Mendez and Losada, 2004; or run-up formulations, such as Nielsen and Hanslow 1991).
Numerical models can resolve coastal processes with higher accuracy. Depending on the scope
of the study, various numerical models can be applied to deal with the different processes
involved in coastal hazards and risk reduction.
More complex and accurate tools require more technical expertise and computing capacity, which
can limit the geographic scale at which process-resolving tools are used. Thus, the geographic
scope of the analysis often defines which approach is used to estimate coastal risks and protection
benefits (Figure 4.1). Global or national-scale analyses often use index-based approaches that
combine hydrodynamic (for example, mean significant wave height), geophysical (for example,
geological features), and socioeconomic (for example, population density) data into a unique
metric or index (for example, USGS Coastal Vulnerability Index; InVEST Coastal Vulnerability
Index). Local-, regional-, and some global-scale studies use process-resolving approaches that
numerically model factors, such as wave propagation, onshore flooding, or sediment movement.
Process-resolving approaches provide more detailed results than integrated indices; however, they
require more technical expertise. Thus, process-resolving approaches are sometimes included in
large-scale assessments of coastal protection values, benefits, and services by using analytical
equations for ideal conditions or semi-empirical models, but these approaches are less accurate
than those approaches that use numerical models at a local scale.

A number of generalized tools use index-based or process-resolving approaches for estimating
coastal risks and coastal protection benefits (Appendix 4.1). Many approaches sit between
general ecosystem service tools and more complex coastal engineering approaches that rely
upon numerical models. Within the range of process-resolving models, however, tools can differ
substantially in complexity and accuracy.

4.3| Methods and results
First, this chapter reviews a range of ecosystem service tools and approaches that estimate
coastal protection and risk reduction by natural habitats, such as mangroves and coral reefs
(Appendix 4.1). It highlights both general and multi-ecosystem service tools, as well as tools or
approaches specifically focused on estimating coastal protection services. For each tool, it
examines the aim, scale, data needs, and ease of use of each tool. It also examines case studies
and documentation pertinent to coastal protection applications of each tool.

Although numerous tools have been developed to map vulnerability and exposure to coastal
hazards, such as storm surges and sea level rise, this chapter specifically emphasizes tools that
examine how natural habitats affect coastal protection services. It focuses on tools that are
publicly accessible, namely: InVEST, ARIES, MIMES, Coastal Resilience, RiVAMP, Climada, and
the Coastal Capital Project Framework. It does not discuss other well-known ecosystem service
tools, because at publication time these tools could not easily be used to model coastal
protection from natural habitats (for example, Atlantis; Benefits Estimation Toolkit; EcoServ;
Ecosystem Portfolio Model; Envision; ESR; SERVES). Tools that are primarily used for visualizing
hazards are not reviewed (for example, Surging Seas or National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration [NOAA’s] Sea Level Rise Viewer), but could be used to identify areas for more
in-depth modeling of coastal protection using other tools. A more comprehensive list of
visualization tools can be found at the Digital Coast portal.2

Second, this chapter describes the steps involved in more in-depth, coastal engineering-based
approaches for examining how coastal structures (natural or artificial) affect flooding and
erosion. It highlights some of the most common coastal engineering tools and approaches used
to estimate risks and assess alternative scenarios for risk reduction or coastal protection. Some of
these tools either already include natural habitats and address those habitats’ role in erosion and
flooding reduction or could be easily modified to do so. In addition, the chapter discusses
numerical models in coastal engineering practice that can be used for in-depth examinations of

4.4| General Ecosystem Service Tools—Measuring Multiple Ecosystem Services

Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)
InVEST was developed to model and map a wide variety of ecosystem services within a
specified geography to help users understand the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated
with management or policy decisions (Sharp et al. 2014). The Marine InVEST tool focuses
specifically on ocean and coastal ecosystem services and can be paired with a valuation
module to estimate economic gains or losses based on various habitat management scenarios.
Marine InVEST provides information on how the protection or restoration of coastal
ecosystems, such as coral reefs, marshes, or mangroves, reduces both societal risks and
economic costs in the coastal zone. There are two modules within InVEST that are relevant to
coastal protection and risk reduction: the Coastal Vulnerability Module and the Coastal
Protection Module.

The Coastal Vulnerability Module is an index-based tool that maps areas of high or low
vulnerability to coastal hazards. The vulnerability of a shoreline is based on seven variables:
geomorphology, relief, presence of natural habitats, sea level rise, as well as wind, wave, and
surge exposure.3 While the tool does not provide quantitative valuation of protection (for
example, economic values for shoreline protection from natural habitats), the change in shoreline
exposure score can be examined relative to the density of people and property potentially
affected (for example, Arkema et al. 2013). The Coastal Vulnerability Module is a relatively
general tool compared to the Coastal Protection Module, and it does not take into account local
ocean processes, such as sediment transport.

Arkema et al. (2013) used the Coastal Vulnerability Module to estimate the vulnerability of the
U.S. coastline to storms and sea-level rise with and without natural habitats. The authors created
a coastal hazard indicator and identified areas of highest vulnerability along the U.S. coastline. In
addition, the Coastal Vulnerability Module has been employed in Monterey Bay, California, to
demonstrate how the protection of coastal dunes and wetlands could reduce the vulnerability of
coastal infrastructure, populations, and farmland to flooding and erosion from ocean storms or
rising sea levels (Langridge et al. 2014). The Coastal Vulnerability Module has also been used to
rank risk of coastal hazard in areas of Rhode Island, and to examine vulnerability from
destruction of mangrove forests in the Bahamas.

The Coastal Protection Module models how reefs (coral and oyster) and wetlands (mangroves,
marshes, or seagrass) attenuate waves and reduce erosion or flooding.4 It is a process-based tool
that allows users to develop scenarios and examine impacts on coastal protection benefits. The
output is easily accessible (for example, wave height or water levels before and after a
management action), and can include a table summarizing the economic values of damages to
coastal properties and infrastructure that could be avoided through natural habitat protection or
restoration.5 Estimates of the beach nourishment costs accrued or avoided due to the presence
or absence of natural habitats are in development.

The Coastal Protection Module requires relief data about the coastal zone (for example,
bathymetry and topography) and wind-wave input from past records of wind and wave heights
for the given location. General wind-wave input can be obtained through Operational Wave
datasets (for example, NOAA WAVEWATCH III databases6 or the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts) or the different wave re-analyses available worldwide (for example,
Reguero et al. 2012; Rascle and Arduin 2013). All other inputs require some parameterization.
Some people and property asset data are available through Marine InVEST, although the general
asset data can be improved upon with finer-scale data for given locations. For example, InVEST
provides global population data, but the user is encouraged to input more detailed census data.

The first step of the Coastal Protection Module is to run the submodel Profile Generator to obtain
a cross-shore profile that contains bathymetry and backshore information for a given location. A
Digital Elevation Model with a vertical elevation referenced to Mean Lower Low Water is
necessary, if the user wants the GIS to cut a cross-shore transect. The user may input more
detailed information on bathymetry and coastal habitats.

The second step of the Coastal Protection Module is to run the submodel for nearshore waves
and erosion. The user can choose to input wave height and wave period values, or wind speed,
fetch distance, and water depth. In order to compute economic values for costs accrued or
avoided due to natural habitats, the model requires the length of the natural habitat types,
coverage, and management actions (for example, restoration or dike building) to calculate the
extent of land loss or flooding. The economic valuation also requires information about local
property values, typical return period of storms in the study area, appropriate discount rate (that
is, accounting for the future value of today’s dollar), and the number of years the user intends to
value the coastal protection provided by the habitat.

Although early versions of InVEST required ArcGIS, most modules now use free, open-source
code in a stand-alone platform that can be launched in a Windows operating system. The
Coastal Protection Module, however, still requires ArcGIS to run the model (Sharp et al. 2014).
Both InVEST modules are well documented. The interface and output are user-friendly, requiring
less training than many other tools.

Mobile Bay, Alabama, Puget Sound, Washington, and the Florida Keys are using the Coastal
Protection Module to examine wave attenuation and habitat restoration options. Further
documentation for the use of the Coastal Protection Module is in development, including
examples in Galveston Bay, Texas and the Hawaiian Islands (Guannel pers. comm.).

Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES)
ARIES is a general ecosystem service tool developed to model multiple ecosystem services,
including, but not limited to, risk reduction from coastal flooding. ARIES differs fundamentally in
its approach from InVEST because it does not use biophysical relationships to model coastal risk
reduction. Instead, it uses probabilistic relationships based on historical data to spatially link
biophysical units (for example, tons of sediment) and abstract units (for example, soil retention).

ARIES is flexible enough to accommodate multiple ecosystem services, and it allows the user to
spatially map the uncertainty associated with the model output, a feature not available in many
of the other ecosystem service tools. In addition, ARIES is being developed to include
generalized models so it can be used in data-poor contexts where local data are not available
(Villa et al. 2014).

                                 Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



ARIES is designed to include several approaches to estimate the economic value of ecosystem
services. In one approach, the user enters values for multiple services, which are then paired with
user-defined priority-based weights. Alternatively, a future version of the tool is being developed
to include monetary values from an ecosystem services database so that users can access
economic valuation studies from their region (Bagstad et al. 2011). Information on ecosystem
service flows can be incorporated to translate previously assessed economic values of specific
benefits into valuations as required by the user.7

The Coastal Flood Regulation Module is the most relevant module in ARIES for modeling coastal
protection from coral reefs and mangroves. It uses historical data from storms to build statistical
relationships between wave exposure, coastal habitats, and the impacts on people and
infrastructure. Although ARIES relies on Bayesian modeling, it also incorporates some proxies for
coastal processes. For example, storm surge values are defined as high when there are high
winds, low barometric pressure, and shallow water depths. The output from the Coastal Flood
Regulation Module includes the storm surge height above sea level for a simulated future storm
(Johnson and Bagstad 2012), as well as the number of people or assets spared from coastal
flooding.

ARIES currently does not provide an economic valuation of these particular ecosystem services,
but the developers are working to include them in future versions. Other future improvements
might include shifts in storm direction.

At this time, the Coastal Flood Regulation Module in ARIES is still at a proof-of-concept stage,
where the output may be less reliable than other tools. While the reliability of the module might
benefit from the inclusion of local data and additional biophysical process models, these
enhancements are likely to decrease its usability.

At present, ARIES is an open-source, stand-alone modeling platform still in development. The
developers intend to create a Web-based tool in the future (Bagstad pers. comm.). Currently, use
of the tool requires participation in an ARIES training course or a formal partnership with the
ARIES development team.

ARIES, which has both technical and nontechnical interfaces, does not require special
programming skills. The user starts by choosing the geographic region. The model then presents
a rule engine—a nominal interview process—where the user chooses which data to include. This
process allows ARIES to identify the user’s priorities and determine which models will aid in
making decisions. Users can explore scenarios that vary the availability of the ecosystem service
factors. A working knowledge of Bayesian statistics will aid interpretation.

ARIES has been used in several temperate and tropical ecosystems, although there is limited
documentation for use in coastal protection. For example, Wendland et al. (2010) examined the
role of forests in carbon sequestration and storage, sediment regulation, subsistence fisheries,
and coastal flood regulation by linking the terrestrial and marine ecosystem service models to
inform planning decision and conservation efforts on the island of Madagascar (Wendland et al.
2010). ARIES is at work in the Chehalis River Basin in Washington to examine the role of natural
habitats in flood protection in response to catastrophic riverine floods (Batker et al. 2010).
Likewise, Mexico has used ARIES to explore the hydrological services of upstream cloud forests
in a small watershed where a payment for ecological services (PES) system is in place.8

Multiscale Integrated Models of Ecosystem Services (MIMES)
MIMES is another spatially explicit, general ecosystem service tool. It is publicly available, but is
not as well documented as InVEST and ARIES (Bagstad et al. 2013). It is place specific, and a long
lead-time is required for first runs in new locations, because a highly technical user or a
consultant needs to program it (Bagstad et al. 2013). Early versions of MIMES have been used in
Massachusetts, the Mississippi Delta, Texas, Washington, and Russia. It is currently under
development in Cambodia with the goal of tracking how humans interact with natural systems
over time (Berdik 2014). To date, each module of the application is made for a specific purpose.
For instance, the Austin, Texas, project modeled the potential effects of climate change (for
example, extreme heat) on human health at a local scale, as well as possible mitigation
approaches (Boumans et al. 2014). To date, no documentation exists for the use of MIMES to
specifically estimate coastal protection services from natural habitats. Data outputs must be
post-processed in GIS to be visualized. The model can also be integrated with R software for
more statistical analysis (Boumans pers. comm.).

4.5| General Coastal Risk and Vulnerability Tools
The following general tools are primarily focused on estimating coastal risk reduction. They may
consider additional ecosystem services, but do not usually measure them explicitly.

Coastal Resilience tool
The Coastal Resilience tool aims to assess the social and economic risks associated with storms
and sea level rise and identify natural and nature-based solutions to help reduce these risks
(Ferdana et al. 2010; Gilmer and Ferdana 2012; Beck et al. 2013). The Coastal Resilience tool
utilizes ESRI’s ArcGIS API for JavaScript. It has a modular plug-in architecture that allows for
applications (hereafter, referred to as apps) to be developed for specific risk and vulnerability
coastal issues and to help identify risk reduction solutions. Several interactive apps help users
assess risks from regional to national scales.

     i.	   The Risk Explorer app is based on the Coastal Vulnerability Module of InVEST (Arkema et
           al. 2013, see above). In addition to the exposure variables considered in Coastal
           Vulnerability Module, it also incorporates social vulnerability metrics, such as percent of
           people living below poverty level. It is currently available nationwide in the United States.
     ii.	 The Restoration Explorer app allows users to identify priority areas for reef and wetland
          conservation and restoration that would reduce social vulnerability from erosion and flooding.
     iii.	 The Coastal Defense app directly measures coastal protection services. It examines how
           coral reefs, mangroves, marshes, oyster reefs, seagrasses, and dikes can reduce wave
           height, water level, and loss of fine sediments in coastal areas.9 It runs a modified version of
           the Coastal Protection Module from InVEST and provides a user-friendly interface to this
           module. All of the input parameters required by the Coastal Protection Module are pre-
           processed, and the user then selects where to run the module (that is which transects),
           under what conditions (averages, strong storm, or maximum for the area), and can add
           height or width to reefs and wetlands (that is, design a restoration scenario). The app helps
           users identify the wave attenuation or coastal protection value of existing reef and wetland
           habitats and allows users to design restoration solutions and assess their coastal protection
           values in terms of wave attenuation. The Coastal Defense app provides numerical estimates

          of the percent reduction in wave height for scenarios with and without natural habitats, but
          does not currently estimate the economic values accrued or avoided in these scenarios.
The Coastal Resilience tool runs globally and is scalable. That is, there are applications that work
globally and then at increasingly greater detail regionally (for example, Mesoamerican Reef),
nationally (Grenada, St. Vincent, United States), subnationally (for example, Gulf of Mexico) and
locally (for example, Florida Keys). The Coastal Defense app works across all major reef and
wetland habitats (that is, the model is general), but it is currently only running at full scale in
certain U.S. geographies. It is being developed to work globally (Z. Ferdana pers. comm.) and is
rapidly being expanded in tropical geographies. The app is designed on open source technology,
and all codes are available on GitHub.10

Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Methodology Development Project (RiVAMP)
The RiVAMP provides a framework for estimating disaster and risk reduction from coastal
habitats in the coastal zone by incorporating ecosystems and climate change in the risk
assessment process. This framework uses a range of numerical and spatially explicit models to
highlight how ecological and environmental factors, such as coastal habitats and climate change
(for example, sea-level rise and storm surges associated with extreme tropical cyclones), could
affect beach erosion, coastal populations, and infrastructure (Chatenoux et al. 2012).

Beyond the attention to coastal ecosystems and environmental factors, the RiVAMP framework
considers important social factors in its assessment process, including local livelihoods and
environmental governance.

RiVAMP’s pilot initiative in Jamaica described the role of coral reefs and seagrasses in risk
reduction in Negril, Jamaica—an urban tourist destination with high vulnerability to coastal hazards
(UNEP 2010). The pilot study used a combination of numerical and geospatial models to do the
following: (i) map coastal ecosystems and beach erosion over time; (ii) numerically model wave
and sea-level dynamics over reefs; (iii) establish the effect of ecosystems on beach erosion using
multiple regression from 74 beach profiles; and (iv) apply scenarios of sea level rise through model
ensembles to estimate exposure to beach loss and flooding. In particular, GIS was used to analyze
the widths of the beaches and compare them with the minimum and maximum changes under
several sea-level rise and storm-surge scenarios. The RiVAMP study “clearly demonstrate[d] the
critical services that coastal ecosystems provide to the Negril beach” (UNEP 2010).

RiVAMP does not provide a user interface, but the approach is replicable using a variety of tools.
Essentially, it represents an approach to modeling coastal risk reduction that relies on a
combination of tools, data, and expertise. The spatially explicitly nature of the modeling approach
requires a GIS platform and, similar to other spatially explicit mapping tools, RiVAMP requires a
Digital Elevation Model for the given location. In addition, the user must provide maps of coastal
habitats and information about the distribution of ecosystems, as well as the distributions of
human population and assets distribution for the location of interest. All other inputs (tides, sea
level rise projections, storm surge, wave run-up for population, asset exposure, beach slope, grain
size of sand, and wave characteristics for beach erosion) require user parameterization.

Climada
Climada is a tool that can assess risk from wind and storm surge and perform a cost/benefit
analysis of risk reduction measures following the Economics of Climate Adaptation

(ECA) methodology (ECA 2009). Climada was not designed to be an ecosystem service tool per
se, but it does assess economic losses from coastal hazards and the role of natural habitats (and
other measures) in reducing these losses. If the damage avoided because of coastal ecosystems
is parameterized in the loss function, Climada can assess the protection value of the ecosystem
services provided by coastal habitats. It can include further information on the values of other
ecosystem services, such as fisheries, carbon sequestration, and recreation (Reguero et al. 2014).
Outputs of Climada include cost/benefit curves of representative adaptation measures, which
may be particularly useful for national accounting.11

Climada is developed in Matlab, which requires technical knowledge and programming skills.
Documentation is available online, in Github,12 and through demonstrations. Case studies include
analyses of risk reduction from tropical cyclones in South Florida, United States, climate
adaptation in the Caribbean (CCRIF 2010), and coastal risks and nature-based defenses in the
Gulf of Mexico (Reguero et al. 2014).

Coastal Capital Project Framework
The World Resources Institute (WRI) developed a detailed framework to analyze the benefits of
coral reefs and mangroves, including their role in shoreline protection. This approach, defined in
the Coastal Capital Project (CCP), has been used in five Caribbean nations: Belize, the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.13 This series of economic valuation studies
is an example of international, national, and regional collaboration using a consistent framework
with common rules. It specifically addresses coastal protection from coral reefs and mangroves,
among other services, through analysis of scenarios of indicators or indices.

As an example, the analysis in Jamaica used a detailed hydrodynamic model to determine the
relationship between coral reef height and physical condition on wave attenuation in three
representative areas of coastline. It then used GIS to assess reef types, complexity, and distances
to shoreline, as well as land elevation and complexity for the entire island. It next grouped the
segments of the coastline with similar reefs to the representative reefs in the detailed
hydrodynamic models into categories of coastal protection (low, medium, and high).

WRI developed a guidebook and valuation toolkit for the CCP case studies in the Caribbean. The
toolkit includes an Excel spreadsheet to guide the valuation of fisheries, tourism, and marine
protected areas and a detailed discussion of how to evaluate shoreline protection with a GIS
(WRI 2009). The general process to value shoreline protection includes identifying land that is
vulnerable to wave-induced erosion and storm damage based on distance to the shoreline and
elevation, identifying coastline that is within a certain distance from coral reefs or mangroves,
ranking the physical stability of the shoreline, and estimating the damages to property value
avoided when coral reefs or mangroves are present. The case studies were performed entirely in
GIS. WRI developed separate GIS-based methodologies to evaluate the benefits of coral reefs
and mangroves to fisheries and tourism (WRI 2009; Burke et al. 2008; Cooper et al. 2009).
Sheppard et al. (2005) used the CCP to examine the relationship between coral reef decline and
increase in beach erosion, with an output into an Excel spreadsheet (Wielgus et al. 2010).

process from stakeholder engagement to analysis and outreach, using language suitable for

both economists and noneconomists.14 The guidebook describes the scoping process, and
provides guidance for including the various stakeholders in the process and identifying policy
questions. It also leads the user through the process of developing scenarios, choosing a
valuation method, accounting for risk and uncertainty, and applying decision support tools. The
guidebook concludes by detailing how to clearly communicate the results to decision makers
and others. Each phase of the guidebook emphasizes stakeholder engagement.

Summary of general ecosystem services tools and approaches
Each of these tools and approaches can be used to estimate the risk reduction afforded by coastal
habitats, although they vary considerably in their data requirements and ease of use (see Appendix
4.1 for a breakdown of these factors). In practice, the Coastal Vulnerability and Coastal Protection
modules in InVEST, which form the foundation for the Coastal Resilience tools, are currently the
most accessible and widely used tools for estimating risk reduction from natural habitats. Similarly,
the Coastal Capital Project Framework represents an accessible framework for linking erosion and
flooding damage to economic benefits afforded by risk reduction in broader valuations.

4.6| Engineering Tools and Models: Process-based Approaches for Assessing
Coastal Protection
Process-based approaches for estimating coastal protection vary from general approaches to
highly detailed numerical models. For all these approaches, there are five core steps that are
central to estimating coastal protection benefits from any kind of infrastructure:

1.	 Estimate Offshore Hydrodynamics (waves and surge)
2.	 Estimate Nearshore Hydrodynamics as they interact with the coastline
3.	 Estimate Effects of Coastal Structures (Habitat) on hydrodynamics
4.	 Estimate Onshore Flooding or Erosion
5.	 Assess Expected and Averted Damages from Flooding or Erosion (Figure 4.2).
Together, these five steps allow an assessment of coastal habitat protection benefits in terms of
damages averted by conserving or restoring the habitats. Each of these five steps represents a
different type of problem to be solved, and there is a suite of tools and models for solving each
(see Table 4.1 and Appendix 4.2). These steps are commonly used by engineers to estimate
coastal risks and assess infrastructure alternatives for risk reduction (for example, dikes), as well
as by the insurance industry to assess climate risks and adaptation alternatives (for example,
CCRIF 2010; ECA 2009).

These five steps are first described in general and then there are short descriptions of the coastal
engineering tools commonly used in steps one to four (Table 4.1). The fifth step (Assess
Expected and Averted Damages) is discussed here and also in Chapter 5 on economic valuation.
Most of the steps are the same for estimating benefits from any coastal habitat, including reefs
and mangroves. The third step addresses the interaction between waves and coastal habitat and
the equations are specific to each ecosystem type (that is, the equations for how waves interact
with intertidal vegetation are different than the equations for how waves interact with offshore
submerged breakwaters or reefs). This section recommends and describes an EDF approach to
assessing benefits from habitats (see Barbier 2007), but other approaches for estimating
economic values are also possible (for example, replacement costs) as explained in Chapter 5.

Figure 4.2: Conceptual Diagram of Process-based Steps for the Assessment of Flooding and the Role of
Habitats in Flood Reduction




There are two main outputs from this five-step approach. The first product is an assessment of
existing risk, which is usually expressed as the EDF, that is, as a relationship between expected
damages and storm frequencies (other hazard events such as earthquakes can also be
expressed in terms of their EDF). Storm frequencies are often characterized by the likelihood
that extreme storm conditions occur on average once every certain number of years and is
referred to as the return period of a storm (for example, once in 10-year storm).

The second product from this approach is a comparison of expected damage functions among
alternative scenarios, such as different coastal protection alternatives (for example, sea defenses,
shoreline restoration) or climate change hazards (for example, sea-level rise). The coastal
protection benefits of reef and mangrove habitats can be estimated as the difference in
expected damages associated with flooding (or erosion) levels among alternative scenarios.
These comparative results are sometimes referred to as averted damages (that is, the differences
between expected damages originating in alternative scenarios). Table 4.1 provides a list of many
of the coastal engineering tools used to study coastal processes and provides some guidance on
how to apply these tools to coral reefs and wetlands for each stage.

Description of steps to estimate coastal protection from habitats:

1. Estimate offshore hydrodynamics (waves and surge)
The study of coastal protection starts with the oceanographic conditions that generate waves
from wind in deep waters. Coastal applications also require an assessment of winds, waves, mean
sea level, tides, and storm surge. Databases and numerical models are available for each of these
variables (see Table 4.1). For example, for wave generation there are several models and numerical
databases to estimate these terms, such as WaveWatch III (Tolman 2002, 2014) (see Table 4.1).

A key result of this step is an assessment of both average and extreme offshore hydrodynamics
conditions in the region of study. The key data in assessing these conditions are (i) historical
records of past storm events, climatological and oceanic observation networks, (ii) observations
and measurements (for example, satellite and wave gauges), and (iii) modeled climatic
reconstructions (for example, NOAA National Climate Data Center15).

2. Estimate nearshore hydrodynamics
As soon as offshore waves approach and start to interact with the coastal environment, there is
another set of processes that need to be studied with a different suite of tools. Waves change
significantly throughout their propagation from deep to shallow waters because of interactions
with the bathymetry and coastal geometry (although other factors like wind transfer can also
affect the waves). In their propagation, waves experience refraction, dissipation, diffraction, and
other sources of energy transfer.

A key result from this step is a characterization of nearshore wave heights and energy. These
wave heights and energy are typically assessed across a range of average and extreme
conditions (for example, see USACE 2002; ECA 2009). One of the key datasets to acquire at this
stage is bathymetry. For regional- and global-scale analyses, the most common data sources are
ETOPO16 or GEBCO17 (approximately 1 km resolution). These bathymetry datasets are adequate
for large domains but cannot be used for local scale studies where shallow conditions are key for
the relevant process, such as refraction and breaking. It is usually desirable to find more high-
resolution bathymetry from nautical charts, surveys, or imagery (for example, Lidar) at local sites.

3. Estimate the effects of coastal structures (habitat) on hydrodynamics
Nearshore waves and surge then interact with habitats (or other structures), which results in wave
attenuation and wave energy reduction. The models for estimating the effects of offshore
structures (for example, reefs) and intertidal vegetation (for example, mangroves) are different. For
instance, coral reefs attenuate short waves (for example, wind waves) mainly through wave
breaking and wave energy dissipation, depending on relative depth, rugosity, and reef geometry
(see Chapter 3). In contrast, mangrove forests can attenuate both short-wave energy and long
waves (that is, storm surges) (see Chapter 2). Coral reefs can persist in high wave energy
environments, while mangrove forests are found in areas more protected from intense wave action.
The key result of this step is an evaluation of wave reduction resulting from the coastal habitats.

This step requires spatially explicit data on habitats. There is one relatively common set of global
data on the distribution of coral reef and mangrove habitats that are available from several
sources (see UNEP WCMC,18 World Resources Reefs at Risk,19 and Coastal Resilience20). In
addition to estimating the distribution it is also important to estimate crest height (for example,
using SeaWifs data21) and rugosity (see Sheppard et al. 2005) for reefs, and vegetation density

for mangroves (for example, Mendez and Losada 2004; Satyanarayana et al. 2011; Tusinski and
Verhagen 2014; Kamal et al. 2014). Some of the engineering models for estimating the effects of
habitats on wave and surge are identified in Table 4.1.

4. Estimate onshore flooding and erosion
After passing over habitats, the remaining wave energy is translated into levels of onshore
flooding or erosion. The models and equations for assessing erosion and flooding are different.
At present, most considerations of expected and averted damages focus on flooding
impacts and rarely assess erosion. This chapter briefly discusses how erosion can be estimated
here, but primarily focuses on flooding impacts in step five. For flooding, a key result of this step
is an assessment of onshore flooding levels relative to storm frequency (return periods).

4.1. Coastal flooding

Water levels along coastal shorelines vary through time. As a first order estimate, these water
levels can be defined by (i) average sea level conditions, including mean water level,
astronomical tides, storm surges, and wave setup, and (ii) fluctuating surf-beat from the
individual waves at the shoreline, usually referred to as wave run up, that is, height above mean
water elevation (USACE 2002). The run up is a very complex phenomenon that depends on the
local water level, the incident wave conditions (height, period, steepness, and direction), and the
nature of the structure (for example, slope, reflectivity, height, permeability, and roughness). All
of these factors above determine the potential for flooding. Flooding can be modeled in a variety
of ways depending on the scope and resolution needed for the study. As a first order estimate, a
bathtub approach is usually taken where the flood height (total water level) at the shore is
distributed across land based on topographic elevation creating a flooding envelope. More
complex flooding models take into account different land uses (for example, different rugosity),
duration of the events, or coastal defenses (for example, barriers and protections).

4.2. Coastal erosion

Coastal erosion is the wearing away of land and the removal of sediments by wave action, tidal
currents, wave currents, and high winds. Wind waves may cause coastal erosion in the long term
by provoking loss of sediment or the temporary redistribution of sediments (for example, under
storm conditions). Erosion is usually studied by modeling both the cross-shore (that is, beach
profile changes) and long-shore sediment transport (that is, beach platform variations). There
are also methods to study the problem over short temporal scales and to consider the full
three-dimensional complexity of the problem.

5. Assess expected and averted damages (value coastal protection benefits)
After flooding levels are modeled as a function of event frequency (for example, flood height
versus storm return period), the next step is to assess the damages or losses from the events.
The main analysis is a calculation of the people and assets within (“under”) the flooding
envelope (Figure 4.2). The expected damages can be adjusted by elevation with a
vulnerability curve that characterizes past observed relationships between flood height and
damage to structures. For example, a structure flooded by 0.5 meters of water will have less
percent damage than a structure flooded by two meters of water (for example, Scawthorn et
al. 2006a). The statistical relationship between these losses represents the expected damage
function. This curve is a key result of these analyses and serves to define the likely value of
assets flooded under different storm frequencies or return periods (for example, once in 10-,
100- and 500-year storms).

                              Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



Spatially explicit data regarding the distribution of assets and economic activity is necessary to
calculate the expected damage function (in particular by elevation). Spatially explicit information
about property values are often available in high-income countries, but often not available in
developing countries. In the absence of such data, one approach for assessing the distribution of
coastal assets for large-scale studies is to spatially allocate national or subnational GDP based on
population estimates, that is, translate exposed populations into exposed assets using an
estimate of produced capital per capita (World Bank 2010; Hallegatte et al. 2011, 2013). GDP
estimates are available from the World Bank and population estimates from several databases,
including World Pop,22GRUMP,23 or Landscan24. A dataset that already translates global gridded
GDP by population into exposed assets is currently available from UNEP-Grid and the World
Bank.25 G-Econ26 also provides geographically based economic data (Nordhaus 2005).
Although it is less common, it is possible to allocate GDP based on the distribution of
infrastructure from the global night-lights database (Henderson et al. 2011; Uchiyama and Mori
2015 discuss limitations in this approach).

Value coastal protection benefits. The final analysis in the assessment is the comparison of the
expected damages function under alternative habitat conservation and restoration scenarios
(for example, Reguero et al. 2014). For example, the restoration of mangroves or reefs will reduce
flood heights across a variety of storm frequencies (return periods) compared to the base
scenario, resulting in averted damages that can be estimated monetarily or in terms of the
number of people affected. The difference in the expected damage curves with and without
existing coastal habitats represents the current coastal protection benefit of the habitats
(Figure 4.2). The value of these benefits can be calculated either (i) by comparing the difference
in expected and averted damages at one or more specific storm return periods and/or (ii) by
integrating the area between the curves (Figure 4.2), which represents the average annual
averted damages (that is, the annual expected benefit from the habitats) (Olsen et al. 2015).

The approaches for estimating expected damages are common in the hazard management and
insurance industry (Understanding Risk 2014). Risk models—such as Climada (see previous
sections), CAPRA27 (World Bank) or HAZUS28 (Scawthorn et al. 2006b)—can inform the
protection benefit calculations, while other tools can be used to estimate costs and benefits (for
example, FEMA29; Climada).

Summary of coastal engineering tools and models
There are a wide range of tools and a rich history of practice for coastal protection modeling,
because many different sectors need to study, understand, and control coastal erosion and
flooding. Table 4.1 outlines some of the tools and models available for resolving the steps
described above (models and tools briefly described in Appendices 1 and 2). Although the
application of these approaches to reefs and wetlands is a more recent addition, there is
nothing entirely new about incorporating natural structures in such models. Many of the

models within each step share commonalities, and all cited here are widely employed in coastal
problem solving.

4.7| Summary and Advice
The approaches reviewed here can be applied across different scales for many ecosystems,
including coral reefs and mangroves, with a variety of tools that vary in scope and level of
accuracy. Importantly, the outputs of all approaches can be used for direct economic valuation
(see Chapter 5). Defining the right approach for each case, however, is important for ensuring the
most successful outcomes. Several considerations must be taken into account to determine
which ecosystem service or coastal engineering tool or approach is best suited to estimate the
role of natural habitats in coastal protection. Defining these factors can help users narrow the
choices and better understand the differences in methodologies. Key considerations to
identifying the appropriate approach are:

•	Purpose—Can the tool address the problem and provide suitable outcomes for economic
  valuation? What is the available output?

•	Geographic scale and scope—Is the analysis attempting to address coastal vulnerability at a
  national scale or at a specific study site?

•	Resolution of available information—What data are already available or could be collected
  for the analysis? This data can range from meteo-oceanographic data (for example, wind-
  waves) to human assets values (for example, human population densities).

•	Technical resources—What expertise and computing resources are available to set up and
  run the models or apply the tools?

Although most approaches for estimating and valuing coastal protection services require
technical expertise, many of the general ecosystem service and coastal protection tools are
becoming more accessible and easier to use. Given that the expertise is available to build them,
numerous coastal engineering models and approaches can address the role of natural habitats
in ecosystem services at a finer resolution. Many of the coastal engineering approaches reviewed
here can readily address the role of coastal marine habitats in erosion and flood reduction, as
well as to design restoration projects that maximize these benefits. However, transferring flood
and erosion reduction into expected damage relationships needs to factor in the consequences
on assets and human populations. The information, guidance, and processes described in this
chapter can facilitate the inclusion of habitats in national accounts.

Tools were evaluated on the following characteristics:

•	Ease of use—Modeling tools are technically advanced and have the ability to run custom
  analyses. They generally require some amount of technical expertise or training; however, as
  these tools become increasingly common, some are being developed with a nontechnical user
  in mind. The ease of use category includes the following: (i) the user-friendliness of the tool’s
  interface; (ii) the ability for the public to access the tool’s source code and modify its design, if
  desired (that is, is it open source?); (iii) whether the tool requires highly technical programming
  skills to get started; (iv) whether the tool is well-documented and explained in a user manual,
  peer-reviewed papers, or other publications (this can provide instructions as well as credibility
  to the tool); and (v) if the tool is either web-based or only requires one software application to
  run the model from start to finish.

•	Input—This includes the following: (i) if the model provides general asset data, such as
  population densities; (ii) the ability of the user to model different scenarios, such as different

5| Approaches for Valuing Coastal Protection Services in a
Natural Capital Accounting Framework
Jim Sanchirico,e,f Juha Siikamaki,f Glenn-Marie Lange,g and Anne Riddlee

5.1| Summary
Previous chapters have discussed the biophysical aspects of coastal protection, but a full
accounting for these services and the assets providing them requires estimating the economic
value as well. The economics profession has developed a large suite of tools for valuing
ecosystem services that are not typically traded in markets and, thus, do not have readily
observable prices. This section opens with a discussion of the different types of ecosystem
services and methods developed to estimate their values with special attention to those tools
used to value the protective services of coral reefs and mangroves. This guidance note aims to
explore how these values might be linked to national economic accounts. This is important,
because national accounts, providing such indicators as GDP, are the primary way that national
economic performance is monitored and a major input into policy analysis. The System of
Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA; European Commission et al. 2012) is a satellite
account to the System of National Accounts (SNA; European Commission et al. 2008) developed
to better represent the role of natural capital in the economy. By incorporating natural capital
explicitly in the SEEA, linked to national economic accounts, the economic importance of natural
capital can be more readily recognized by mainstream economists and mainstreamed into
decision making. The chapter concludes with recommendations on an approach to valuation for
coastal protection services in the SEEA framework, aligned with the SNA.

The existing literature on the value of coastal protective services is limited both by the number of
studies and their geographic coverage. Most valuation studies come from South East Asia, but
other world regions where mangroves and coral reefs are prevalent are also represented in the
literature. The most commonly used valuation method is the replacement cost method for
assessing the comparative value of the protection provided by mangroves and coral reefs (for
example, as compared to the cost of building alternative protection, such as sea walls). However,
this approach provides valid estimates of economic value only under highly restrictive criteria
and its prevalence in the economic literature is largely because of the ease of application.

For coastal protection services, production function methods, especially the EDF approach,
provide more valid estimates of economic value and are also aligned with concepts of the SEEA
and SNA. The EDF approach builds from engineering and insurance-based models for estimating
the property protection value (or avoided damages) of coastal structures (see Section 4).

The effort to extend the national accounts to include natural capital resulted in the adoption by
the UN Statistical Commission of the System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Central
Framework (SEEA-CF) as an international statistical standard in 2012, which nearly all countries
have implemented to measure economic performance. The SEEA-CF is linked to the SNA by
common concepts, methods and classifications; it extends the SNA to include stock and flow
accounts for land, material resources, energy, emission of pollutants and monetary accounts for
environmentally related taxes, and subsidies, as well as revised macroeconomic aggregates and

indicators, such as GDP. In this way, the SEEA-CF includes many of what the Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment (2005) called the provisioning services of ecosystems, although it does
not use that term directly. But the SEEA-CF does not address the regulating ecosystem services.
The SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (UN et al., 2013) was developed to take a broader
approach to ecosystem accounting and presents the best practice in ecosystem accounting so
far, but this is a very new field, and the handbook is intended as a guide for experimentation and
learning, rather than an agreed accounting framework.

While there has been important progress in developing and implementing accounting systems,
considerable challenges remain. Many regulating services have value because they are inputs to
economic production, but without a market price, these inputs are not identified in the national
accounts and their value attributed to the using sector. For example, pollination services provided
from a forest or wetland is captured in the value of agricultural output in the national accounts.
Ecosystem accounts are intended to make explicit the contribution of this nonmarket service in
order to improve economic management. Coastal protection is also a type of nonmarket
intermediate service that contributes to the value of infrastructure, housing and other assets, and
in a well-functioning property market, the price of these assets would reflect the protection service.
But it is not clear whether this value is currently comprehensively included in the market price of
housing and other assets; often this data may be difficult to obtain in developing countries.

Overall, there is a deep understanding of the biophysical features of protective services, but the
level of experience and knowledge on the economic valuation of protective services of mangroves
and coral reefs is thin. The development and greater use of biophysical models to assess the role of
mangroves and coral reefs in preventing flooding and erosion, described in earlier chapters, could
provide a more systematic and consistent method to assess benefits of protective services;
additional research on estimating the magnitude of economic benefits associated with protective
services is warranted to guide decision makers about where to prioritize investments in natural
assets, either on their own or in combination with built infrastructure.

5.2| Introduction
During the past 15 years, there has been growing interest in the quantification of the economic
values associated with ecosystem services (for example, Daily 1997; Heal 2000; Bockstael et al.
2000). The basis for this interest stems from two distinct but related areas of inquiry. First, there
is the concern that by not valuing these resources explicitly, decision makers are implicitly
assigning a value of zero on them in project level assessments (Bateman et al. 2013; Sanchirico
and Springborn 2011). The implication of a zero value in a cost-benefit analysis, for example, is
that project level activities that degrade ecosystem functions are favored over those that
maintain or restore the functions that produce the ecosystem services (for example, Bateman et
al. 2013). Second, there is a small, but growing, body of literature on how to incorporate
ecosystem services into national accounts based on the SEEA-EEA and other approaches (for
example, Edens and Hein 2013). The main motivation is similar to those for the project level
analysis. That is, by including ecosystem services, national accounts will better illustrate the role
that ecosystem assets and services play in the economic activity of a country, and will provide a
tool for incorporating natural capital in development planning.

This chapter discusses the available methods to value the coastal protective services provided by
coral reefs and mangroves. It then considers how well these approaches align with the SNA and
SEEA framework that has been developed to incorporate ecosystems, including the assets (for
example, forests), and the flows from those assets (for example, timber). One important
distinction between valuation exercises for projects and valuation for national accounting is that




                                                 111

the latter requires that the values be as close to exchange values as possible (values expressed
through transactions or potential transactions), while the former is focused on measuring the
welfare gains of a particular project (that is, willingness to pay, consumer surplus). A more
detailed discussion of valuation concepts in national accounts and nonmarket services can be
found in Nordhaus (2006), Obst et al. (2015), and World Bank (forthcoming 2016).

 The Ecosystem Services Valuation section provides background on the methods to value
 different types of ecosystem services and reviews the existing valuation literature. The section
“Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital Accounting” provides background on the SEEA, with
 particular focus on the SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA) and on the
 challenges of incorporating coastal protection services into the SEEA-EEA framework. Finally,
 there is a discussion of the findings and recommendations for incorporating the value of
 ecosystem assets and services into SEEA accounting framework.

5.3| Ecosystem Services Valuation
This section briefly defines the concept of ecosystem services, discusses economic values
associated with ecosystem services, reviews different approaches for estimating the value of
ecosystem services, and discusses applications for measuring coastal protection benefits from
reefs and wetlands.

Ecosystem services and their value
Ecosystem services fall into four categories: provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Provisioning services are embodied in the products
that are directly consumed, such as the fish produced by a fishery or a crop from agricultural
land. These services are most often traded in markets. Supporting services are underlying
ecosystem processes, such as soil formation and oxygen production, which support the
functioning of other ecosystem services. Regulating services are ecosystem functions that
control biophysical cycles and levels, such as nutrient cycling, water filtration, or flood frequency
and height (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Coastal protection from mangroves and
coral reefs, through erosion reduction or flood mitigation, is a regulating service, while the fish
production from coral reef and mangrove habitats is a provisioning service. Finally, cultural
services are the intangible benefits ecosystems provide to people through emotional enjoyment,
such as aesthetic experiences and recreation.

For the purpose of valuation, a distinction is made between the provision of services and the
benefits humans derive from the service. Only those services that benefit humans are considered
to have economic value. Values associated with ecosystem services are often categorized by
economists as “use or nonuse,” “direct or indirect,” and “market and nonmarket.” Use values
encompass goods and services that can be tangibly used either directly or indirectly (EPA 2008).
Goods or services used directly—for example, fish harvested from a mangrove—are a direct-use
good. Indirect uses comprise goods and services that are not used directly, but still provide use-
benefits of economic value (EPA 2008). For example, flood control and wave energy attenuation
from mangroves and coral reefs are an indirect-use value as they contribute a valuable input into
the other economic goods and services, such as housing. Typically, indirect services do not have
market prices, but the housing market may provide useful information to examine the values
associated with such services, as explained below in the discussion of ecosystem service valuation
methods. Nonuse values comprise ecological goods and services that are not physically used but
still hold economic value (EPA 2008). Existence values, wherein individuals value the knowledge
that certain ecosystems exist and will continue to exist, are examples of nonuse values.




                                                 112
                                     www.wavespartnership.org



Ecosystems often simultaneously contribute toward many types of services and values (see
Cesar and Chong [2004] and Farber et al. [2002]). For example, the same tidal marsh may
provide the direct-use values of oyster production for fishers and recreation opportunities for
birders, the indirect-use value of erosion regulation for adjacent communities, and the existence
value individuals place on the bay ecosystem.

Valuation methods for mangrove and coral reef ecosystem services
This section gives a brief description of the methods to value ecosystem services (see Appendix
5.1 for a list of the methods). Discussing the technical issues associated with each method is
beyond the scope of this report. Interested readers should consult Freeman (2003) and Holland
et al. (2010). The section then discusses results of an extensive literature review on the estimates
and methods used in prior research.

Market valuation
Most provisioning ecosystem services are often exchanged in markets and market prices are
used to value them. Market information can also be used to measure goods and services for
which a market price is not directly observable. For example, the SNA includes the value of
goods that are not exchanged in markets, but potentially could be, such as fish harvested by a
household for its own consumption. Typically, the fish used for own consumption is valued at the
price of similar fish exchanged in markets.

However, many ecosystem services are not exchanged in markets so they lack the information,
such as prices, to assist valuation. Nonetheless, there are methods for valuation of nonmarket
goods. They are typically divided into revealed preference methods, where the value of the
ecosystem service is revealed through the behavior of economic actors, or stated preference
methods, where the value is directly elicited by statements made by individuals in a hypothetical
setting. This section reviews the primary methods that are relevant to valuing coastal protection.
Other valuation techniques that are not relevant will not be reviewed here. These include, for
example, the travel cost method, which is mainly used to estimate recreation services.

Revealed preference methods for coastal protection
Hedonic price studies can be used to estimate indirect use values for ecosystem services that
affect the prices of marketed goods. The hedonic method rests on the notion that the price of a
marketed good reflects all of the attributes of the good (Freeman 2003). Most typically, it is
applied to property values, where variations in price reflect the characteristics of the house (for
example, number of bedrooms or bathrooms) and also the value of local public goods. The local
public goods include quality of the schools, safety (police and fire), public infrastructure (roads),
and environmental amenities (such as views, proximity to aesthetically desirable ecosystems,
such as waterways, or mature vegetation) or environmental quality (such as air and water
pollution) (Freeman 2003).

To measure how much individuals value a single environmental attribute, such as distance to the
coast, one controls for all other attributes of the property’s price. The remaining systematic
variation in relation to distance to the coast reflects the individuals’ value for coastal proximity of
the property. The range of ecosystem services that can be measured with this technique is
limited to benefits related to housing prices (and therefore, to specific locations), and to those
ecosystem services wherein individuals perceive the benefit and link it to the property they buy
(Landrey 2011). In one study, Landrey, Keeler, and Kriesel (2003) find that a one meter increase in
beach width adds $233 to property values (at the mean of their data), where beach width




                                                  113
                              Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



increases the recreational experience and yields improved protection from coastal storms (see
also studies by Pompe [2008] and Pompe and Rinehard [1995]). In principle, hedonic analysis
can be used to value coastal protection services should those services shelter property that is
subject to transactions. A key challenge is to carefully control for other aspects of the property’s
value in order to isolate the value of the protective service. This approach may be difficult to
implement in developing countries, because it relies on extensive data on either actual market
transactions or appraised values, which are often not available.

Averting behavior methods use costs incurred by individuals attempting to avoid or mitigate the
effects of poor environmental quality. For example, consumers may respond to poor quality tap
water by buying bottled water or installing filters, incurring additional costs. The value for
improving the tap water quality can then be imputed from the consumers’ expenditures (Abdalla
et al. 1992). In terms of coastal protection, a homeowner paying to raise the foundation of a house
is a form of averting behavior with the goal to avoid the costs of damage from flooding events.

The replacement cost method estimates the cost of providing a service of interest should the
ecosystem no longer function properly or no longer exist. Typically, it involves estimating the
cost of a seawall or other engineering structure to replace coastal protection provided by
mangroves. This approach has been widely used for the valuation of coastal protection services,
because there has been extensive experience with engineering structures so that the costs are
well known, making implementation of this approach relatively easy. However, replacement cost
is unlikely to coincide with the marginal willingness to pay for this service, making it less useful for
accounting purposes. Replacement cost methods are only valid measures of the economic value
of the service under rather stringent criteria: (i) if the same service is supplied by the ecosystem
and the alternative provider; (ii) if the replacement alternative is the least cost replacement
option, and (iii) if the replacement alternative would actually be implemented, if unavailable from
the ecosystem (Boyer 2004; US EPA 2009). Replacement cost methods should also only be
used to measure one service at a time, which is consistent with valuing flood and storm surge
protection.

Vincent (2015) has suggested that replacement cost could be used in combination with
contingent valuation (discussed below) in which contingent valuation is used to estimate
willingness to pay for the service. If the willingness to pay is at least as great as the cost-based
measure, then replacement cost can be used, meeting the criteria cited above.

More generally, coastal protective services are potentially substitutable with engineering
solutions, such as seawalls or breakwaters, depending on the scale of the project under
consideration. For example, if the decision is whether to clear a hectare of mangroves, then it is
likely that a breakwater at that scale (or at least the scale necessary to provide the same level of
protection) is technologically feasible. If the scale is tens or hundreds of hectares of mangroves
(for example, at the scale of a country’s stock), then it is not technologically feasible to employ an
equivalent technology. In this case, replacement cost is not an appropriate method of valuation.
Thus, depending on the analysis and questions asked in the valuation exercise, it is possible that
the replacement costs are a viable measure of the economic value of coastal protective services.

In situations where payments for ecosystem services (PES) markets exist in a competitive form,
these prices directly reflect market transactions and are also potentially applicable for the
service in question (UN et al. 2014). Other examples of ecosystem service exchange values
include access permits, tourism expenditures, land value, insurance premiums, and remediation
costs (ABS 2015). However, in the majority of cases, the payments are a poor proxy for the
economic value of ecosystem services provided. The payments are most often fixed payments,




                                                  114

not set in competitive markets and thus unlikely to reflect the actual value of the service. After
many years of experience with PES, there is increasing interest in assessing the extent to which
the payments reflect the actual value. As more work is done on this subject, it will become clearer
when PES is a reasonable proxy for value.

Stated preference methods
Personal preferences for nature and ecosystems are often based on more than their worth in use.
Such nonuse values are difficult to measure, because they are not captured in market
transactions or other observable actions, such as recreation site choice. This problem has given
rise to the development of a variety of nonmarket valuation methods that use surveys to elicit
preferences for public goods. Because these methods are generally based on eliciting “stated”
rather than “revealed” preferences, they are broadly categorized as stated preference
(SP) methods (Krupnick and Siikamäki 2007).

SP methods use surveys designed to elicit respondents’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for
improvements or protections to a specified environmental resource, such as the extent and
quality of habitat, species protected, or the quality of air or water resources. Contingent
valuation and choice experiment are the two primary methods for SP analysis. In a typical
contingent valuation survey, each respondent is asked, often using a voting question, to approve
or disapprove the proposed environmental scenario given its monetary cost. Researchers vary
the program costs across different survey respondents and use their choices to estimate how
much people are willing to pay for different scenarios to improve the environment (Mitchell and
Carson 1989; Freeman 2003; Krupnick and Siikamäki 2007).

In a choice experiment, respondents identify their preferences among one or more programs or
alternative management strategies specifically altering different attributes of the program, such
as its different environmental outcomes and monetary cost. By varying the levels of these
attributes (including cost) across different scenarios and by examining respondents’ choices, it is
possible to estimate how much people are willing to pay for the different attributes of the
program, as well as the entire program (Freeman 2003).

These approaches have been used most often to estimate such nonuse values as recreational
services and wildlife preservation, and have also been used to estimate public willingness to pay
for new public drinking water sources (Johnston 2006). This approach has not been used to
value coastal protection services.

Because SP methods do not use information revealed by actual choices, their validity in
estimating the true WTP is challenged (Murphy et al. 2005). More problematic, stated
preference methods include consumer surplus so the values produced are not consistent with
the exchange value concept of the SNA and cannot be used in the SEEA/EEA directly. It is
possible to derive an estimated exchange value from stated preference studies by tracing a
demand schedule that is combined with an estimation of a supply curve (Edens and Hein 2013;
UN et al. 2014). Undertaking such an exercise can be done using the simulated exchange method
as discussed in Siikamaki and Layton (2005) and Oviedo et al. (2010).

Production function methods and the Expected Damage Function
Production function (or bioeconomic) models are commonly used to measure services that
provide indirect input to something that society values, such as the water supply and sediment
control services of forests to hydroelectricity. Production functions describe the manner in which
an output is related to the quantity and nature of inputs used to create it. An ecosystem’s




                                                115
                             Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions



structure, such as size, vegetation, boundaries, and its functional aspects, such as ability to
absorb floodwater or remove contaminants from surface water, are biophysical contributors—as
inputs—to the services the habitat generates. These biophysical attributes for estimating coastal
protection services for mangroves and reefs are well known and the previous chapters have
described a production function approach to measuring coastal protection.

The Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach presumes that the value of an asset that
reduces the severity or probability of economic damage, such as coastal mangroves or coral
reefs, can be measured by the reduction in the expected damage. This method is an extension to
production function methods, applicable for valuing regulating services, which by definition,
protect nearby economic activities from possible damages (Barbier 2007). The engineering and
insurance sectors have used EDF as a general approach to assess the cost effectiveness of
alternatives for flood and erosion risk reduction (see Chapter 4 for further description of the EDF
approach, and the data required and available to measure it).

To illustrate how EDF yields economic measures of value, consider, for example, a coastal
community where homes, businesses, and public infrastructure are threatened by damage from
periodic storms. If the expected incidence of storm damage rises, say from the loss of coastal
mangroves, then households subject to the risks require greater income to reach the same level
of wellbeing they had prior to the change in storm incidence. The presence of coastal wetlands
mitigates the expected incidence of storm damage and thus, provides a benefit similar to an
increase in income. Conversely, a loss in wetland area would increase expected storm damages
and be equivalent to a loss of income. This change in income, also known as compensating
surplus, provides the theoretical rigor to EDF as a measure of economic value.

A limitation of the EDF approach is that it values expected damages, rather than people’s valuation
of the risk. That is, the EDF approach assumes that people are indifferent to risk. However, people
tend to be risk averse and prefer certainty over riskiness. For example, coastal households likely
want to not just experience fewer damages from storms, but also a smaller variances in expected
storm damages (that is, they would rather storms be not only small, but also consistent in the
damages caused each time). This suggests there should also be a “risk premium” in addition to the
storm protection value, which measures how much the ecosystem reduces the variance in
expected damage from storm events (Barbier 2007; Hirshleifer and Riley 1992).

Implementing valuation methods and benefit transfer
The data required for directly implementing the valuation techniques were described above. In
some cases, an alternative approach to directly implementing these techniques is used, called
benefit transfer. The basic principle of the benefit transfer method is to value ecosystem services
in one location by drawing from information on their value in another location. The method,
therefore, involves a geographic transfer of valuation results. There are three main approaches to
benefit transfer: value transfers; benefit function transfers; and meta-regression transfers. A
value transfer directly applies an estimate of the value of an ecosystem service to another. A
benefit function transfer takes an estimated function, which describes how the ecosystem
service is related to the value estimated, and applies it from its original context to another. The
most comprehensive method is a meta-regression analysis, which uses all relevant existing
studies and estimates a function to predict the value of ecosystem services as a product of site
characteristics, size, and attributes of the affected human population.

A typical challenge with this method is that the original information imperfectly or poorly
matches the biophysical and socioeconomic conditions in the target area of the transfer. The




                                                116
                                    www.wavespartnership.org



value of ecosystem services depends on the biophysical, economic, and institutional context.
Furthermore, ecosystems are interdependent: the value of an ecosystem service likely
depends on the existence or location of other ecosystem components. Therefore, assuming
that the valuation results from one ecosystem will be directly applicable to another can be
problematic.

For valuing protective services, location-dependent drivers of the value are likely considerable,
so any attempt to use a benefit transfer approach should incorporate them. For example, the
value of protective services will necessarily depend on the value of local property, subject to the
risk of coastal flooding, as well as the likelihood of storms and flooding in the local setting.

Valuation literature on coastal protective services
This section reviews and discusses current literature on the economic valuation of ecosystems
services from mangroves and coral reefs for coastal protective services (for example, meta-
analysis of values for coral reefs [Brander et al. 2007] and for mangroves [Brander et al.
2012]). A literature review was done to examine coastal protection and many other ecosystem
services. There were 175 studies and 477 associated value estimates addressing different
ecosystem services from corals and mangroves. About 52 percent (248) of the value
estimates address coral reefs. Mangroves are the subject of valuation in 45 percent (214) of
estimates. A small minority (3 percent) of value estimates address multiple ecosystems.

Value estimates in the database represent a wide range of different types of ecosystem services.
Recreation is the ecosystem service addressed by the largest number of value estimates, with
about 29 percent (129) of the value estimates (Ghermandi and Nunes 2013). The second and
third largest ecosystem services types are fisheries (74 estimates; 16 percent of all value
estimates) and the provision of raw materials (51 estimates; 11 of all value estimates).

Studies to value ecological protective services are the fourth most common in the database. For
example, 34 value estimates address protection from flooding. Erosion is addressed by seven
estimates and the valuation of coastal protection specifically is the purpose of five estimates.
Altogether 46 value estimates are associated with protective services.

Of the 46 value estimates for protective services, most were in Southeast Asia (18 estimates),
followed by the Caribbean and South Asia (Figure 5.1). Therefore, although many regions are
represented in the data, the amount of information per region is limited. An implication of the
spatial distribution is that a researcher conducting a benefits transfer would need to consider the
applicability of estimates, for example, from Southeast Asia for the Caribbean.

Appendix 5.2 summarizes the studies that focus on coastal protection, including
information on the services valued, the unit of the valuation (endpoint), method of
estimating value, and the method used to estimate physical damages. About one third of
the value studies use the replacement cost method (Figure 5.2 and Appendix 5.2). Other
key valuation methods include the avoided cost method (11 estimates) and direct market
pricing (eight estimates). The endpoints measured in each study vary but are often in
dollars per distance squared measured annually. However, there are studies that convert
the expected annual loss into a net present value over a period of time by discounting the
loss out into the future (Spurgeon 2003).

The distance measure varies where some authors consider the elevation within which the
flooding will occur, while others use a simple cut-off of distance from the coast without regard for
elevation. The decision on how to determine the extent of the damages to consider and value is

context specific (see Chapter 4), but authors often use rules of thumb, flat rates (that is, 5 percent
of all property value will be lost), or some combination of the two. Some studies do not measure
damages, but consider the value of coastal property. Many studies use cost-based methods but
do not discuss whether the conditions for using the methods are met in the current context.

While the endpoints are generally at a fine spatial resolution, the estimated values do not
consider interactions across the impacted domains. For example, the construction material
(such as concrete) and height of buildings (one versus two story) will influence the expected
damages. Other factors that are often omitted include the orientation of the town relative to the
shape of the coast and the main channel of storm surge. Furthermore, values are often
somewhat crudely downscaled from larger scale aggregate value, such as the estimated value of
property in a broader region—dividing the aggregate value by the size of the target area to

develop a finer scale estimate, for example (see column labeled “conversion” in Appendix 5.2).
The use of aggregate values is a common issue in the ecological valuation literature.

In the natural resource economics literature, the EDF approach was first applied to the economic
valuation of coastal protection services provided by coastal wetlands in Farber (1987). More
recently, Barbier (2007, 2014) has further developed the EDF approach for coastal protection
services and compared it to replacement cost methods. Using data from Thailand and their
estimated costs of breakwater construction ($1,011 per meter of coastline), he estimated the
replacement cost of a similar amount of mangroves to be $13.48 per square hectare. Given the
rates of mangrove loss in Thailand, he estimated the net present value of welfare loss over a
20-year period at $23 to $28 million. In contrast, using the EDF approach and considering past
storm damages in Thailand, he estimated the net present welfare loss in storm protection was
$3.1 to $3.7 million. The difference between the replacement cost approach and EDF was nearly
an order of magnitude. Barbier (2007) argues that relative to the replacement cost method, the
EDF approach provides a more robust measure of the value of coastal protective services,
especially for large-scale assessments. This application of the EDF approach did have limitations
in that the effectiveness of mangroves in reducing storm damage was inferred from past events.

More recently, Barbier (2014, 2015) carried out studies applying the EDF approach to coastal
protection services in the Gulf of Mexico, following Hurricane Katrina. Coastal marshes, rather
than mangroves or coral reefs, provide ecological protection in this study area, but the
application of the EDF approach to coastal protection is the same.

In sum, there exists a large suite of tested approaches for ecosystem service valuation. Each
method is suited for some ecosystem services and each requires different types of data and data
collection methods, from personal surveys to property prices and attributes, and beyond. For
coastal protection services, production function methods, especially the EDF approach, are
especially informative and yield estimates of value for decision makers. Replacement cost
methods have been most widely used, largely because of the availability of data, but are most
applicable for small-scale project level estimates of value of coastal protective services, and only
then, if the conditions for their use are met. As Barbier’s study demonstrates, replacement cost
estimates can be far greater than the EDF approach. Further investigation is needed to
determine whether hedonic approaches based on property prices can be used. Some of the key
data for using any of these approaches to estimate coastal protection services include property
value, past damages, and a measure of the expected damages.

Overall, the level of empirical knowledge on the value of protective services of mangroves and
coral reefs is thin, especially relative to the understanding of the biophysical features of
protective services. While the current coastal engineering models are sophisticated, the state of
literature on the ecological valuation of protective services needs more rigor and applications in
different settings. More work remains to be done in this area before standardized protocols are
available for valuation. Fortunately the tools and knowledge from the engineering and insurance
sectors can be rapidly adapted to help.

5.4| Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital Accounting
The System of National Accounts (SNA) is the most widely used set of information to monitor
economic performance through such indicators as GDP and to carry out economic analysis for
policy and planning. It has long been criticized for its incomplete accounting for natural
resources and environmental services (Mäler 1991). The SNA does not account for the depletion
of natural resources (minerals, oil, forests, and fisheries) in the production accounts and many




                                                119

ecosystem services more broadly. These resources are implicitly valued at zero when they are
not included in national accounts (Dasgupta 2009). In response, the international community
embarked on a process to develop a framework to expand the SNA for environmental accounts
to fill this gap. A two-decade effort of conceptual and applied work to test out different
approaches culminated in the System of Environmental Economic Accounting 2012-Central
Framework (SEEA-CF), which the UN Statistical Commission adopted in 2012 as an international
standard, similar to the SNA. The SEEA-CF is a satellite account to the SNA, meaning that it is
closely aligned to the SNA through the use of common concepts, definitions, measurements,
and classifications, but not fully integrated into the SNA accounts so that it does not change the
fundamental SNA indicators and aggregates. The SEEA-CF includes asset and flow accounts,
physical and monetary, for natural resources, energy, pollutants, land, environmentally related
monetary transactions (taxes and subsidies), and macroeconomic aggregates and indicators.

The SEEA-CF is designed in a modular manner so that countries can implement the components
that are most relevant to them, for example, water supply, and use tables or mineral asset
accounts, but do not have to implement that entire set of accounts. The SEEA-CF has now been
adopted for regular production by more than 30 countries, and other countries produce accounts
on an occasional basis. While international agreement has been reached on SEEA methodology
to account for individual natural resources, energy, and emissions, which together with the SNA
cover most of the provisioning services and recreation, there has been growing interest in more
comprehensive accounting for ecosystems, including the regulating services that are not covered
in the SEEA-CF. A process was launched in 2006 to tackle the much more complex topic of
ecosystem accounting. In 2014, the UN Statistical Commission accepted the SEEA-Experimental
Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA, UN et al. 2014) as a best practice manual.

The SEEA-EEA provides general information on what has been considered so far and is a basis
for further experimentation by practitioners in the long process to develop a statistical standard.
There are a number of countries and agencies currently implementing ecosystem accounting.
Canada is producing accounts for several ecosystems. Australia has produced accounts for the
Great Barrier Reef (ABS 2015). The Netherlands is planning national coverage based on a pilot
study of Limburg province (Edens et al. 2015). The United Kingdom has produced forest
ecosystem accounts (Khan et al. 2013). Under the World Bank’s WAVES program, the Philippines
has constructed ecosystem accounts for two pilot sites, the Laguna Bay Basin (World Bank
2015a) and southern Palawan (World Bank 2015b) and several other countries are beginning
work (Colombia, Guatemala, and Rwanda). The UN Statistics Division has launched a series of
training workshops on the EEA for several countries, including Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and
Vietnam. Academic studies have been carried out: for example, in Norway (Schroter et al. 2014);
Indonesia (Sumarga and Hein 2014); and Peru (Conservation International 2015). Others have
experimented with incorporating ecosystem services in national accounts, notably Barbier
(2015) for Thailand, but this section focuses on the work that follows the SEEA-EEA framework.

Several points from country experiences are worth noting. First, most case studies implemented
only physical ecosystem accounts with valuation limited to one or two services, and no attempt
to value the entire asset. Ecosystem accounting has often focused on a few ecosystem services
of greatest importance, rather than trying to cover all ecosystem services. There is a great
advantage to constructing ecosystem accounts where there are comprehensive national
statistics on land ownership that can be spatially aligned with an ecosystem, for example,
catchment regions in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom. Among the
WAVES pilot developing countries, only Rwanda has similar information, where every parcel of
land is georeferenced in a national database.

5.5| The SEEA-Experimental Ecosystem Accounting

Components of EEA Accounts
The SEEA-EEA is designed to measure and value ecosystem assets and the services they
provide. There is a focus on the challenge of the nonmarket ecosystem services that are invisible
or “missing” from the SNA, since most of the market services—largely the provisioning and
recreational services—are already captured in the SNA and do not need special treatment. It
follows the same structure as the SEEA-CF and SNA, in that it encompasses biophysical
accounting for physical flows and assets, and monetary accounts for both the flows and assets
(for more detailed discussion of ecosystem accounts described in this section see UN et al. 2014).

Biophysical accounting in the SEEA-EEA
Physical asset accounts measure the biophysical stocks, such as the area extent of mangroves or
coral reefs, producing ecosystem services at a specified point in time (UN ET AL. 2014).
Ecosystem assets in the EEA are an ecosystem on the landscape: an explicit, spatially
determined area containing biotic and abiotic components that function as a unit. In the EEA,
ecosystem assets are measured by their extent and condition, and the expected flows of the full
basket of “final” ecosystem services in the future.

The ecosystem asset could be the extent of a mangrove forest in a jurisdiction, as noted above. In
terms of the basket of services, mangroves provide nursery habitat for important fish and
crustaceans, carbon storage, flood protection, and wood products.

Spatial Units of Flows and Assets30
The first building block of an ecosystem account is land and one of the key considerations in
measuring the biophysical accounts is the spatial unit of analysis. EEA is spatially explicit and
uses three types of spatial units for ecosystem flow and asset accounts: Basic Spatial Units
(BSU), Land Cover/Ecosystem Functional Units (LCEU), and Ecosystem Accounting Units (EAU).

BSUs are small spatial areas, typically a one-kilometer-squared grid, with relevant but basic
information about the land they contain. These are aggregated into LCEUs. LCEUs are relatively
homogeneous ecosystems whose processes are more closely linked internally than externally.
For example, the nutrient cycles and energy flow around a coral reef more often flow back into
the reef ecosystem than out into the shore or the open ocean. While the EEA suggests the use of
the FAO Land Cover Classification System,31 adopter countries are free to create their own
organizing principles for LCEUs. For example, Australia uses their native National Vegetation
Information System.32


30	 On the basis of a workshop on the SEEA-EEA held in April 2015, hosted by the UN Statistics Division, some of
the terminology will be revised in a forthcoming technical note.
31	 The FAO Land Cover Classification System based on universally applicable diagnostic criteria, such as

whether an area is primarily vegetated, aquatic, and so forth, can be used to create a dichotomous, hierarchical
classification system rather than a pre-defined set of classes. An example class that could emerge from the
system is “multi-layered broadleaved deciduous forest.” For more information see http://www.fao.org/
docrep/003/x0596e/x0596e01e.htm.
32	 The Australian experimental ecosystem account for the state of Victoria is compiled at the LCEU level, using

the Major Vegetation Groups classification of the Australian National Vegetation Information System (FVIS;
DSE 2013). Measurements of extent used in the asset account also came from existing extent statistics created
by the FVIS, while condition measurements (DSE 2013) came from the ABS Experimental Land Accounts. The
accounts are then aggregated up to the EAU level by grouping spatially within Catchment Management

LCEUs can be further aggregated up into EAUs (see Figure 5.3). Creating EAUs takes into
account administrative boundaries, natural features, and other characteristics, which create a
cohesive unit of management interest, such as a river basin or a coral reef. Measurement can be
made directly at each level, or BSUs may be aggregated into LCEUs and those into EAUs (and
they may be similarly disaggregated in the same order). When referring to ecosystem services,
guidance documents propose starting the recording and measurement at the scale of an LCEU
for two reasons. First, BSUs that are at a fine scale have significant data requirements. Second,
LCEUs are the smallest unit that can be used to represent holistic ecosystems, which is the scale
that asset accounts are created.

In the case of mangroves and reefs, LCEUs and BSUs may be defined based on existing data and
classifications. The LCEU for mangroves likely does not require further subdividing by mangrove
type (or at least at present there is not a consistent habitat subclassification approach). Coral
reefs can be subdivided into at least four reef types (barrier, fringing, patch, or shelf) based on
existing reef classifications and the spatial data (for example, http://data.unep-wcmc.org/
datasets/1).

To the extent that a further EAU is needed, this should likely parallel other national accounting
units, such as census tracts, management areas, or provinces. Given the spatial resolutions of
existing mangrove, reef and wave data, one square kilometer units are an acceptable BSU for
these habitats. Reguero et al. (in review) propose another method for delineating coastal
ecosystems by using one-kilometer-wide bands that run perpendicular to the shore, which has
the benefit of tying the habitats (LCEUs) to the shoreline, where they can be more easily
summed in to typical terrestrial administrative units (that is, EAUs). Regardless of the method or
unit used, practitioners should take care in aggregating BSUs to ensure differing sizes do not
create difficulties in comparing final values.



Authority (CMA), which cover the ten catchments within the state (DSE 2013). The CMAs provide the link
between the EAU and socioeconomic data for valuation, since the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports land
valuation data to the catchment level, allowing the EAUs to be directly overlaid with these data (DSE 2013).

In one approach to develop a monetary account of the biophysical flows and stocks (see
discussion below), correspondence to economic units can be made when spatial units are
delineated, such as through spatial overlay with land ownership or land use in each physical
accounting unit. The correspondence is likely most precise at the BSU level. Using coarser scales
(more aggregate spatial scales) may require additional assumptions. In one proposed approach,
ecosystem services, whose benefits accrue to the public rather than to an individual institution,
are recorded in the accounts to the “ecosystem” actor. Therefore, for these services, the
economic correspondence is made when the LCEU is delineated.

Monetary accounting and aggregation of multiple ecosystem services
Because the SNA is based upon the concept of exchange value,33 it is theoretically possible,
when exchange values of ecosystem services have been estimated, to aggregate the values of all
services provided by an ecosystems, much like aggregating the value of multiple products
produced by a single factory. For example, to get the total value of ecosystem services in an EAU,
sum each LCEU within the EAU and aggregate all the LCEUs to create a value for the entire
accounting area. Another possible method would be to aggregate values by LCEU for the
accounting area across all habitat types. For example, one could sum the value from all
mangroves, coral reefs, forests, urban areas, and so forth in the EAU.

While the use of exchange values across the different habitat types hypothetically allows for the
development of a single value, there are issues associated with combining use of other values or
mixed values, where the basis for valuation may differ. Although it is simple in concept, this
approach assumes that all services are likely to be independent and that the value added of
interrelated services is netted out, that is, the total contribution of each individual service is
counted exactly once (UN et al. 2014). Double counting is probable if dependencies between
services are not considered. Resolution of the issue will require careful and thorough modeling of
ecosystems.

Ecosystem asset valuation
In the absence of markets for assets, it is common to estimate the value of any asset as the
present value of the stream of benefits the asset is expected to produce over its lifetime. This
approach, for example, is described for valuing subsoil assets in the SNA and the SEEA. In
principle, the ecosystem asset account can, be valued using the net present value (NPV) of all
the expected future ecosystem service flows (whole basket of services) from the asset.34 This
concept is relatively straightforward for land, where there is a well-developed property market
and for some natural resource assets, such as minerals and energy, for which an expected
extraction path and prices are estimated.35 It is less simple for ecosystems that provide a wide
range of nonmarket, as well as market services. For example, for a single mangrove delineated as
an LCEU that is expected to provide shrimp, fuel wood, flood protection, and recreation services
for 50 years, the asset value of the LCEU is the present value of the aggregated exchange value
of all of these services for 50 years. Over time, annual changes in the value of the asset account,
based on new annual assessments of the flow of services, would then indicate whether the value
of natural capital is increasing or decreasing over time. But this is an area where there are

paper by the World Bank (2016).

sheets and the dynamics are not as complex as for ecosystems.

currently no clear guidelines and a great deal of discussion. The World Bank WAVES Program is
further developing this work (World Bank forthcoming 2016).

The valuation of an ecosystem asset as the sum of the future stream of benefits requires a
number of assumptions about the flow of future services and their value, which can be quite
challenging. Many factors may affect the flow of services (from management of an ecosystem to
exogenous factors, such as climate change) and their value. The London Group36 is also
considering another approach based on estimating ecosystem capacity to produce services.

The development of ecological production functions (see previous section) provides a modeling
framework to make such long-run predictions and to understand the key characteristics of the
complex socioecological system that are likely to have the greatest impact on the system
through time. This exercise, whether with formal (bioeconomic) or informal (rules of
thumb) modeling approaches, requires assumptions of business-as-usual human use of the
ecosystem or continued sustainability of the ecosystem over time (UN et al. 2014). Some of these
assumptions are likely to be violated. The advantage of formal modeling, therefore, is the ability
to consider an ecosystem from many possible scenarios of economic use or ecosystem quality,
which can be an intensive task.

Because of the tremendous challenges, there are not yet any examples of comprehensive asset
valuation for ecosystems. However, a simpler approach to ecosystem asset valuation would be to
value the asset on the basis of a single critical service, depending on the policy needs. In the case
of coastal protection, for example, a policymaker might want to understand the trade-offs
among hard infrastructure, natural infrastructure (such as mangroves), or a hybrid combination
of hard and natural infrastructure. Typically assessments are based on the NPV over the
expected lifetime of the asset, produced or natural. By valuing only the coastal protection service
of mangroves and coral reefs, the asset value represents a lower bound on the asset value
because of the omission of other services, such as fisheries habitat. Some of the considerations
listed above must still be taken into account, but the calculation will be simpler than if one
attempts to measure and value all ecosystem services. The advantage is that this approach is
more readily implementable and can produce useful results for a policy maker.

5.6| Discussion
In general, while important progress has been made to develop and implement the SEEA-EEA,
considerable challenges remain. The incremental approach where countries can choose the level
of ambition best suited for them helps advance environmental accounting, despite the
challenges. Australia’s experiences in the state of Victoria and for the Great Barrier Reef region
provide some lessons about what attributes ease implementation of an account. Australia had a
great advantage in that national statistics on land ownership are spatially aligned with catchment
regions, making those catchments excellent areas to choose as EAUs and greatly facilitating
attribution of monetary information, if desired.

Countries beginning accounts could consider choosing EAUs that match existing spatially
delineated economic or biophysical data to ease implementation. Australia and the United
Kingdom used data that were already collected internally to measure extent and condition. Many
developed countries are likely to have such data, and compilation of an asset account based on

methodology for SEEA. Technical papers can be found on the website maintained by the Un Statistics Division

extent and condition may be a feasible first step and provide a spatial framework for the other
accounts. Australia’s decision to do only an example physical flow account, using existing data, is
likely to provide similar valuable learning for countries that have such data available. But for
developing countries, even this first step is likely to remain challenging. However, the increasing
availability of remote sensing data is likely to make at least simple ecosystem accounting feasible
in many countries in the near future. An important area of future research will be to determine to
what extent ecosystem services can be estimated using remote sensing data.

The following bullets summarize key points for each subsection:

Valuing coastal protection services in the ecosystem accounting context

•	There exists a large suite of tested tools for ecosystem service valuation. Each method is
  suited for some ecosystem services and each requires different types of data and data
  collection methods, from personal surveys to property prices and attributes and beyond.

•	Several valuation approaches are both useful for costal protection services and are aligned
  with the concept of exchange value used in the SNA and SEEA.

•	The Expected Damage Function approach is generally appropriate under the broadest
  circumstances and provides useful values for decision makers. The key factors include
  property value, past damages, and frequency of storm events. The development and
  greater use of biophysical models to assess the role of mangroves and coral reefs in
  preventing flooding and erosion could provide a systematic and consistent method to assess
  services. Some proxies for estimating property values for areas without well-established
  property registers are described in Chapter 4 and are likely to be relevant for developing
  countries.

•	Replacement cost valuation methods based on engineering solutions, such as seawalls or
  breakwaters, are the most commonly used method to value coastal protective services,
  particularly flood protection and storm surge protection, but they only provide valid estimates
  of value under highly restrictive conditions. While project-level analysis is likely to fulfill most of
  the requirements for using replacement cost methods accurately, the appropriateness of this
  method needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. It is unlikely to provide accurate
  estimates at a larger scale (regional or national).

•	Hedonic pricing methods may also provide useful information where there are well-
  functioning property markets. The approach relies on extensive data about property
  transactions and characteristics and may be challenging to implement in developing countries
  where extensive data on market transactions are often lacking.

•	Overall, the level of knowledge on the economic value of ecological protective services of
  mangroves and coral reefs is thin, especially in comparison to the understanding of the
  biophysical features of protective services. It is difficult to make conclusions about the
  absolute magnitude and spatial variability of the value of protective services given these
  limitations, which can particularly limit the use of benefit transfer approaches.

•	The methods for valuing the flow of coastal protection services are well defined and
  implementable, but serious challenges remain for measuring the asset value of the ecosystem
  providing this service.

Broader issues for ecosystem accounting

•	Experience so far has indicated that it will not be simple to create an EEA account covering the
  full suite of ecosystem services for an entire country.




                                                  125
                              Managing Coasts with Natural Solutions




•	It is best to start with a few key services, such as coastal protection services, recognizing that
   this underestimates the total asset value, but may be good enough for decision making.

•	One should choose EAUs that match existing, spatially delineated economic or biophysical
   data to ease implementation. Many developed countries are likely to have such data. An
   increasing number of developing countries have good biophysical data, and remote sensing
   may provide useful information, but the economic data are typically not spatially aligned,
   making it difficult to go beyond physical accounts.

•	It would be useful to implement pilot studies using information from historical events where
   data about storm intensity, flooding, economic damage, and so on are available to test and
   validate the approach described in this guidance note.

•	Because the EEA is experimental, it will be important to develop a database describing how
   each country goes about developing the accounts in the future with special attention given to
   coastal protective services (and intermediate services more generally).

6| Coastal Protection Services from Coral Reefs and
Mangroves in Policy and Practice: Case Studies
Michael W. Beck,h,i Montserrat Acosta-Morel,h Siddharth Narayan,j and Pam Rittelmeyeri

6.1| Summary
There is now a large and growing body of scientific evidence on reef and mangrove coastal
protection services. This chapter explores how that evidence has been used to make better-
informed decisions and to understand the incentives for these decisions. It presents relevant
case studies where the coastal protection benefits of mangrove and coral reef habitats were
explicitly linked to coastal zone management and habitat restoration decisions. These studies
offer compelling lessons on how coastal protection benefits have influenced coastal
management decisions.

The coastal protection benefits of mangroves and reefs have been deeply influential in both policy
and practice. More than 20 case studies were found and these could be grouped into five major
categories to identify the range of decisions influenced by the coastal protection role of reefs and
mangroves: (i) planning and land use decisions, including coastal zone management; (ii) coastal
defense infrastructure projects; (iii) national risk and adaptation planning; (iv) habitat restoration;
and (v) post disaster recovery. There are clear examples over the last several decades where these
perceived and measured benefits have led to significant habitat conservation and restoration
actions and changes in coastal policies. From review of the policies and projects, lessons learned
and opportunities to advance the use of mangroves and coral reefs for coastal protection were
identified. Most importantly, there have been a number of key triggers behind policy change and
decisions supporting natural coastal protection, including the following: (i) community-based
demand for coastal protection, particularly from mangroves; (ii) clear scientific evidence in ecology,
economics, and engineering of protection benefits and cost effectiveness of nature-based
defenses; (iii) international obligations and funding, particularly for green climate adaptation;
(iv) post-disaster rebuilding and restoration that incorporates ecosystems; and (v) demand for
other benefits, such as food security and jobs with natural coastal protection as an ancillary benefit.

6.2| Introduction
The world’s coastal zones are changing rapidly because of coastal development and climate
change; both of which will dramatically increase the risk of catastrophic damage to coastal
communities. Erosion, inundation, and extreme weather events affect hundreds of millions of
vulnerable people, important infrastructure, and tourism with significant losses to national
economies and major impacts on livelihoods. There have already been huge losses of coastal
habitats to development, which raises future risks by further exposing communities and assets
to more intense waves and winds.

Coastal and marine habitats, particularly coral reefs and mangroves, can substantially reduce
vulnerability and risk, providing “natural protection” from waves and storms. Yet the value of these
systems for natural and nature-based defense is still not fully recognized. Meanwhile, these systems
continue to be lost and degraded. In terms of loss statistics, there has been 30 to 50 percent habitat
loss for wetlands (Zedler and Kercher 2005), 19 percent loss of mangroves from 1980–2005

(Spalding et al. 2010), and 75 percent of the world’s coral reefs are now rated as threatened (Burke
et al. 2011). Often, the loss of these habitats is greatest around population centers. That is, exactly
where the most people could benefit from these ecosystems is often where their impacts and loss
have been the greatest. Without changes in both policy and perception as to the value of these
systems, societies can expect the trends in habitat loss to continue.

While mangroves and reefs face growing threats, there is opportunity to guide policy actions
toward conservation and restoration. Governments and businesses are showing increasing
interest in identifying where natural habitats and nature-based defenses can be cost effective for
coastal defense (for example, CCRIF 2010; van den Hoek 2012; NYC 2013; Temmerman et al. 2013).

This section identifies how information on reef and mangrove coastal protection services has
been used to inform decision making from the national to local scales. Coastal protection services
are increasingly accounted for in making decisions that go beyond SEEA and related approaches
that are covered in Chapter 5. However, there is a long way to go before consideration of natural
coastal protection alternatives becomes standard practice. This section identifies how and where
natural coastal protection services have been used successfully in the past to influence decisions
in the policy and practice of coastal management. This information is distilled in the section on
lessons learned and needs and opportunities to inform the future development of policies and
projects that use mangroves and reefs for coastal protection.

6.3| Methods
Case studies that linked coastal protection benefits to reef and mangrove conservation and
restoration decisions were identified. Most often, the case studies were targeted at specific
governmental decisions. Most of the studies included clearly led implementation actions (such as
habitats restored). Some studies were included, if governmental bodies commissioned or led
them (such as revisions to coastal zone management plans) and the studies were clearly aimed
at informing specific policies and decisions, even if the implementation was only considered to
be in progress.

This review only considered case studies on mangroves and reefs. It did not take into account
examples from marsh and oyster reef habitats, although there are many examples of these
systems providing similar protective services. It also did not look at studies that only measured
ecosystem services (see Chapter 5), unless they were aimed at a very specific decision. Scientific
studies that measured services from existing habitats were also not included. For example, the
studies examined in the Ferrario et al. (2014) reef review paper were not considered, because
these studies mainly measured services in situ. Many of these broader ecosystem services
studies are surely influencing decisions, but the focus for this review was on examples where the
link to decisions was explicit.

In addition, the review only considered projects that were designed to deliver some coastal
protection services. For example, there are thousands of reef restoration projects around the
world, but most are designed for fishery benefits, not coastal protection. Projects that were not
designed to restore or enhance existing habitats were excluded. For example, the review did not
include reef beach projects (see www.reefbeach.com) as most of these projects put artificial reef
structures in sandy nearshore environments that did not previously have reef habitat.

6.4| Results: The Influence of Protective Services on Coastal Policies and Practices
The review identified more than 20 case studies where the coastal protection services of
mangroves and reefs have been used in making decisions (Table 6.1). These examples are

extensive, but not exhaustive. Table 6.1 highlights some of the key characteristics of all of these
studies and the subsections below address eight of the case studies in greater depth.

The projects can be classified in to five main types:

a.	 Coastal Zone or Land-Use Decisions—Where accounting for ecosystem services and marginal
    values can influence land use, zoning, and development decisions.
b.	 Coastal Defense Infrastructure Projects—Where natural or nature-based defenses can be
    directly conserved and restored to contribute to risk reduction and coastal protection.
c.	 National Risk and Adaptation Planning—Where ecosystem conservation and restoration
    priorities are identified for their coastal defense and risk reduction benefits.
d.	 Habitat Restoration—Where ecological restoration programs consider ecosystem services,
    such as coastal protection in the selection and design of projects.
e.	 Post Disaster Recovery and Restoration—Where after a storm or tsunami there is support for
    the restoration of natural and nature-based defenses.

6.5| Case Studies

a. Coastal zone or land-use decisions
There are few examples where coastal protection services from reefs and mangroves are
influencing coastal zoning or land-use decisions at a large scale, such as national level (Table 6.1).
These examples are the rarest cases, which is not surprising given that they represent change at
a significant geographic and political scale. The examples from the Philippines provide the
clearest examples of long-term coastal planning with coastal protection specifically in mind.

Case Study 1: National Coastal Greenbelt Program of the Philippines: Coastal development in
the Philippines has led to more than a 50 percent loss of mangroves since 1900, mainly because
of conversion for aquaculture (Primavera 2005; Primavera et al. 2014). Between the 1950s and
the 1970s, the government implemented a pro-aquaculture policy under the assumption that the
mangroves were wastelands and of little value. In the 1970s, scientists began to document the
importance of mangroves to coastal fisheries and the government began to mandate some
mangrove protection. Over the past four decades, there have been a number of laws aimed at
restoring a greenbelt of mangroves along the coastline of the Philippines. However, violation of
the laws is common, and enforcement is lacking. Furthermore, the laws, policies, and regulations
have been fragmented and, at times, conflicting.

The emergence of scientific proof of the benefits of mangroves as protection from waves and
storm surges (as well as the direct experience from communities that are frequently exposed to
impacts of major storms) has fueled development of a comprehensive National Coastal Greenbelt
Action Plan. This plan, which is to be implemented at both the national and local levels, includes
protection of mangroves for both conservation and risk reduction through the establishment of a
100-meter-wide protection zone of mangrove and beach forest vegetation between the sea and
land, initially for the eastern Pacific seaboard of the Philippines, where typhoons make landfall.
The plan is contained in Senate Bill 2179, the National Coastal Greenbelt Act of 2014, which is
under consideration by the Senate of the Philippines as of May 2014 (see Appendix 6.1).

In sum in the Philippines, (i) there has been significant mangrove loss, (ii) laws and regulations
have existed for decades to protect mangroves for their benefits to fisheries, but have lacked
implementation, and (iii) recent storms coupled with stronger scientific information have
increased support and action for mangroves.

Case Study 2: Coastal Zone Management in Belize: The government of Belize tasked the
Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI) with the design of the Integrated
Coastal Zone Management Plan. To inform its development, the CZMAI partnered with the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Natural Capital Project (NatCap), who together focused in
particular on three critical ecosystem services: lobster fisheries productivity, recreational
activities, and coastal protection. NatCap developed an integrated database on biodiversity,
habitats, and marine and coastal uses. Then, together with local stakeholders, the team
formulated three possible future scenarios: a conservation scenario emphasizing sustainable use
and investment in coastal habitats; a compromise (“informed management”) scenario that
advanced development and conservation; and an infrastructure development scenario. These
scenarios were then examined in the InVEST tool (see Chapter 4 for more information on this
tool) to examine the tradeoffs among options as they relate to the value of the services in each
location, the quantity of services provided, and iterations of other possible scenarios.

The importance of coastal protection in the scenarios was clear. The benefits of coastal
protection, measured in terms of damages avoided, totaled billions of Belizean dollars, whereas
other benefits (tourism and lobster fisheries) totaled in the millions of BZ dollars (Figure 6.1).
There was significant trade-off in benefits. For example, more development would generate a
higher recreation value, but also much higher damages to infrastructure because of the loss of
coastal habitat protection. In these efforts, the development of appropriate alternative scenarios
proved to be one of the greatest difficulties in the assessment of benefits; it was difficult to get
stakeholders to visualize and articulate future scenarios, particularly at a national level (A. Guerry
pers. comm.; Gleason et al. 2010; Halpern et al. 2012).

The CZMAI finalized and submitted the Coastal Zone Management Plan in September, 2013, but
as of April, 2014, the plan had yet to begin implementation pending formal restructuring and
reestablishment of the Board of Directors of CZMAI and Cabinet endorsement. Nevertheless,
this case study provides valuable insight into the development of future coastal zone
management plans in the region. By categorizing marine and coastal uses and visualizing them
in maps, interest groups were better informed in their conflict resolution and negotiation of
competing interests.

In sum, (i) the CZMAI was tasked with developing a coastal zone management plan with the help
of alternatives assessed with InVEST and (ii) the scenarios developed in stakeholder workshops
were useful in presenting land-use tradeoffs to decision makers.

b. Coastal defense infrastructure projects
There are a growing number of projects where mangrove and reef habitats were restored or
enhanced for coastal protection (Table 6.1). These were the easiest studies to assess and draw
linkages between protection benefits and management decisions. It is particularly noteworthy
that some of the projects have grown to include thousands of hectares of restored habitat.

Case Study 3: Breaking the Waves: Impact Analysis of Coastal Afforestation for Disaster Risk
Reduction in Vietnam. Mangroves form an integral part of the coastal ecosystem of Vietnam,
although mangrove cover has been drastically reduced by deforestation and commercial
activities in recent times. The Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) attempted
mangrove reforestation as early as the 1960s without much success. In 1993, the MARD chapter
in the commune of Thai Binh proposed a renewed mangrove reforestation effort for coastal
protection to be headed by the Vietnam Red Cross (VNRC). This work was expanded to multiple
communes over 17 years with a total of $8.88 million spent on restoration. Mangrove cover has

since increased by nearly 9,000 hectares and about 100 kilometers of sea dyke are now
protected by VNRC-planted mangroves. These restoration efforts were often integrated with
artificial defenses (dykes) from the beginning.

The mangrove reforestation efforts were assessed for their cost-effectiveness and were found to
be highly beneficial across all eight communes. Benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) were positive, varying
from 3:1 to 28:1 (Table 6.2), even when only a few services were valued. Mangrove reforestation
proved effective in three communities that experienced storms, with much less flooding and sea
dyke damage compared to similar storms that struck before the mangroves were planted. The

avoided damages in these communities were estimated at $80,000 to $295,000, which are
quite substantial values given that the GDP per person in Vietnam is less than $1,300.

The initial restoration efforts were motivated less by formal valuations and benefit: cost analyses
(BCAs) than by experiences of aid group and village leaders. These stakeholders identified that
mangroves provided benefits to lives and livelihoods. These efforts then served as the basis for
quantitative BCAs, which may have also motivated later restoration efforts.

In sum, in Vietnam, (i) the MARD and VNRC initiated a mangrove reforestation project to
enhance and protect existing sea dykes and provide coastal protection; (ii) the project was
successfully extended to a total of eight communes covering 100 kilometers of sea dykes and
nearly 9,000 hectare of mangrove cover by 2010; and (iii) the projects were highly cost effective.

Case Study 4: Economic Valuation of Coral Reefs and Adjacent Habitats in American Samoa:
The coral reefs of American Samoa are some of the country’s most valuable assets. The
Department of Commerce (DOC) established the American Samoa Coastal Management
Program (ASCMP) in 1980 to protect and preserve its natural coastal resources, while ensuring
sustainable development. American Samoa suffers from an extreme coastal erosion problem.
Under the ASCMP, the Governor’s Coral Reef Advisory Group (CRAG) identified economic
evaluation of coral reef resources as a necessary tool for advancing understanding and
management of the reefs. In this regard, the DOC commissioned an economic evaluation of
American Samoa’s coral reefs and adjacent habitats.

The report identified that coral reefs were estimated to be worth $11 million per year in the region
in 2004, of which use values were approximately $1.4 million per year (Table 6.3), with shoreline
protection contributing roughly one third of the use values. Estimates of current erosion rates
and future shoreline protection measures indicate a cost saving of around $447,000 per year

($2,000/ square kilometer/year) from the existing 64 square kilometers of coral reefs near
eroding coastlines. These relatively low values for coastal protection benefits are a reflection of
the low extent of coastal infrastructure in the country. The vast majority of the coastal protection
value came from coral reefs along a single section of shoreline on the south shore of Tutuila with
a concentration of settlements and shoreline infrastructure.

The report also estimated the economic value of the 0.48 square kilometers of mangrove forest
that remains in American Samoa at a total of $1.5 million per year in 2004. Around 12 percent of
this value was from direct use values of which coast and flood protection was the largest
contributor, estimated at $135,000 per year. Similar to the reefs in Tutuila, all this value was
concentrated in a single section of mangrove forest in the Pala region.

In sum, (i) the U.S. Department of Commerce valued American Samoa’s coral reef and mangrove
habitats to inform its coastal management program; (ii) shoreline protection was estimated at
$447,000 per year for reefs and $135,000 per year for mangroves; and (iii) low values reflected
the lack of property behind these habitats.

c. National risk and adaptation planning
There is increasing emphasis being placed on the development of National Risk Reduction Plans
and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). As these plans are new, it may be easier to include natural
coastal protection benefits in them and reflect the latest rapid advances in the science and
practice of ecosystem-based adaptation.

In 2011, during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa,
governments agreed to develop NAPs to assess their vulnerabilities, mainstream climate change
risks, and prioritize adaptation measures. The NAP initiative was supported by the National
Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPA), which were developed by many of the least-developed
and developing countries to communicate priority activities addressing urgent and immediate
needs for climate change adaptation.

Case Study 5: Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility—Economics of Climate
Adaptation: The Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) is a risk-pooling facility
owned, operated, and registered in the Caribbean for its governments. It is designed to limit the

financial impact of catastrophic hurricanes and earthquakes to Caribbean governments by
quickly providing short-term liquidity after extreme events. It recently examined costs and
benefits of some 20 approaches for coastal risk reduction and adaptation (for example, from
mangrove restoration to new building codes) in eight Caribbean nations using an approach
developed by the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group (CCRIF 2010). It found that
reef and mangrove restoration were more cost effective than breakwaters across all eight
nations, even though the only ecosystem service considered was coastal defense. Moreover,
reef and mangrove restoration was one of the most cost-effective of all approaches in seven of
eight nations.

Using information provided by CCRIF and others (such as Bueno et al. 2008), the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) through the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC)
has developed several documents to frame their climate change adaptation actions. These
actions include general coordination among states, funding resources, mitigation measures,
adaptation efforts, and monitoring and enforcement in each country.37 Barbados has led the way
for other CCCCC member states in implementation of climate change adaptation since the
Barbados Program of Action for SIDS (1994). The Barbados Coastal Zone Management Unit has
been conserving its coral ecosystems and managing coastal areas from erosion and habitat loss
since 1996. Currently, it is developing a coastal zone management plan with support from the
Inter-American Development Bank that incorporates ecosystem-based climate change
adaptation.

In sum, (i) CCRIF has estimated the cost effectiveness of adaptation options across the
Caribbean; (ii) reef and mangrove restoration were among the most cost effective measures for
adaptation; and (iii) CARICOM nations have used this and other research to frame their climate
change adaptation strategies.

Case Study 6: Dominican Republic Climate Adaptation Action Plan: The Dominican Republic
is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, specifically sea-level rise, higher
temperatures, and increased precipitation variability. The Dominican Republic developed its
NAPA in 2008, emphasizing three priority sectors: agriculture and food security, water, and
coastal-marine resources. The NAPA proposed numerous adaptation options, including coastal
defenses aimed at the reduction of the coastal impacts of climate change (repair and
reconstruction of tourism infrastructure and beach damages) and indirect associated impacts
(reduction of hotel capacity, vector-borne diseases, negative spillovers to other sectors, and
unemployment). The NAPA also proposed to develop coastal management plans that include
reef restoration and afforestation, as well as the development of wetland and mangrove best
practices to meet coastal defense and conservation objectives.

In sum, the Dominican Republic’s National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) proposes
coastal habitats as a coastal defense alternative, specifically through reef restoration and the
development of wetland and mangrove best practices.

d. Habitat restoration
In most cases, the restoration of habitats for coastal protection benefits was motivated first and
foremost by risk reduction considerations and secondarily by conservation considerations


37	 For example, “Climate Change and the Caribbean: Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient

to Climate Change 2009–2015” and “Delivering Transformational Change 2011–2021: Implementing the
CARICOM Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change 2011–2021.”

(Table 6.1). In a few cases, projects were motivated first by conservation and secondarily by risk
reduction considerations. These projects were clearly different from the infrastructure projects
in (b) in that they were ecological restoration projects that sought also to enhance the delivery of
coastal protection ecosystem services.

Case Study 7: Community-Based Mangrove Restoration in Gujarat, India: The state of Gujarat
has the largest mangrove cover along India’s western coastline, but it has been extensively
degraded from natural and human causes. The State Forest Department and the Gujarat
Ecology Commission implemented a mangrove restoration project with financial support from
the India-Canada Environment Facility. The project focused on community-based restoration
initiatives and promoted a multiple-stakeholder mangrove restoration exercise. In addition to
enhancing mangrove cover, among the key objectives were the following: (i) to contribute to
increased understanding and acceptance of the need for local communities, institutions, and
industries to protect, conserve, and enhance mangroves; (ii) to enrich marine and coastal
biodiversity; and (iii) to encourage public participation in an eco-development program for
coastal villages and communities.

The targeted beneficiaries of the program are local fishing communities, marginal laborers, and
local industries. The program requires participating industries to plant mangroves and allocate a
specific area of coastal land for natural mangrove development. The reforestation exercise
resulted in a total of 8,326 hectares of new mangrove cover. A study of 227 households found a
variety of direct and indirect benefits accrued as a result of the reforestation exercise (Table 6.4).
For instance, there were reported gains in fisheries income in 34 households and reduced
cyclone and storm damages after mangrove planting in 74 households. As an indirect benefit, 54

households reported an increase in the employment of women from the program. Major
challenges to sustaining such a program include development of institutional mechanisms to
protect existing mangroves and determining the stakes and responsibilities of industries
operating in the coastal zone.

In sum, (i) the Gujarat State Government with other partners initiated a community-based
mangrove restoration program along the Gulf of Kuchch; (ii) principal beneficiaries and
participants were local villages, laborers, and fishing communities; and (iii) the eco-development
program resulted in 8,326 hectares of new coastal mangroves that provided increased coastal
protection and other benefits.

e. Post disaster recovery and restoration
There are a few examples where post-storm actions have included re-examination of coastal
management policies and direct support for coastal habitat restoration efforts (Table 6.1).

Case Study 8: Post-Typhoon Haiyan: Typhoon Haiyan, known as Typhoon Yolanda in the
Philippines, was one of the strongest and deadliest storms in the history of the Philippines. The
storm in November 2013, displaced millions and killed more than 6,000 people. Typically, around
20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year, with an increasing number in the super-typhoon
category, such as Typhoon Haiyan.

Local communities—and many scientists—believe that the past destruction of mangroves
contributed to the devastation brought on by the storm. Immediately following the typhoon,
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) announced a plan to spend
around $8 million to restore mangroves and beach forests along the coasts of Leyte and Samar
(Eastern Visayas region), the two islands that suffered the most damage from Haiyan. The
majority of the funds will pay residents who help with the reforestation in a cash-for-work
program.38 As of August 2014, approximately $840,000 has been budgeted to cover mangrove
planting on 9,800 hectares in this region, and work has already been completed on 600 of
these hectares.39

The government of the Philippines had previously adopted a flagship program to grow 1.5 billion
new trees on public lands throughout the country by 2016. The National Greening Program,
which focuses on inland forests as well as mangroves and beach forests, was established
through Executive Order 26 in 2011 with the goal of “poverty reduction, food security,
biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation and adaptation” (DENR 2011). Noting
that mangroves have been proven as buffer zones and protection in typhoon-affected regions,
the DENR established the coastal forest rehabilitation program in the Eastern Visayas on top of
the National Greening Program.40

There has been significant concern about the mangrove rehabilitation program. A four-month
scientific assessment of damaged mangroves and beach forest post typhoon revealed that
some of the mangroves that were intact before the storm only suffered minimal damage and
are recovering, and some were not damaged at all. Some of the mangrove planting to meet
social goals was having impacts on areas of natural ecological recovery, which were being

trampled, and mangroves were being planted in novel areas (for example, in seagrass beds).
Ecologists urged the national government to focus some efforts on ground surveys to
determine areas where there was a need for planting, establishment of coastal greenbelts,
reversion of abandoned fishponds to mangroves, and resettlement of coastal communities.41
According to the DENR, recent restoration efforts in the Leyte Gulf have implemented better
scientifically-informed techniques.42

In sum, after Typhoon Haiyan the Philippines (i) planned to spend $8 million dollars on mangrove
restoration; (ii) an existing national program served as precedent for a cash-for-work planting
program; and (iii) scientists stressed the need for better guidelines for planting and avoiding
damage to naturally growing mangroves.

6.6| Discussion
The coastal protection benefits of mangroves and reefs have been influential in policy and
practice in many locations across the globe (Table 6.1). There are clear examples over several
decades where these perceived and measured benefits have led to significant conservation and
restoration, as well as changes in coastal policies. These examples range from the national to the
local scales, and cover at least five major types of actions, including habitat restoration, post-
disaster recovery, and coastal zone management policies.

Most direct restoration projects are for mangroves and they are usually designed to meet
multiple benefits. The most common examples are designed for disaster risk-reduction goals,
but also meet conservation goals (for example, Vietnam and the Philippines, Table 6.1). At the
same time, a growing number of ecological restoration projects are planned for coastal
protection goals, as well. For example, NOAA increasingly evaluates its ecological restoration
efforts based on the multiple benefits, including coastal protection benefits and job creation
(Edwards et al. 2013, NOAA SAB 2014).

Many other countries, such as India, are clearly considering mangroves as bioshields for coastal
protection,43 although few projects have yet been implemented.44 Key scientists and foundations
in the country are pushing for more aggressive change and developing toolkits for mangrove
restoration for coastal protection (Selvam et al. 2005).

The focus of this review was on case studies with direct links to decisions in policy and practice. It
is likely that there have been many more indirect influences on policy and practice. The wealth of
science and case studies, particularly on the coastal protection values and benefits of
mangroves, is almost certainly having wide-ranging impacts. For example, past published
coastal protection work is clearly cited in efforts to influence policy (for example, see Senator
Aquino’s letter for the Philippine’s Greenbelt Bill, Appendix 6.1).

A better understanding of how to model coastal protection services in-depth can help decision
makers make more cost-effective investments within sites (for example, ports). Narayan
(2009) identified that mangrove islands were an under recognized part of effective protection
for the Dhamra Port in India. He used standard coastal engineering models to examine how

these benefits might be expanded effectively. Better valuations of their services (coastal
protection, fisheries, and tourism) can influence many land and sea-use decisions. For example,
Barbier et al. (2008) showed that leaving mangroves intact would deliver ten times more value in
terms of coastal protection, fisheries, and forest harvest services (for example, fuel wood or
honey), than cutting mangroves for aquaculture alone.

At national scales, it is also possible to assess risk with and without the presence of
coastal habitats, and these assessments should help inform decisions about where to
conserve and restore critical habitats. Arkema et al. (2013) identified qualitatively the
variation in coastal protection services from reefs, mangroves, and other coastal
habitats along the entire U.S. coastline. They showed that understanding this variation in
coastal protection services can help identify national-scale conservation priorities for
effective risk reduction, and these have informed the development of national-scale
decision support tools.

6.7| Conclusions
From the review of the policies and projects in this and prior chapters, there are clear lessons
learned and opportunities for expanding the practice and policy of natural coastal protection.
There are direct ties as noted below between the lessons learned and future opportunities and
needs.

There are a number of important triggers for policy change that have supported the use of
natural coastal protection including:

  i.	   Local knowledge and demand for coastal protection, particularly from mangroves
  ii.	 Demand for other benefits such as food security and jobs with natural coastal protection
       as an ancillary benefit
  iii.	 Clear evidence in ecology, economics, and engineering of benefits and cost effectiveness
        of mangroves and reefs for coastal protection;
  iv.	 International legal obligations and funding, particularly for climate adaptation
  v.	 Post-disaster rebuilding and restoration decisions that achieve multiple benefits for
      example, natural defense, conservation, and jobs).

Lessons learned

•	There are now decades of decisions supporting the conservation and restoration of
  mangroves and reefs for coastal protection.

•	Economics matter, but local observations can be paramount. Many early mangrove
  conservation and restoration efforts were motivated more by observations of habitat loss and
  flooding risk than by quantitative scientific or economic data.

•	Subsequent cost-benefit analyses show mangrove restoration to be cost effective for risk
  reduction and these studies have been increasingly influential.

•	Values of coastal protection will be highest where reefs and mangroves are in front of
  significant infrastructure. Cost-benefit estimates and valuations can widely vary, which is
  mainly related to the value of coastal assets behind reefs and mangroves.

•	Mangrove restoration for coastal protection is now a well-established practice. The
  practice can be done well over hundreds to thousands of hectares of coastline, although
  challenges remain.

•	Restored mangroves and reefs will cause shoreline evolution (for example, Guyana).
  Indeed the point from a coastal protection perspective often is to cause changes in erosion
  and sedimentation, which create land growth.

•	Mangroves and reefs should not be planted in “novel” areas. If reefs and mangroves did
  not previously occur in an area, they likely will not survive there now. Poorly conceived
  projects fail to meet goals, can create hazards, and make it harder to execute well designed
  projects later.

•	Coral restoration for coastal protection is much less well established; the numerous past
  coral restoration efforts were primarily designed to enhance fish production and recreation.

•	Teaming natural and artificial defenses can be very effective, such as mangroves in front of
  dikes (which was done in Vietnam).

•	It is not yet common practice to use coral reefs and mangroves for coastal protection.
  Even when analyses show that they can be used cost effectively for risk reduction, restoration
  may not be chosen because it is relatively novel practice compared to hard engineering (for
  example, Fiji).

•	Numerous National Adaptation Programs of Action for coastal countries did not obviously
  prioritize natural habitats for coastal protection benefits, while those for small island
  developing states often did prioritize natural coastal protection.

•	Significant land use and funding decisions are made post-disaster and these can support
  reef and mangrove restoration (for example, the Philippines).

Needs and Opportunities

•	Many well designed risk reduction plans, strategies, and programs are often not
  implemented. Vietnam and the Philippines stand in stark contrast, as they are proactively
  restoring mangrove habitats at scale.

•	The mapping of key decision pathways is critical to inform the science that is needed and in
  moving from plans to action.

•	It is critical to mainstream natural coastal defenses into national development and
  resilience strategies to move from plans to action.

•	More demonstration projects are needed to help identify when and where nature-based
  projects provide benefits. Societies have not reached a tipping point even for mangroves,
  where these projects are common practice.

•	Coastal planners and managers need better guidelines for siting and managing nature-
  based coastal defenses.

•	Post-project monitoring and evaluations are essential to gauge protection services, habitat
  quality, and maintenance costs.

•	There is an unmet need to model and measure erosion reduction values. Erosion reduction
  and land building are valued for artificial defenses but are not generally valued for natural
  defense.

•	Transparency matters in projects. Some reef restoration projects were excluded for lack of
  information on costs, approaches, and results.

•	The lack of stakeholder awareness on the effects of reef degradation on current erosion and
  flooding likely impedes support for coral reef restoration.

•	Too few hydrodynamic (engineering) models account for nature-based defenses.

7| Recommendations
Mangroves and reef can offer many coastal protection benefits. There are good approaches
for valuing these benefits and examples of how these approaches have been used in decision
making. A number of key recommendations can advance the valuation of these benefits and
their use in national accounting and other decisions. The following recommendations were
developed from the science and policy reviews (chapters 2 to 6) and input from 20 plus
experts who reviewed the work and participated in a review and synthesis workshop
convened December 3–5, 2014. The recommendations identify the critical needs and
opportunities in (i) data, (ii) models and methods, (iii) building support, and (iv) actions for
advancing the assessment and the incorporation of coastal protection values from coral reefs
and mangroves into making decisions. These recommendations are synthetic and targeted to
decision makers.

7.1| The Evidence Base and Data Gaps
Field measures, models, and demonstration projects provide strong evidence of the coastal
protection benefits of mangroves and reefs. Therefore, information per se is not the greatest
constraining factor in better uptake of the coastal protection role of mangroves and reefs, but
quite often the lack of direct experience by practitioners and decision makers seems to most
limit uptake.

•	Coral reefs and mangrove forests should no longer be considered to be a “novel” way to
  defend the coast. As offshore breakwaters, the basic engineering models of how reefs
  provide coastal protection are well known. Engineering demonstrations and models of the role
  of vegetation in flood and erosion reduction have been in use for decades.

•	The most important data gap in more accurately estimating reef coastal protection
  services is nearshore bathymetry, particularly near the reef crest. This is a critical and general
  gap for understanding coastal processes, flood risks, and erosion along many tropical
  coastlines. Greater emphasis should be focused on collecting this data using a variety of
  approaches, including depth sounding, side-scan sonar, imagery inference (such as SeaWifs),
  and Lidar.

•	The most important gaps in estimating mangrove coastal protection services are forest
  density and structure, which are used to estimate friction values in engineering models. The
  distribution and nearshore bathymetry is better detailed for mangroves, because they are
  intertidal.

•	Additional targeted projects are necessary to demonstrate how restored habitats can
  provide the most coastal protection benefits (that is, advance the practice of restoration
  for coastal protection). There are a growing number of demonstration projects, including
  mangrove restoration projects, at significant scale. Yet the projects have failed to reach a
  tipping point in influencing policy, even for mangroves habitats. Very few projects explicitly
  restore reefs for coastal protection benefits.

•	While information on engineering effectiveness is fairly well studied, information on the
  economic value of coastal habitat protection services is partly limited by the small
  number of studies currently available and by their restricted geographic coverage. This
  general lack of economic information restricts valuations of protection services. More studies
  are needed. It would be particularly useful to implement the modeling and EDF valuation
  approaches identified in this guidance note in a country where there are historical data to test
  and validate the models, such as the Philippines.

•	A perceived benefit of natural protection is lowered maintenance costs because coastal
  habitats have the ability for self-repair and growth with sea-level rise. These benefits need to
  be measured more directly.

•	In some cases, the biggest limiting factor in estimating coastal protection benefits is
  socioeconomic data (for example, on asset values). These values are central to many
  accounting problems, but can be surprisingly limited. Furthermore, to fully estimate coastal
  protection benefits for natural and artificial structures there needs to be better predictive
  models of future socioeconomic growth, similar to those done for future climate predictions.

7.2| Models and Methods
•	The modeling framework for estimating coastal protection benefits of habitats is clear
  (see Figure 4.2) and can follow well-known, existing approaches (for example, from coastal
  engineering, insurance, and the Economics of Climate Adaptation) for estimating benefits and
  cost effectiveness of other coastal infrastructure. Models exist that can be used at two major
  scales: (i) local or site-specific models that can be highly quantitative (including
  numerical) models, and (ii) national, regional, and global models.

•	Existing hydrodynamic can be advanced to more easily account for nature-based
  defenses. The modeling of reefs for coastal protection is very similar to that for breakwaters
  (and thus it is comparatively easy to extend existing tools, models, and parameters to account
  for reefs). However, the models and their parameterization for vegetated habitats (for
  example, mangroves and marshes) need to be more readily available. While complex models
  are needed for many circumstances, it would help if there were simpler models that could be
  more readily used by local practitioners (even if only for qualitative risk and coastal protection
  estimates).

•	The Expected Damage Function (EDF) approach is recommended for valuing coastal
  protection benefits. Caution should be applied when using replacement cost valuation to
  ensure it meets the necessary criteria, since the approach tends to overestimate values of
  coastal protection. But replacement cost valuation is recognized as a second best, and often
  easily implemented, approach, if it is not possible to do an EDF approach.

•	Purpose-specific models should be built for estimating the coastal protection benefits of
  mangroves and coral reefs. These models should cover cross-shore and longshore protection
  services. These purpose-specific models will better serve site-specific projects aimed at
  habitat conservation or restoration for coastal protection.

•	Surge-reduction models for mangroves can be advanced. Mangroves can play a critical role
  in storm surge reduction. However, better parameterization of the relationships between
  vegetation characteristics and friction is needed and this can be achieved through
  (i) simplified solutions for idealized geometries of mangrove trees and roots or (ii) numerically
  derived estimates for more complex modeling.

•	General ecosystem service models and tools could help in evaluating coastal protection
  benefits by developing more robust and standardized valuation methods from a wider
  geographic footprint. The present valuations and economic assessments are limited in context
  and geography (for example, most estimates of mangrove values are from rural
  environments).

•	Pilot projects are needed that incorporate coastal protection services into natural capital
  accounting. These projects should follow the approach in the UN Statistical Division (UNSD
  2013) System of Environmental-Economic Accounting/Experimental Ecosystem Accounting

  (SEEA/EEA). There are a number of issues that pilot projects should consider, such as
  developing estimates of future service flows and their valuation over time. However, such
  issues as Basic Spatial Units (BSU) and Land Cover/Ecosystem Functional Units (LCEU) may
  be very straightforward to develop for protective services of reefs and mangroves (see
  Chapter 5).

•	For mangroves and reefs (and natural defenses in general), better modeling and
  measuring of erosion reduction values is needed. Although erosion reduction (and land
  building) is an important benefit from reefs and mangroves, it is not generally valued as a
  natural defense. The causes of erosion can be very localized and difficult to assess, making it
  hard to develop clear and general relationships between habitats and coastal erosion.

7.3| Building Public and Governmental Support
It is critical to bring natural coastal defenses into national development, coastal management,
climate adaptation, disaster risk management, and resilience plans. To do so will require the
development of public support and political will.

•	Many well designed risk reduction plans, strategies, and programs are often not
  implemented and this needs to change. This guidance note identified many adaptation and
  coastal zone management plans that considered natural coastal protection benefits that have
  not been implemented. Vietnam and the Philippines stand in stark contrast as they are
  proactively restoring mangrove habitats at scale.

•	Many countries need to develop national coastal risk maps. This is a critical first step for
  overall risk reduction and nature-based coastal protection. Many countries are moving toward
  developing these maps, creating opportunities to include natural protection benefits in
  planning.

•	These national risk maps should identify where and how much risk reduction value is
  currently provided by reefs and mangroves. The critical point of such maps is to
  demonstrate the variation in coastal protection (that is, where reefs and mangroves offer
  some of the greatest values in national coastal protection). These maps would also prioritize
  where coastal habitat protection and restoration offer the greatest risk reduction benefits.

•	The lack of stakeholder awareness likely impedes coral reef restoration. Because coral
  reefs are below the surface, it is difficult for stakeholders to see reef degradation and connect
  it to above water changes in erosion and flooding. Yet it is well known from coastal engineering
  that small degradations in the height of offshore breakwaters can have huge impacts on
  erosion and flooding.

•	A better accounting of the roles that reefs have played in coastal protection is needed to
  build awareness of their benefits. The study of past impacts offers one pathway. It is
  important to monitor the recovery of coral reefs and changes in flooding and erosion after
  major disruptions to understand the relationship between reefs and coastal protection
  benefits. For example, the global coral bleaching in 1998 offered opportunities to study such
  changes.

•	There is value in estimating coastal protection benefits at both local and national levels.
  The types of decisions and decision makers are often quite different at these levels.

•	Specific projects for risk reduction and climate adaptation should be implemented locally
  and must be designed for local conditions. National mapping will help to focus, identify, and
  provide priorities for national decisions, but cannot replace the need to design projects locally.

7.4| Actions to Sustain and Enhance the Coastal Protection Value of Coral Reefs
and Mangroves
•	Reducing threats to mangroves and coral reefs and improving their management offer the
  most cost-effective solutions to retaining their coastal protection services.

•	Reefs and mangroves should be restored for their coastal protection benefits. Restoration
  has been shown to be cost effective for coastal protection in comparison to other approaches,
  such as submerged breakwaters. However, restoration should not be used to create “novel”
  habitats, that is, putting mangrove or reef-like structures in areas where they did not previously
  exist.

•	Mangrove and reef coastal protection projects should be designed to measure and value
  socioeconomic benefits and, in particular, to inform national ecosystem accounting.

•	Guidelines and best practices for restoration of mangroves and reefs for coastal
  protection should be advanced. The body of guidance on mangrove restoration is growing
  and while it is very good, it can still be enhanced. There is little guidance on best practices for
  reef restoration for coastal protection.

•	New, large-scale commitments to restore degraded mangroves and coral reefs should be
  developed. Restoration efforts in Vietnam have shown that the amount (hectares) of
  mangrove conservation and restoration can be brought to the same scale as the past loss of
  these habitats. Few (if any) other countries have made such commitments.

•	Better measures for coastal protection benefits are needed to attract innovative and
  sustainable financing through mechanisms such as climate bonds, blue infrastructure bonds,
  green adaptation funds, and insurance that accounts for protection benefits.

•	More developing nations should include reefs and mangroves in their national adaptation
  plans.

•	More developed nations should incorporate coral reef and mangrove management and
  restoration in to their support programs for adaptation and risk reduction (for example, in
  green adaptation funds).
