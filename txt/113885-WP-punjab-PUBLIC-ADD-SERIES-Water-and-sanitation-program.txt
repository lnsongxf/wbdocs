 Rural water access is at 96 percent, exceeding the MDG target of 94 percent. Urban water coverage is at 91 percent, and unlikely to meet the MDG target
of 98.5 percent. Rural sanitation access at 40 percent falls well short of the MDG target of 54 percent. Urban sanitation at 84 percent is also estimated to fall
short of the MDG target of 89 percent using current projections.

Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively
turned into services, are:

  Priority actions for the Institutional Framework
  •	 Immediately (in 2013) carry out a province-wide stakeholder analysis to map and document the multiple stakeholders in the sector
     and their current roles (as mandated and de facto).
  •	 Reach institutional clarity within the sector to align the sector, rationalize mandates and address historical issues of fragmentation.
     Develop a consensus-based framework by December 2013 to segregate roles and responsibilities: (i) regulator; (ii) water production
     (broader water issues and integrated water management); (iii) water assets and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) (service provision).
  •	 Prioritize passage of the draft Punjab Municipal Water Act (by mid-2013) to ensure legal provision for regulation of the sector.
  •	 Ensure a “regulatory body” is created by December 2013 in accordance with the draft Punjab Municipal Water Act. The watchdog
     body will require sustained policy and financial support. It will provide for a long-term sector perspective with regulatory functions
     to cover: (i) compliance with environmental regulations and monitoring of water quality; (ii) groundwater abstraction; (iii) tariff
     setting; (iv) providers’ performance; and (v) protection of customer interests.
  •	 Review the service cadres engaged in sector service delivery (at all levels) with a view to developing a coherent service cadre
     for the sector by Financial Year (FY) 2014. Assess existing capacities and human resources needs for: (i) strategic planning
     and management; (ii) engineering and technical; (iii) financial management; (iv) urban management; and (v) social/community
     development/customer focus.




  Priority actions for Financing and Its Implementation
  •	 High levels of advocacy within the Government of Pakistan to ensure that the required investment levels for each subsector are
     tapped from within “provincial” resources. Lobby and obtain approvals for a minimum percent annual budget allocation for the
     water and sanitation sector.
  •	 Support for advocacy with federal government and selected donors to tap additional projects and funding for new and existing
     water and sanitation initiatives.
  •	 Mandate the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASAs), Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) and Tehsil Municipal
     Administrations (TMAs) to raise sector funding from markets and other sources.
  •	 Promote “public private partnerships” in water and sanitation through a clear policy and targeted marketing campaign.
  •	 Immediate attention on comprehensive financial information management, including consolidated annual data collection and
     reporting with a particular focus on subsector allocations and expenditure tracking.
  •	 Review and further rationalize institutional mandates and jurisdictions between WASAs, PHEDs and TMAs.




  Priority actions for Sector Monitoring and Evaluation
  •	 Prioritize and fast track the development of a sector information management system. Agreement on the principles of management
     of the Sector Management Information System (SMIS), integration with planning processes and sustained resourcing needs to be
     urgently reached by mid-2013, with the system in place by December 2013.
  •	 Definitional consistency and harmonization between the macro-sources of data (Multi-indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Pakistan
     Living Standards Measurement Survey (PLSMS), Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Census, and so on), which will also allow
     for triangulation and a better understanding of coverage and equity. The indicators should be defined with the longer-term
     perspective of monitoring outcomes in a post-Millennium Development Goal (MDG) scenario.
  •	 Review departmental and existing systems of monitoring (at all tiers of government) in 2013. Determine capacity needs and where
     to strengthen existing structures for better and more systematic generation of information, in relation to physical assets, financial
     management and service delivery/customer focus. Third party audits and performance monitoring to be systematically carried out
     and built into the work-plans of oversight bodies and the Regulator.

Punjab Service Delivery Assessment




    Priority actions for Rural Water Supply
    •	 Rehabilitation of nonfunctioning schemes verified as demand-based.
    •	 Accepting Community Based Organizations (CBOs) as legal entities with ability to raise funds, extend coverage/services and access
       technical and financial support services from PHED.
    •	 Significant increases in budgetary allocations (capital/recurring expenditures) from the provincial/federal government to ensure
       current level of coverage is sustained.
    •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for ‘policy’, ‘regulation’ and ‘service provision’ supplemented by support for
       subsector coordination and planning.



    Priority actions for Urban Water Supply
    •	 Revisit the policy, mandate and structure of the five WASAs and TMAs with a view to introduce needed autonomy and reforms
       including the introduction of performance based systems; authority for appropriate adjustment of tariffs; hiring and firing; and
       raising of finances to ensure effective service provision and cover annual costs; an ‘institutional reform plan” for WASAs and TMAs
       should be developed and approved by the provincial government in 2013.
    •	 Starting with FY 2013, an annual tripling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures) should be ensured.
    •	 Balance subsector budget needs should be ensured from the federal government and selected donors to ensure that the Capital
       Expenditures (CAPEX) gap identified by the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) is fully covered and MDG targets are met.
    •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be reflected in the “institutional
       reform plan” for the subsector.
    •	 Systems for subsector planning, coordination and oversight should be ensured through: i) required data bases/Management
       Information System (MIS) and notification of subsector along with the Terms of Reference (TORs).
    •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Punjab. Water and Sanitation Program (WSP),
       for example, can play a key role with provision of technical assistance and other support.




    Priority actions for Rural Sanitation and Hygiene
    •	 Designation of a clear institutional home for rural sanitation and hygiene, and creation of a Punjab Open Defecation Free (ODF)
       Task Force, comprised of PHED and Health, Local Government and Community Development and Education departments and
       other key stakeholders, which is mirrored at the district and subdistrict levels.
    •	 Prioritization of safe human excreta disposal over other aspects of sanitation (for example, liquid and solid waste and street
       pavements, and so on) in the interim period, requiring at least 30 percent of departmental budgetary allocations, till open
       defecation practices are eradicated.
    •	 Formulation and implementation of a well-coordinated Provincial Rural Sanitation Acceleration Roadmap at scale with well-
       defined targets and subtargets for all tiers of local government based on the Provincial Sanitation Strategy.



    Priority actions for Urban Sanitation
    •	 Ensure that environmental laws and regulations are fully complied with in regard to sewerage treatment; this will entail clarity
       on roles and responsibilities for regulation; new institutional capacities as well as needed mandates and resources for effective
       regulation.
    •	 Revisit the policy, mandate and structure of the five WASAs and TMAs with a view to introduce needed autonomy and reforms
       including the introduction of performance based systems; authority for appropriate adjustment of tariffs; hiring and firing; raising
       of finances to ensure effective service provision and coverage of annual costs; an institutional reform plan for WASAs and TMAs
       should be developed and approved by the provincial government in 2013.
    •	 Starting with FY2013, an annual tripling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures) should be ensured.

  •	 Balance subsector budget needs which should be ensured from the federal government and selected donors to ensure that the
     CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is fully covered and MDG targets are met.
  •	 Clear segregation or roles and responsibilities for policy, regulation and service provision should be reflected in the institutional
     reform plan for the subsector.
  •	 Systems for subsector planning, coordination and oversight should be ensured through: i) required databases/MIS; and ii) notification
     of subsector for along with TORs.
  •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Punjab. WSP, for example, can play a key role
     with provision of technical assistance and other support.
  •	 Third party reviews of the Lahore Waste Management Company ( LWMC).
  •	 Further improvements and expansion of areas currently un served by LWMC.
  •	 Planning and implementation of similar models for solid waste management systems in other urban centers of Punjab.

        O&M (service provision).
     •	 Prioritize passage of the draft Punjab Municipal Water Act (by mid-2013) to ensure legal provision for regulation of
        the sector.
     •	 Ensure a “regulatory body” is created by December 2013 in accordance with the draft Punjab Municipal Water
        Act. The watchdog body will require sustained policy and financial support. It will provide for a long-term sector
        perspective with regulatory functions to cover: (i) compliance with environmental regulations and monitoring of
        water quality; (ii) groundwater abstraction; (iii) tariff setting; (iv) providers’ performance; and (v) protection of
        customer interests.
     •	 Review the service cadres engaged in sector service delivery (at all levels) with a view to developing a coherent service
        cadre for the sector by Financial Year (FY) 2014. Assess existing capacities and human resources needs for: (i) strategic
        planning and management; (ii) engineering and technical; (iii) financial management; (iv) urban management; and

     •	 Prioritize and fast track the development of a Sector Information Management System (SMIS). Agreement on the
        principles of management of the SIMS, integration with planning processes and sustained resourcing needs to be
        urgently reached by mid-2013, with the system in place by December 2013.
     •	 Definitional consistency and harmonization between the macro sources of data (MICS, PSLMS, Demographic and
        Health Survey (DHS), Census, and so on), which will also allow for triangulation and a better understanding of
        coverage and equity. The indicators should be defined with the longer-term perspective of monitoring outcomes in a
        post-MDG scenario.
     •	 Review departmental and existing systems of monitoring (at all tiers of government) in 2013. Determine capacity
        needs and where to strengthen existing structures for better and more systematic generation of information, in relation
        to physical assets, financial management and service delivery/customer focus. Third party audits and performance

    •	 Revisit the policy, mandate and structure of the five WASAs and TMAs with a view to introduce needed autonomy
       and reforms including the introduction of performance-based systems; authority for appropriate adjustment of tariffs;
       hiring and firing; and raising of finances to ensure effective service provision and cover annual costs; an ‘institutional
       reform plan’ for WASAs and TMAs should be developed and approved by the ‘provincial government” in 2013.

    •	 Starting with FY 2013, an annual tripling of the subsector budget allocations (capital/recurring expenditures) should
       be ensured; balance subsector budget needs should be ensured from the federal government and selected donors to
       ensure that the CAPEX gap identified by the SDA is fully covered and MDG targets are met.

    •	 Clear segregation of roles and responsibilities for ‘policy’, ‘regulation’ and ‘service provision’ should be reflected in the
       ‘institutional reform plan’ for the subsector.

    •	 Systems for subsector planning, coordination and oversight should be ensured through: i) required data bases/MIS;
       and notification of the subsector for along with Terms of Reference (TORs).

    •	 Advocacy with selected donors to plan, design and fund new subsector projects for Punjab. WSP, for example, can
       play a key role with provision of technical assistance and other support.
