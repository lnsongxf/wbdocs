                    e would like to thank all of those who participated in,
                    attended, and contributed to the Understanding Risk
                    Austria Conference (URAT). This was the first Country
                    conference of a developed country and Austria didn’t
                    disappoint! While we cannot mention all the institutions
and individuals who contributed to the planning and execution of the
event, we would like to highlight some key partners. First, we would like

Geodynamik (ZAMG), The World Bank, and the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). We would also like to give a special

T
           he first edition of the Understanding Risk Austria Conference
           (URAT) was an unquestionable success, bringing together
           for the first time policy makers, risk modelers, insurance,
           risk communicators, academia, and practitioners (private and
           public sectors) from all the corners of Austria to meet, learn,
and share best practices in disaster risk management and adaptation to
climate change.

The upcoming Austrian national ISDR Platform and the World Bank
provided the basis for the organization and creative interaction of
different ministries, federal governments, scientific institutions and actors
from the private sector.

During January 20th and 21st of 2016, the city of Vienna hosted the
first Understanding Risk Conference for a developed country, URAT. The
event was hosted with all the elegance and charm of a city that breads
culture and at the same time that has suffered from flood disasters in
the past. The City Hall or “Rathaus” hosted the Opening Ceremony and
the URAT Ignites. The next day we moved to the “Vienna Old Stock
Exchange”, where the eight sessions took place. Almost 300 people
participated of the two day event where the talent and expertise of
Austria’s communities, scientists, technologists, NGO’s, private sector and
government to develop shared understanding of the challenges we face
in building long-term resilience to natural hazards; the impacts of climate
change; and develop innovative solutions to meet them.

Probably the builders of the St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna must
have been cognizant of the country’s exposure to floods, landslides,
and avalanches and other natural hazards when building this impressive
site. The pattern of the roof tiles resembles earthquake waves, the
snowy mountains, and the rivers around cities. Maybe, when you live in a
country that understands its risks so well, you never stop to put much
thought into the efforts that national, regional, and local governments
do to reduce this risk. Austria’s knowledge and experience in dealing with
disaster reduction is impressive, and we hope that with initiatives like the
Understanding Risk Forum, this can be shared internally and even more
widely.

Mag. Gerald Czech
(Austrian Red Cross) –
“Risk Communication or
Communication as Risk?”
Starting with a brief introduction
of risk resilience, the risk
communication concept was linked
to emergent social characters,
to risk and coping strategies, and
to the question of participation
instead of education. The risk
society was elaborated by
explaining that risk is constructed,
that one has to face ideological
problems, and that there is a
discrepancy between experts and
their opinions and the trust of
the actors involved herein. It was
concluded that the communication
of resilience is seen as a challenge
for the future; an integrated
approach combining risk and crisis
communication is needed which
must be implemented in both
vertical and horizontal dimensions
of society and which must utilize
various types of social media in

Introduction:
Austria: Flooding and
Innovation
Based on its geographical location
in the Alpine arc, Austria has
always been characterized
by natural hazards such as
rockfall, avalanches, mudslides,
and flooding. Flooding ranks
highest among natural hazards
in terms of damage potential
(e.g., damages amounted to
€870 million in 20131). Ingenuity
is key to enabling people to                      of emergency situations. Chance          situation. However, they can
develop strategies and tools to                   or curiosity also plays a vital role.    prove to be beneficial and propel

from invention to innovation is                   when something that already exists       for identifying the requirements
necessary in order to achieve                     is improved, or when something           to develop innovative approaches

 Political standpoints differ from those of the professionals in the field of flood safety. It is imperative to keep this very fact

 Operators and officials should have the courage to carry out innovations; there are many ideas, but little is implemented
 There should not only be criticism concerning everything, we are all in the same boat (population, experts…)
 No technical innovation without social innovation
