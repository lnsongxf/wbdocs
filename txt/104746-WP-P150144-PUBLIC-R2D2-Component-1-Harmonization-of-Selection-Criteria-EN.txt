Executive Summary
1.       Romania faces today the critical need to enhance the coordination of public
investment programs and projects in order to “do more with less,” maximizing
development impact given limited financial resources available. Examples of persistent
challenges abound in the country and are hard to miss (e.g., deficient roads infrastructure,
at all territorial levels; lack of access to water and sanitation in many rural areas;
inadequate social infrastructure; governance and public administration challenges, etc.). At
the same time, the need for infrastructure investments in Romania is considerable and the
corresponding costs far exceed what EU funds alone can cover, even if the government was
successful at driving the absorption close to 100%. Estimates by the World Bank show that,
in addition to EU funds, Romania would need to contribute around EUR 30 billion through
2020 to cover needs in three key sectors: county and communal roads, water and
wastewater, and social infrastructure. 1 In water and wastewater alone the gap exceeds EUR
20 billion, and Romania could face serious sanctions after 2018 if it does not achieve EU-
level targets on coverage and service quality.

2.      In this context, “value for money” is the key guiding principle of public
investments, making this final report is both critically important and timely . Romania’s
preparations for the 2014-2020 EU programming period are in full swing, with multiple
operational programmes recently approved. In parallel, the Government is working on
revamping instruments financed entirely from the state budget. The core focus is on the
National Local Development Program (PNDL), the main state-budget-funded investment
program for local infrastructure development, though findings and recommendations may
be extrapolated to other state-budget-funded instruments (e.g., the Environment Fund)
and, indeed, as decentralization and regionalization may evolve in the future, subnational
governments may also apply the lessons of this work.

3.      The main client of this work is the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA), which manages the PNDL. Other key stakeholders include the
Center of Government (CoG), the Ministry of Public Finances, the Ministry of European
Funds, other central authorities in charge of EU and/or state-funded investment programs,
Regional Development Agencies, and county and local councils. In particular, this
assessment covers the following types of public infrastructure investments: county roads;
communal roads; water; wastewater; and social infrastructure (in education, health,
culture, and sports).

4.       The main goal of this work is to recommend and facilitate the adoption of
prioritization and selection criteria that enhance coordination at the level of
infrastructure programs and the projects they finance. Especially in comparison to EU
funds and particularly in the Romanian context, a core issue that has plagued state-budget-
funded instruments is the lack of clarity and rigor in selecting investments. Stakeholders
across the public, private, and nonpr ofit sectors perceive such programs as “black boxes,”

                                                                                                     1
wondering how and why some projects receive funding while others do not. By adopting a
set of clear, coordinated criteria and a transparent methodology for applying them to a
portfolio of new and ongoing proposed investments, state-budget-funded programs like
the PNDL would boost their impact and credibility among interested applicants. There
would thus be less room to question decisions regarding funding allocations, as these
would be grounded in a defined, more objective, and transparent methodology. This is the
intent of this report, along with contributing to the harmonization of procedures across EU
and state-budget-funded programs. If investments follow the same rules, a pipeline of
projects can be created with state-budget funding and then transferred to EU-funded
programs, as needed/as feasible, thereby helping boost absorption going forth (as of July
2015, Romania still ranks last in the EU for overall absorption of 2007-2013 funds).

5.      In addition to criteria per se, this report evaluates two additional instruments for
enhancing coordination: multiyear budgeting and territorial contracts. These are included
here based on the interest expressed by the MRDPA and taking into account their potential
for generating improvements to the way public investments are planned and implemented
in Romania. Multiyear budgeting would allow a program like the PNDL to function on a
framework spanning a time horizon longer than a single year, much like EU-funded
programs, which would enhance predictability and enable the government to finish
projects in a timely and fiscally sustainable fashion. Territorial contracts between sub-
national and national authorities are currently used in other EU member states to ensure a
more stable implementation framework for investment programs, across all types of
financing sources (EU and state budget), along with setting aside the funding required for
the completion of an agreed set of infrastructure projects.
The current report assesses several coordination mechanisms




Note: The report on “Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State -Funded Investments in
Romania’s Infrastructure,” submitted in April 2015, covers the “Enabling Environment” and other types of
coordination mechanisms (e.g., dedicated platforms).



                                                                                                           2
6.       Coordination refers to the capacity of different stakeholders to work together for
achieving specific goals . From a bottom-up perspective , coordination is needed when local
governments do not have the financial and human resources needed to address the basic
infrastructure needs of their communities, so higher-level authorities (i.e., regional and/or
national governments) have to intervene to fill the gap. Communes in Romania can, on
average, only afford to rehabilitate, say, one road and one school during the 2014-2020
programing cycle. 2 From a top-down perspective , coordinated infrastructure investments
promise to be cheaper and deliver greater benefits. If two different authorities are
implementing investment programs that have the same goals and target the same
beneficiaries, it is likely that they are duplicating their efforts and, hence, missing out on
cost-saving opportunities. Coordination can also generate more impact, making the whole
greater than the sum of the parts. If a new school or hospital gets built, the road connecting
to it should also be rehabilitated; if a county rehabilitates a county round, the neighboring
county may also consider rehabilitating a segment that connects to that investment. Last
but not least, coordination helps avoid many of the pitfalls of projects designed and
implemented separately, without proper sequencing. There are countless examples across
Romania of paving roads before introducing or rehabilitating water/sewage/gas networks;
soon after the road work is done (sometimes within a matter of days), utility providers
come in and, with the permit in hand from the local authorities, destroy the pavement to
get to the utility networks. 3

7.      The scope of the current report is centered primarily on the PNDL and several
related instruments for enhancing coordination of public investments at the local and
county level. A broader discussion of coordination issues within and across sectors and
covering the entire project cycle (planning, financing, execution, monitoring and control) is
included in the report on “Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State-
Funded Investments in Romania’s Infrastructure” (World Bank, 2015), delivered as part of
the same technical assistance. The same report also discusses the potential pitfalls of “over -
coordination, ” particularly in the context of low capacity in Romania’s public sector. 4


Financing Criteria
8.       There are two main approaches to enhanced coordination through financing
criteria: equivalency and complementarity. On the one hand, harmonized criteria can be
equivalent across investment programs. This is appropriate particularly when the needs in
the sector far outweigh the supply of funds and there are also clear requirements to fund
particular investments. On the other hand, harmonized criteria can be complementary
across investment programs. That means that in a given sector one may define from the
start of a programming period the list of eligible types of investments for each fund.

Together, these lists should be “MECE” – mutually exclusive, comprehensively exhaustive.
In other words, there would be no overlaps and, as a whole, the funds would serve the full
range of needs in a sector.

9.       The optimal approach varies by sector; there is no one-size-fits-all answer. For
example, in the roads sector, the EU-funded Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2014-
2020 will focus on county roads connecting to the TEN-T network; the PNDL could take on
county roads that do not connect directly to TEN-T, but remain a priority based on a
number of other criteria (e.g., located in the area of a major urban center, high number of
beneficiaries, etc.). By contrast, for the water and sanitation sector, the PNDL should
maintain the EU requirements of focusing on localities over 50 people for water and over
2,000 p.e. for sewage systems, in accordance with Water and Wastewater Master Plans.
Why not focus on localities that are not eligible for EU funds through the Large
Infrastructure OP or the PNDR 2014-2020? The answer is simple: the priority lists have
already been established by the Master Plans based on clear criteria, and Romania still
needs to fulfill EU-level commitments in the water and wastewater sector. Finally, for social
infrastructure, the PNDL should make sure that it evaluates and prioritizes investments
based on criteria similar to those used by EU funds – these are sensible criteria for making
sure that the investments have the desired impact (e.g., sufficient number of students or
/patients, adequate focus on marginalized and/or low-income communities, etc.).

10.     The diagnostic assessment of current financing criteria under EU and state-
budget-funded investment programs confirms that there are critical and persistent
differences between the two types of funding. Criteria applicable to EU-funded programs
are defined in a complementary manner, with a conscious effort to coordinate
interventions, while state-budget-funded programs reviewed make no attempt to
coordinate among themselves and with other EU instruments, but instead finance a long list
of investments, causing significant overlaps with other programs. This creates a competitive
dynamic among funds, with state-budget-funded instruments typically crowding out EU
investments because they finance the same types of interventions under more flexible rules
and monitoring. Moreover, there is no attempt to leverage synergies across programs.

11.    Fortunately, Romania’s experience with EU funds provides plenty of examples of
good practices that should be replicated for state-budget-funded programs like PNDL:
         A purposeful focus on coordination: Each EU Member State is required to explain
          how it will ensure complementarities across structural funds, starting with the
          programming documents approved by the EC before implementation can begin.
          For instance, the Romania-EU Partnership Agreement 2014-2020 clearly notes:
          “The complementarities identified among European Structural and Investment
          Funds require an effective coordination during planning and implementation […] i n
          order to avoid the overlaps between actions.”5
         Programming anchored in real needs and priorities: EU-funded programs draw
          from and correlate with relevant strategic documents, both cross-sectoral (e.g., the

                                                                                            4
          Romania-EU Partnership Agreement, the Convergence Programme, etc.) and
          sectoral (e.g., the General Transport Master Plan, the National Health Strategy,
          etc.). These priorities are generally stable across time, so stakeholders know what
          to expect and can plan accordingly: what programs finance which types of
          interventions, under which eligibility conditions, in what timeframe, etc.
         A predictable and stable timeline, with multiyear budgeting and an effective IT
          infrastructure : The seven-year EU programming cycle (e.g., 2007-2013, 2014-2020)
          maintains the same strategic objectives, planning documents, and implementation
          procedures throughout. Even if political power alternates in that timeframe, no
          changes occur to EU operational programmes and their corresponding funding
          once these are agreed with the EC in the first year. Stability fosters opportunities to
          coordinate for enhanced impact. In all this effort, it is critical to rely on a functional
          and effective data collection and data sharing system.
         A common legal and procedural framework across all EU-funded programs: The
          Common Provisions Regulation No. 1303/2013 were adopted to: establish a clear
          link with the Europe 2020 strategy; improve coordination; ensure steady
          implementation; and facilitate potential beneficiaries’ access to the funds. 6 All
          programs have similar application procedures and a rigorous, transparent selection
          process, explained in depth in their respective Applicant Guides.

         Increasingly effective citizen engagement throughout the entire process: from
          designing a community’s strateg y to individual project cycles (from pre- to post-
          implementation). The new Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) instrument is
          a testimony to the increased focus on citizen engagement in EU-funded operations.

12.      All these elements are critically important for establishing a solid foundation for
coordination and, indeed, they all affect the choice of financing criteria for the PNDL and
other state-budget-funded instruments. A purposeful focus on coordination means that
from the start investment programs are designed to have financing criteria that are
equivalent or complementary, depending on the sector. Financing criteria can also
encourage coordination by prioritizing (e.g., through “bonus points’ in the evaluation
process) integrated interventions – i.e., proposals that prove to be coordinated across
sectors and/or across administrative levels. This was the approach of the EU-funded PNDR
2007-2013, and it is the new approach of the ROP 2014-2020 with respect to strategic
county roads investments in each region. When programming is anchored in real needs, it
enables the design of financing criteria that deliver high potential impact and still
demonstrate financial sustainability (more on this below). In addition, a multiyear timeline
and budget enables managing authorities of EU and state-funded programs to coordinate
interventions over a longer time horizon, reducing the risk of cannibalization between the
two types of funding. Finally, a common procedural framework for all state-budget-funded
programs – harmonized with EU-funded instruments – requires transparent, clear, and
specific selection criteria. This would deliver added credibility and broader appeal for state-
funded programs like the PNDL and would also enable projects to move between different

pipelines more easily. Whenever there is sufficient room under EU funds, projects should
always be financed through such resources, which are nonreimbursable (and, hence, much
cheaper than state-budget funds).

13.      There is one important caveat to the principle that state-budget-funded programs
should replicate fully the practices of EU-funded instruments – in one word: capacity . In
truth, resources available to process applications and oversee projects are much lower in
departments responsible for state-budget-funded programs versus Managing Authorities of
EU structural funds (fewer staff, lower wages, etc.). Compared to the ROP, for instance, a
program like the PNDL is characterized by a larger portfolio of smaller investments (the
investments financed through the PNDL 2014 were on average three times smaller than
similar projects financed through the ROP 2007-2013 and the PNDR 2007-2013), which calls
for simpler yet equally rigorous procedures throughout the project cycle. Over 700 people
are involved in the management and implementation of the ROP, which also benefits from
a dedicated budget for technical assistance, whereby it can afford to also hire external
evaluators. The PNDL relies on only around 20 people in the MRDPA and has virtually no
budget allocated for hiring external consultants. This also means that a competitive grant
approach whereby beneficiaries across a region/across the country have to compete for
available funds is not feasible under the current PNDL’s capacity constraints. Equally
important, previous assessments of EU funds, including by the World Bank, 7 have noted
signs of excessive bureaucratization in how the Romanian Government implements EU
regulations, so it is important to adopt only elements that work well and err on the side of
simplicity.

14.      This final report recommends in chapters 4, 5, and 6 detailed sets of criteria for
prioritizing and selection projects in each of the following sectors: county and communal
roads; water and wastewater; and social infrastructure. The methodology deployed to
revamp the PNDL’s prioritization and selection criteria is straightforward: (i) estimate
investment needs in a particular sector (e.g., based on statistical data, available cost
standards, etc.); (ii) decide on a formula for allocating funds across counties; and (iii) decide
on a formula for selecting/ranking projects within a county; (iv) identify projects that can be
financed by EU funds and guide them to the relevant operational programme; and (v) arrive
at the final pool of projects proposed for PNDL financing. Of course, ongoing and new
investments are treated differently: the former should receive priority and new investments
should only be started if there are sufficient budgetary resources to cover their full costs
(not just in the first year, but in every year through completion).

15.     While each of sector calls for its own financing criteria to match its specificities,
there are multiple common categories that these criteria “test for.” The following are in
line with previous Bank proposals to the Government (as reflected in Emergency Ordinance
88/2013 for the prioritization of significant projects at the national level).
          First, the criteria proposed in this report test for actual needs on the ground and, by
           the same token, seek to estimate potential impact of proposed interventions, both
           in terms of numbers and in terms of quality of improvement. Potential measures

7
    See the reports on “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Coordination and Beneficiary Support,” World Bank, 2014




                                                                                                 6
    include: technical status (e.g., paved/unpaved road); demand (e.g., traffic levels,
    number of potential beneficiaries, level of development of a particular locality,
    number of inhabitants/physician, school-aged population, etc.); and opportunity
    (e.g., a road’s proximity to a major urban center).
   Second, the criteria test for strategic alignment of a proposed project with existing
    sectoral strategies: for example, for water and wastewater, the intervention should
    be included in the regional Water and Wastewater Master Plans.
   Third, the criteria also include a measure of financial sustainability. This seeks to
    correct the current issue of local authorities disregarding operations and
    maintenance (O&M) costs related to infrastructure projects financed by an EU grant
    or another form of support from the national government. The Financial
    Sustainability Indicator (FSI) looks at whether a local authority can afford to spend
    on operations and maintenance related to new infrastructure investments given
    their budgetary standing and trends.
   Fourth, to the extent possible, selection criteria should also factor in each projects’
    readiness level. As a general rule, the more advanced an investment in its
    implementation, the higher priority it should receive. The are important caveats to
    this, however: (i) some of the projects should not receive any more funding, despite
    the sunk costs, as they were poorly designed from the start (e.g., wastewater
    treatment plants in very small localities); and (ii) the data on project completion
    rates (as a proxy for “readiness”) are insufficient, unreliable, and variable over the
    course of a year (since the PNDL functions on an annual basis, a project may have
    one completion rate when funding is allocated, and another completion rate when
    funds actually make it to the beneficiary, as localities often fund projects from their
    own sources). Project readiness can be deployed by the MRDPA as a selection
    criterion – in addition to the criteria mentioned above – only after rationalizing the
    current project portfolio (i.e., eliminating all projects that should not receive any
    financing) and after developing a functioning system for data collection and analysis
    regarding project implementation status and completion rates.
   Fifth, proposed criteria under each sector seek to enable coordination of PNDL
    projects with other investments funded by the EU and/or the state budget . At a
    basic level, projects eligible for EU funds should be “redirected” from the PNDL
    pipeline to an EU operational programme (e.g., ROP, Large Infrastructure, National
    Rural Development Programme) by checking whether the proposed project has
    been submitted for nonreimbursable financing before granting PNDL funding.
    Moreover, for particular interventions, bonus points can be awarded in the scoring
    process if the applicant demonstrates coordination with other funding sources,
    other sectors, and other (local) governments.
   Finally, integrated planning should be encouraged by prioritizing projects included
    in an Integrated Development Strategy, following the model of the EU-funded ROP
    2007-2013 (with Integrated Development Plans under Axis 1) and of ROP 2014-
    2020 (with Integrated Urban Development Strategies – SIDU – under Axis 4).

16.      The MRDPA had access to a draft version of the criteria recommended by the
World Bank team in time to rethink the design of the PNDL for 2015, and Chapter 7
provides a review of the extent to which these proposals were already adopted. With
respect to the PNDL’s funding allocation by counties, by and large, the PNDL 2015 follows
the World Bank proposals, with some notable exceptions. 8 The key point is that the MRDPA
still needs to adopt a clearly defined, transparent formula for allocating funds between
counties. As for allocation by sectors, the 2015 split is closer to the Bank team’s proposals
than in the previous year. The MRDPA has triaged communal road projects, with a focus on
works with a high completion degree, based on interview data. Also, the program finances
more social infrastructure projects (particularly new educational infrastructure projects).

17.      The Bank team compared the 2015 PNDL portfolio with the priority lists resulting
from the application of criteria proposed in this report. Of the PNDL projects financed in
2015, about 46% (worth about half of the total allocation) were also on the Bank’s list. But
the program also financed 979 “non-priority” projects (i.e., in the initia l project portfolio of
around 4,000 interventions there were other proposals that should have received funding
before these 979 projects). Around 14% of PNDL 2015 represent investments in non-priority
sectors, i.e., sectors that, in the opinion of the World Bank, should not be the focus of the
PNDL. These include investments in tourism infrastructure, city hall buildings, communal
markets, or other hard infrastructure for which it is difficult to devise clear prioritization
criteria (e.g., investments in bridges and investments in local roads, usually determined on a
case-by-case basis like in the aftermath of a flood). Finally, there are also 367 investments
in the 2015 portfolio (roughly 15%) that should probably not be financed. These are
typically water and wastewater projects inherited from previous investment programs and
are either too small in scale (e.g., wastewater systems in localities with less than 2,000
people equivalent) or could be eligible for EU funds (e.g., Large Infrastructure OP).

Multiyear Budgeting
18.      The full adoption of multiyear budgeting in Romania holds great promise for
enhancing the coordination and impact of PNDL investments. The main advantages of a
multiannual PNDL would include: (i) strategic focus over a longer time horizon, meaning
more stable policy priorities; (ii) manageable project portfolios, in line with available
resources (i.e., no new projects can begin in the absence of required resources for the full
implementation period); (iii) enhanced predictability across the entire value chain, from the
MRDPA to program beneficiaries and project-level contractors; (iv) improved correlation
with current multiannual instruments (EU structural funds); and (v) simplified procedures
and reduced bureaucracy by signing truly multiannual contracts. Indeed, the successful
adoption of multiannual budgeting for investment programs like the PNDL requires a
substantial effort from many players, with the Center of Government and the Ministry of
Public Finance (MPF) playing leadership roles, though the MRDPA can act as a key driver of
needed reforms. Keeping in mind the need to triage and rationalize its large and

  For example, Botoș ani and Cluj received significantly less funds than what was proposed by the
Bank (around RON 11-12 million) less. By contrast, counties like Bistr ița-Năsăud, Constanța, and Iași
received significantly more – around 11-16 million RON more.




                                                                                                     8
unsustainable project portfolio, as well as the broader benefits of multiannual budgeting in
Romania, the MRDPA has the potential to become a key driver of needed reforms.

19.     It is also true that the culture of annual budgets is strong in Romania – partly
because of legal and regulatory limitations, partly because of mentalities, and partly
because of capacity reasons. The Constitution stipulates, under Article 138, paragraph 2,
that “the Government develops the draft of the budget annually […] and submits it for the
Parliament’s approval.” During field interviews, interlocutors in certain institutions,
including in the Ministry of Public Finance, have noted that this particular article is an
important constraint against adopting a full-fledged multiyear budgeting framework. In
practice, for an investment spanning multiple years such as a new bridge in a city, the City
Hall writes up a contract with the contractor and, annually, signs an addendum stipulating
the sums available for that given year. In addition, there are three key capacity constraints
worth noting: high unpredictability on the revenue side due to frequent changes in taxes
and unstable (and generally low) collection levels; weak ability of the Ministry of Public
Finance to provide sound economic and fiscal forecasts; and strongly fragmented,
rudimentary IT systems that makes it very hard to track programs and projects. 9

20.      On the question regarding the feasibility of a multiannual PNDL given current
legislative and policy constraints, there are more arguments in favor than against. For
one, EU-funded interventions currently “run through” the national budget and
expenditures get subsequently reimbursed; this suggests that it is possible to have
multiyear infrastructure investment projects even under the status quo constraints of
annual budgeting, provided that there is firm commitment to a clear annual budget
allocation. Moreover, the Romanian Law on Public Finances (Law 500/2002), even under its
current form, appears to permit multiyear budgeting. Article 4 (5) provides that the budget
may include “multiannual commitments, ” with these commitments defined by Article 2 (14)
as “amounts allocated to certain programs, projects, subprojects, objectives and the like,
which are carried on for a period longer than a year and give rise to commitment credits
and budgetary credits.” As for the annuality provision of the Romanian Constitution, there
is nothing stopping the Government or the Parliament from adhering to multiyear targets,
which is essentially what happens under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (though room for
improvement definitely exists). To follow the letter of the law, the Government would
develop and approve a multiyear budget annually, rolling it forward every year (as it
happens in other countries too).

21.     What should then be the key elements of a truly multiannual budgeting system

investment programs.

   The World Bank has an ongoing technical assistance project with the Ministry of Public Finance on
the topic of public investment management, including the prioritization of infrastructure projects at
the national level. Several of the key recommendations made in this report are adapted to the PNDL
and to investments at the subnational level from the “Draft Report on Strengthening the Link




                                                                                                   9
a particular investment has to only go to that investment; otherwise, the same problems
will continue: “drip funding,” delays, inefficient expenditures, and diverting money from
one investment to another. Second – and related to the first condition – is to have a solid
project monitoring system, tracking at all times what the projects’ total cost is, what
contracts are signed, and when. Third, the total value of multiannual appropriations for a
spending agency must be clearly and credibly defined. This would require the fiscal-
budgetary strategy (Law 69/2010) and the corresponding laws on approved ceilings to
define limits specifically for multiannual appropriations for each major ministry/spending
agency (this is not the case, currently). Under such a system, no new projects could be
pursued unless extra budgetary room becomes available for current and future years, equal
to the new projects’ total cost. It would thus be impossible to reshuffle projects within a
ministry’s portfolio (or program, like the PNDL), since each investment would have a clear,
dedicated multiannual appropriation. Last but not least, the system requires strong
monitoring and evaluation functions from both within and outside the MRDPA. The MPF
and other audit and control institutions like the Court of Accounts and the Audit Authority
should monitor project allocations and, respectively, corresponding expenditures, while the
Center of Government should regularly evaluate the performance of investment
programs. 11

22.      For its part, the MRDPA can take several steps to facilitate the full adoption of
multiannual budgeting in Romania. For one, the MRDPA should ask to be included in the
fiscal-budgetary strategy from 2016 onward. Currently, it is not one of the ten ministries
that is covered by this framework, which means that there is virtually no multiannual
financial planning and no ceilings defined for the main categories of expenditures (including
the PNDL). Moreover, the MRDPA should work with the MPF to promote the establishment
of ceilings and multiannual appropriations for baseline capital expenditures (for the current
project portfolio) and new investment projects. Again, the current system does not make
this distinction, which is critical for having a functional model of strategic prioritization of a
limited number of projects.

23.   More specific to the PNDL, the MRDPA should consider pursuing the following
measures for turning the program into a de facto multiannual instrument:
       Conceptualize what the PNDL could look like through 2020 – essentially the time
        interval matching the EU programming period. This is a first step to greater internal
        discipline in allocating resources to PNDL projects and, in fact, does not depend on
        the Ministry of Finance formally adopting the model presented above. All that is
        needed is sufficient commitment by the MRDPA to stick to a certain split in the
        funding allocated to the main sectors under the PNDL. Assuming the PNDL budget

         will be at least at 2014 levels, the total envelope through 2020 would be RON 13
         billion RON – or EUR 2.8 billion. 12
        Next, the MRDPA should rationalize the PNDL portfolio based on budget constraints.
         The current portfolio would take over 15 years to complete, assuming that 2014
         funding levels would hold going forward. The rationalization should therefore be
         done for each sector by: (i) deploying the sector-specific criteria (e.g., those listed in
         chapters 4-6 of the current report); and (ii) considering project completion status,
         with more advanced works taking priority. Some investments will have to be put on
         hold, others will have to search for alternative funding (e.g., EU funds), and others
         will have to be canceled.
        The MRDPA should further set the PNDL baseline (for the budgeted year and for the
         programming period). This would cover all ongoing investments that passed the
         test (i.e., remained in the portfolio) in the previous step. All these projects should
         be finalized according to their implementation timeline (without intervening on the
         portfolio of ongoing investments to exclude some projects and/or introduce new
         ones), budgeting properly based on costs expected for each year.
        The MRDPA should consider new investments separately from ongoing projects and
         only when allowed by the available budget envelope. New investment projects
         should be funded exclusively by the difference between the total PNDL budgetary
         allocation (budgeted year and programming period) and the PNDL baseline (as
         defined above). These projects would be prioritized according to the sector-specific
         criteria in this report. For all new projects accepted, the corresponding planned
         budget allocations must be included in the PNDL baseline for future years.

        The MRDPA should develop its IT systems for tracking how projects are performing.
         This is needed to monitor the large number of projects in the PNDL portfolio and
         know, at all times, which stage they are at, how much money they are absorbing,
         and whether they are on track or face delays. The same database would also
         capture the multiannual requirements of each project in the portfolio, making sure
         that the total costs are properly reflected in the available budgetary envelope.
        The MRDPA should strengthen overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
         mechanisms to make necessary corrections in the financing and implementation of
         the program promptly. The PNDL should have performance indicators for the entire
         program (e.g., number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and
         for each sector (length of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with
         access to water and sanitation, etc.). This would enable measuring actual results, in
         line with the principles of performance-based budgeting (the most advanced form
         of multiannual budgeting, virtually nonexistent in Romania). The MRDPA should
         also rely on third parties for unbiased evaluations of the PNDL’s efficiency and
         effectiveness, both during and post implementation.

  See the report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” (submitted by the World
Bank team as part of the same technical assistance for the MRDPA – Component 2) for an in-depth

                                                                                               11
Territorial Contracts
24.      Based on the experience of other countries, territorial contracts (TCs) between
national and sub-national entities hold the potential to become a very powerful tool for
the coordination of investments in Romania . At the same time, it is important to recognize
that adoption of TCs would be much harder than adoption of multiyear budgeting, for
which a starting point (albeit insufficient) does exist. TCs involve stakeholders from public,
private, and nonprofit sectors, usually at a regional level. They include a vision for that
particular territory, with goals, activities (projects), and performance indicators (for output,
outcome, and impact). They can be transactional, shaping financial allocations through a
series of positive incentives and/or sanctions; or relational, trust-based. Most importantly,
territorial contracts have the potential to account for both state-budget and EU funds,
setting priority projects and “dividing them up” between financing sources of various kinds .

25.      In the Romanian context, territorial contracts would help mitigate the high
volatility of strategic investment priorities. First, territorial contracts would offer an
opportunity to bring stakeholders together – across party lines and across sectors (public,
private, and nonprofit) – and establish a list of priority projects for an entire programming
period. Second, they would be perceived as stronger accountability mechanisms compared
to existing documents (e.g., development strategies). They could have specific sanctions for
potential breaches, penalizing those parties that decide to deviate unilaterally from set
priorities. Third, territorial contracts would follow a clear format, requiring subnational and
national authorities to think through a list of priority projects, but also decide early on
regarding funding sources and parties accountable for implementation. This framework
would help define, from the start, who is responsible for what. Fourth, by setting a more
stable list of priorities, territorial contracts would reduce the risk of “drip funding” and
starting more projects than financially sustainable. Finally, this tool would enable
authorities across administrative levels to nurture a culture based on partnership and
collaboration, which is very valuable in a context where ever-more-complex projects
require public actors to be increasingly creative and collaborative – not just across
administrative levels, but also across sectors.

26.     In addition to strong political commitment, several key principles should be
followed for an effective deployment of TCs in the current Romanian context and, in fact,
several of these recommendations hold regardless of whether TCs ultimately materialize .
The first is to integrate – not duplicate – existing planning documents at all relevant
administrative levels (development strategies, spatial plans, programming documents for
EU and state-budget funds, national sectoral strategies, etc.). Ideally, Romania should also
should have a specific legislation regulating TCs, either as a new law on (regional)
development (per the Polish model of the 2006 Act the principles of development policy) or
as an amendment to the Law on Public Administration as to allow signing and enforcing
agreements between national and sub-national authorities. Moreover, if one party
breaches the TCs, there need to be clear sanctions, while on the positive side projects
included in a TC could be rewarded with bonus points during evaluation processes (whether
under EU or state-budget-funded programs) or, in the aggregate, regions that manage to
maintain the same TC priorities for an entire programming period may receive additional
transfers from the national budget. To the full extent possible, the TCs should have the



                                                                                            12
same timeline as EU funds (i.e., seven plus two-three years) and state-budget funds should
also be able to operate in a multiannual framework.

27.   The MRDPA, as the ministry in charge with public administration affairs in
Romania, should take on the main role in the adoption of TCs and in creating the
aforementioned conditions for their success. Specific steps would include:
       Create a technical task team responsible for evaluating in-depth the opportunity of
        adopting territorial contracts in Romania. This internal team could also collaborate
        with outside experts from other Member States and IFIs.

       Assemble a group of legal experts and explore requirements, needed changes, etc.
        This is important to determine what can be done under the current legal framework
        and what changes are needed, if any. It would be particularly critical to establish
        the type of sanctions and positive rewards that could be tied to the adoption of
        territorial contracts.

       Launch a consultation process with subnational governments to test the idea and
        decide on the optimal structure . This could be done through a series of events in
        each region, enlisting the help of Regional Development Agencies. Of particular
        important would be to decide who the parties to the agreement could be: for
        example, the MRDPA and county councils, or the MRDPA and Regional
        Development Councils (i.e., the body that includes county and local authorities in a
        particular region), etc.

       Prepare a full action plan and timeline for implementation . This will depend on
        generating sufficient momentum and buy-in from all stakeholders involved.

       Launch pilot territorial contracts in a number of jurisdictions.

       Monitor and evaluate pilot results and adapt, launch, and implement the model for
        the national scale. External experts should be involved to assess the results of TCs,
        covering a series of critical areas: legal; technical; policy design; and monitoring and
        evaluation (M&E).


Next Steps
28.      As noted in the introductory chapter below, this final report is submitted along
with Investment Guides for county roads, water and wastewater, and local-level
infrastructure (communal roads and social infrastructure) . These additional outputs
include: an introductory section; sectoral overviews (investment needs and coordination
principles); a set of proposed criteria; and a visual prioritization of potential investments
based on those criteria. Because these guides are meant to be standalone, ready-to-use,
and practical prioritization tools, the first three parts (introduction, sector overview, and
proposed criteria) match various sections of the current report. The final part, however, is
entirely new: an atlas of prioritized investments at the level of each county/region. This is
meant to provide a quick reference guide for both subnational authorities (potential
beneficiaries) that are seeking to apply for EU and/or state-budget funding, and for national



                                                                                            13
Managing Authorities of different investment programs that make financing decisions. Put
differently, the guides answer in a dual top-down/bottom-up approach the key question of
where limited resources should go, in a coordinated manner, to maximize impact.

29.     In the following months, the findings of both the current final report and of the
Investment Guides will be disseminated at the local and regional level through a series of
workshops. In line with the provisions of the Advisory Agreement between the World Bank
and the MRDPA, these activities will be organized in the fall of 2015 and will cover all eight
regions in Romania. Targeted audience members will include: staff of the PNDL and of
various operational programs; local/county authorities, as potential and actual beneficiaries
of EU and state-budget financing for infrastructure projects; staff of Regional Development
Agencies (RDAs); experts from civil society and the academia; private-sector
representatives; and other stakeholders. At one level, it is hoped that participants to these
workshops will make informed decisions in the 2014-2020 programming period, choosing to
submit impactful projects for financing and coordinating their efforts better. Equally
important, their direct feedback can help refine current findings and recommendations.

30.     With respect to the timing of this report, it is critical to note that some key
aspects of EU-funded programs for 2014-2020 are still work in progress as of July 2015.
While programming documents have been validated, by and large, by the European
Commission, various line ministries in charge of the future operational programs still need
to approve final versions of Applicant Guides. These guides go into the specifics of different
financing axes, defining eligibility and financing criteria. As such, the current final report and
the investment guides submitted together with this output may require some adjustment
upon the publishing of final versions for the Applicant Guides. To the extent possible given
time and resource constraints, the Bank team may make the necessary changes over the
coming months to reflect the latest information available.

31.      Finally, in parallel with the aforementioned knowledge dissemination activities,
the Bank team looks forward to working with MRDPA counterparts in advancing the
recommendations made in this report. These include adopting a new set of financing
criteria for the PNDL specifically, as proposed here, as the result of extensive consultations
with the MRDPA and other key stakeholders (local/county authorities, Regional
Development Agencies, other ministries, etc.). To enhance transparency and encourage a
wider debate on the methodology presented in this report, the MRDPA should consider
publishing the recommendations and the results of applying the criteria to the current
PNDL portfolio and beyond, at the level of each county. The aforementioned Investment
Guides would provide an accessible and easy-to-use platform for debating which projects
could be prioritized and which sources of funding could be leveraged by local/county
authorities. It is critical to note that the MRDPA should take ultimate ownership over
proposed evaluation and selection criteria, as well as over other potential reforms like
multiannual budgeting and territorial contracts. The Bank team stands ready to provide
further guidance on all these aspects, noting that their adoption and implementation
depends on the MRDPA and on other key stakeholders that the ministry should engage
directly.

Introduction
32.      The World Bank has agreed to support the Government of Romania (GoR) with
the harmonization of public investments financed by the European Union and the state
budget, with the wider aim of promoting the country’s sustainable and inclusive growth .
This work is a follow-up to the World Bank’s Regional Development Program in Romania
(November 2012-March 2014), which provided recommendations primarily targeted at EU-
funded instruments. In turn, the current engagement seeks to encourage effective
coordination among all types of funding sources for a variety of local infrastructure
investments. Overall, stronger development impact will result from reducing inefficiencies
and leveraging synergies across projects. The current technical assistance with the Ministry
of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) includes four components, as
follows:
      Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
       state-funded investments in infrastructure;
      Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
       projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of
       potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020 programming period;
      Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
       technologies in investments overseen by the MRDPA;
      Component 4 – Assistance with the design of a Housing and Infrastructure
       Development Strategy.

33.    This Final Report corresponds to the first component mentioned above – i.e.,
support for the correlation and coordination of strategies and plans for EU and state-
funded infrastructure investments . This component in turn includes two sub-activities:
            a. Analysis of infrastructure investment strategies, including ways to improve
               their coordination and correlation;
            b. Harmonized selection criteria for enhanced coordination between EU and
               State-funded projects.

The current work covers the latter sub-component (in italics), making a set of specific
proposals for selection criteria that facilitate the proper coordination of projects financed
by the state budget and, respectively, by EU structural funds. The focus of this work is on
the National Local Development Program (PNDL), the main state-budget-funded investment
program for local infrastructure development, though findings and recommendations may
be extrapolated to other state-budget-funded instruments (e.g., the Environment Fund). In
particular, this assessment covers the following types of public investments: county roads;
communal roads; water infrastructure; wastewater infrastructure; and social infrastructure
(in the education, health, culture, and sports sectors).

34.    There are strong linkages between this final report and the Bank’s broader
ongoing technical assistance for “Harmonizing State and EU -Funded Projects in Romania’s
Regions.” In parallel, the Bank team has submitted intermediary and final reports on


                                                                                         15
“Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State -Funded Investments in
Romania’s Infrastructure” (also under Component 1). The outputs under this component
cover a set of key common aspects, in accordance with the Advisory Services Agreement
between the Bank and the MRDPA, also reflected in the current report:
     State-funded interventions carried out under the supervision of the Directorate
       General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) under the MRDPA,
       primarily through the National Local Development Program (PNDL) since 2012 and
       other programs (before 2012);
       State-budget-funded interventions carried out by other ministries (e.g., the
        Environment Fund under the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change); and
       EU-funded instruments supporting infrastructure investments in relevant sectors,
        most notably the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013 and 2014-
        2020, the National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013 and 2014-
        2020, the Sectoral Operational Programme Environment (SOP Environment) 2007-
        2013, and the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LI OP) 2014-2020.
Beyond these commonalities, the current report focuses only on selection criteria as one
tool to ensure coordination, while the other output reviews a much broader set of
instruments that serve a similar purpose.

35.      This work is also correlated with findings and recommendations from other
components of the current engagement with the MRDPA. In particular, the final report on
“Improved Prioritization Criteria for the PNDL” (under Component 2), submitted in
December 2014, provides a list of proposed criteria for the enhanced selection of state-
budget-funded investments in county and local roads, water and wastewater, and social
infrastructure. This report proposes some updates to those criteria based on two
considerations: (i) recent data have become available in the meantime (e.g., emerging
priorities for EU operational programmes for 2014-2020); and (ii) financing criteria can
facilitate enhanced coordination – an aim specific to the current report (and to Component
1). In addition, this final report covers two additional topics that would help enable
coordination in the Romanian context: multiannual budgeting and territorial contracts. The
MRDPA, as the primary audience of this technical assistance, has expressed interest in both
instruments and their potential adaptation to the Romanian context generally and to PNDL
specifically.

36.      In short, this report is about practical ways for enhancing coordination across
investment programs – particularly across the PNDL and corresponding EU-funded
instruments – through improved criteria for optimal prioritization and selection. The
current analysis goes a significant step beyond simply formulating criteria that could
theoretically be applied to PNDL projects; indeed, it applies the set of proposed criteria to
the potential investments in county and local roads, water and wastewater systems, and
social infrastructure. The results are presented in the following chapters and in a set of
atlases, with a series of maps that are meant to assist local, county, and national
stakeholders in prioritizing public infrastructure investments at the county level. The atlases
are submitted separately to the MRDPA, in electronic form only. It is hoped that these can
serve as useful tools for both managing authorities and beneficiaries of EU and state-



                                                                                           16
budget-funded programs as they define investment priorities for the 2014-2020
programming period.


Context
37.     The context for this report is the same as for the Bank’s overall technical
assistance to the MRDPA: essentially, Romania faces a critical need to enhance
coordination of investment projects in order to “do more with less.” The country today
displays a complex picture of great hopes and remarkable development potential, in the
context of persistent challenges in many vital sectors. It is beyond any doubt Romania still
has a long way to go in terms of providing its citizens – all citizens, including the poor and
the marginalized – the infrastructure and public services they need to share and add to the
benefits of development. Examples of gaps abound and are hard to miss (e.g., deficient
transport infrastructure, lack of access to water and sanitation in certain rural areas,
governance challenges, etc.), particularly in comparison to the situation in other EU
Member States. But it is also true that Romania has taken important steps toward
sustainable and inclusive growth in recent years. Positive results, particularly in large urban
centers – with Bucharest surpassing cities like Madrid, Lisbon, and Athens in terms of GDP
per capita (PPP)13 – demonstrate Romania’s growth potential. If citizens become truly
enabled to pursue opportunities and maximize their productivity, there are strong
prospects for the country’s sustainable and inclusive development .

38.      The World Bank’s 2013 “Competitive Cities” report argues that the key to
unlocking Romania’s growth potential involves interventions customized to the needs of
leading and lagging areas. The first priority is to invest in improved connectivity and
accessibility (both within leading areas and between leading and lagging regions), enabling
people to take advantage of opportunities in Romania and abroad. Second, particularly in
lagging areas, the government should invest in functioning institutions that ensure basic
living standards for communities – essentially, the same start in life for all citizens
(including running water, sewage, electricity, good schooling, effective land and housing
markets, healthcare, etc.). Finally, marginalized communities require targeted efforts to
address the specific obstacles they face (e.g., discrimination, exclusion, etc.). The chart
below is a snapshot of recommended types of interventions for leading and lagging areas.

39.      The basic condition for addressing Romania’s development needs – required,
though not sufficient – is access to financial resources for critical investments. In
particular, infrastructure projects like roads and water and sewage networks are typically
very costly and complex, putting a significant strain on local, county, and national budgets.
Because of strict targets with respect to annual budget deficits, Romania does not have
much leeway to expand significantly infrastructure development programs from its own
budget sources. In this context, non-reimbursable funds from the European Union (EU),
amounting to around EUR 40 billion for the 2014-2020 programming period, are an
essential source of investment money. But past experience suggest that Romania faces
significant constraints that have limited its capacity to absorb such funds, for a variety of

       reasons: incomplete alignment with EU legislation and best practices, particularly in the
       area of public procurement; lack of resources for co-financing and running costs of EU-
       funded projects; local public authorities’ weak capacity to prepare, implement, monitor,
       and evaluate complex interventions; heavy bureaucracy and excessive audits, etc. 14 As of
       January 31, 2015, Romania’s absorption rate – despite significant progress made in 2013
       and 2014 – remained the lowest in the EU at 51.87%.

       40.      The need for infrastructure investments in Romania is considerable and the
       corresponding costs far exceed what EU funds alone can cover, even if the government
       was successful at driving the absorption close to 100%. For example, by 2018, around EUR
       20 billion need to be invested in the water and wastewater infrastructure to increase the
       share of Romanians with access to such infrastructure to at least 70% (from 52% in 2004),
       in line with Romania’s commitments made through the EU Accession Agreement upon
       joining in 2007. However, only around EUR 3.3 billion have been allocated for such
       investments under SOP Environment 2007-2013.

41.      While the causes for current challenges may be complex, the overall message is
simple: Romania faces significant development needs but has limited financial resources,
making value for money a principle of paramount importance for its public investments.
The government should pursue an agenda focused on maximizing impact for the given
funding available for investment programs, from the EU and/or from the state budget. In
this endeavor, it is critical to ensure that investment funding is allocated based on clear,
fair, and effective selection criteria and goes toward interventions that are designed and
implemented in a coordinated fashion. If such principles and procedures are largely upheld
in the disbursement of EU funds, including through the Regional Operational Programme
(ROP), 15 state-budget-funded interventions have shown weaknesses in the past.

42.    This is where the issue of coordination of public investments comes into play –
and, hence, the coordination of criteria for selecting projects becomes a key ingredient to
maximizing the development impact of every leu, euro, or dollar spent on infrastructure.
The current lack of coordination means that EU and state-budget-funded investment
programs overlap and often “compete” for the same pool of beneficiaries. This issue is not
new to the current Romanian context. The 2011 World Bank Functional Review of
Romania’s regional development sector recommended that programs funded 100% from
the state budget “[should] avoid duplication with EU -supported [interventions].” 16 The
example below is included as a cautionary tale of what can happen when investment
programs and their criteria are not properly coordinated.
         Box 1. The PNDI showed clear gaps in coordination with EU funds

          The now-defunct National Program for Infrastructure Development (PNDI) , a EUR 4
          billion program supported by the GOR, could have effectively crowded out EU-funded
          structural instruments like the ROP, OP Environment, and the National Rural
          Development Programme (PNDR). First, the PNDI targeted similar types of infrastructure
          investments (e.g., county roads, water and sewage networks, etc.). Second, it lacked
          rigorous and transparent selection processes, and staff in the then Ministry of Regional
          Development and Tourism (MRDT) became quickly overwhelmed with funding requests
          and technical documentations (e.g., prefeasibility and feasibili ty studies, detailed
          technical designs, etc.) submitted by public beneficiaries from across the country. There
          was no system for the independent assessment of projects (unlike the requirement to
          have external evaluators of EU-funded projects) and a programming document defining
          financing criteria was completely lacking (unlike the extensive programming documents
          corresponding to EU-funds, which are prepared by different OPs and approved by the
          European Commission). In the absence of clear selection criteria and prioritization
          measures, the state-budget-funded PNDI project portfolio expanded quickly. The change
          in government of July 2012 brought the PNDI to a complete halt, in recognition of the
          multiple issues that were plaguing the program.


43.    Several insights are worth highlighting at this point. First, Romania has to address
the gap between supply/funding and demand/need of public investments quickly and

effectively. Second, this requires increased coordination of public infrastructure
investments. Third, the criteria that shape the prioritization and selection of projects to be
financed play a critical role in enhancing/hindering coordination efforts. It follows that
decision-makers should carefully design, implement, and review the criteria applicable to
programs that support investments in infrastructure. This report seeks to help in that
effort, primarily through actions that the MRDPA can lead directly, but also with a series of
recommendations targeting other stakeholders. The chart below summarizes the potential
role of key actors involved.

Objective, Scope, and Methodology
44.    The main objective of the Bank’s overall engagement with the MRDPA is to
support the strategic coordination of infrastructure strategies and investment projects
financed by the EU and by the state budget in regions, counties, and municipalities. This
hopes to contribute to ensuring a coherent, integrated, and impactful approach to public
investment management, and to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of spending EU
and state-budget funds for the 2014-2020 programming period. Optimal prioritization of
investments is critical in this endeavor.




                                                                                                                                                                  20
45.      The current report aims to facilitate the adoption of prioritization and selection
criteria that enhance coordination at the level of infrastructure programs and at the level
of the projects they finance. This is a fundamental precondition for ensuring harmonized
infrastructure investments: in the absence of optimal criteria, as is typically the case with
current state-budget-funded programs in Romania, investments may overlap, generating
inefficiencies, or they may fail to exploit potential synergies. If the desired outcome is to
“do more with less” and therefore accelerate inclusive and sustainabl e development,
decision makers should give proper thought to the need for ensuring coordination and to
choosing financing criteria that are harmonized across different sources of investment
funding.

46.      In addition to enhancing coordination, harmonized criteria hold the promise of
ensuring a more rigorous design and implementation of investment programs and
greater “interoperability” across financing sources. Especially in comparison to EU funds, a
core issue that has plagued state-budget-funded instruments is the lack of clarity and rigor
in selecting investments. The general perception is that such programs are like a “black
box” that leaves potential applicants and other stakeholders wondering how particular
projects receive funding to the detriment of others. By adopting a set of clear, coordinated
criteria and a transparent methodology for applying them to a portfolio of new and
ongoing proposed investments, state-budget-funded programs like the PNDL would boost
their impact and credibility among interested applicants. While more projects would come
through the pipeline, there would actually be less room to question decisions regarding
funding allocations, as these would be grounded in a defined and more objective
methodology. This is the intent of this report, along with contributing to the harmonization
of procedures across EU and state-budget-funded programs, which can also contribute to
maximizing absorption of EU funds. If investments follow the same rules, a pipeline of
projects can be created with state budget funding and then transferred to EU-funded
programs, as needed/as feasible.

47.      A related goal for the current report is to determine appropriate sources of
funding for various project proposals, with the hope of turning projects in the MRDPA ’s
pipeline into EU-funded investments for 2014-2020. Currently, PNDL management and
staff, county councils, and local authorities applying for funding do not have clear,
institutionalized mechanisms for determining whether a certain proposed investment
should apply for EU or state-budget funding. Criteria for the PNDL should take into account
first whether proposed projects could receive funding from an EU-funded program for the
2014-2020 programming period. As argued above, this would both help improve absorption
rates of non-reimbursable funds (as of May 31, 2015, Romania is still the poorest performer
in this respect for the 2007-2013 programming period) and allow limited state-budget
resources to go to areas and projects where they are truly needed.

48.    In addition, this final report includes two “bonus” chapters on coordination
mechanisms that were considered worthy of further exploration: multiannual budgeting
and territorial contracts. The former would allow a program like the PNDL to function on a
multiyear framework, much like EU-funded programs, which would enhance predictability
and enable the government to finish projects in a reasonable time horizon. Territorial
contracts between sub-national and national authorities are currently used in other EU



                                                                                          21
member states to ensure a more stable implementation framework for investment
programs, across all types of financing sources (EU and state budget). This would also help
define a more stable list of strategic projects – and set aside corresponding funding. The
goal would be to make sure that investments are properly selected and, once started,
timely completed, regardless of potential political changes (in the past, such shifts have led
to different priorities and new projects started to the detriment of ongoing investments).

Figure 3. This report focuses on a number of critical coordination mechanisms




49.      The main scope of the current assessment focuses on defining improved criteria
for harmonized infrastructure projects. As explained in the next chapter of this report,
coordination is a multifaceted concept. It may be applied to several dimensions: sector
(e.g., within a sector or between sectors); administrative level (e.g., between local,
regional, and national levels); phase of a program (e.g., strategy/plan, investment program,
and/or individual project); phase of an investment (planning, implementation, and post-
implementation); and type (policy, financial, technical, legal, etc.). The final report on
“Coordination of Strategies and Progra ms for EU and State-Funded Investments in
Romania’s Infrastructure, ” submitted in April 2015, discusses all these various dimensions
in depth. The current analysis, however, has a more narrow focus – namely on financing
criteria, which in the specialized literature fit under the category of “conditionalities” in the
typology of coordination mechanisms, as they impose certain requirements for how funds
can be accessed by eligible interested applicants (e.g., local public authorities).




                                                                                              22
50.      This report presents a systematic way of prioritizing and selecting potential
investments in county and communal roads, water, wastewater, and social
infrastructure. These are the key sectors targeted by the National Local Development
Program (PNDL), the most important state-budget-funded instrument for supporting local
infrastructure investments. A defined set of investments is covered under each of the three
aforementioned sectors, in line with what the PNDL finances. For example, the program
funds mainly water supply and wastewater management projects, with a range of other
investments (e.g., flood management, environmental protection, recreational uses/
tourism, etc.) targeted by other instruments like the Environment Fund. Similarly, social
infrastructure may include a wide array of options, but in the context of the PNDL it covers
mainly schools, health centers, sport centers, and cultural buildings.

51.     While this report focuses primarily on the PNDL specifically, as requested by the
main client of the work, the set of proposed criteria and the corresponding methodology
may be applied beyond the PNDL. For instance, state-budget-funded programs (e.g., the
Environment Fund, the programs for upgrading school infrastructure, etc.) could follow the
same recommendations. The criteria and procedures of EU structural funds for 2014-2020
inform this analysis, to the extent that such data are available at the time of this report’s
submission. Because Applicant Guides for EU-funded programs are still work in progress,
some of the findings may need to be adjusted once the 2014-2020 framework is fully
defined. Nonetheless, it is hoped that this analysis supports Managing Authorities,
Intermediate Bodies, and other stakeholders currently involved in finalizing the criteria
applicable to EU-funded instruments. 17

52.    Several related reports under the same Bank technical assistance for the MRDPA
inform and correlate with this study, as follows :
        Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
         state-funded investments in infrastructure;
             o The Final Report on “Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and
                 State-Funded Investments in Romania’s Infrastructure,” submitted in April
                 2015, addresses the issue of coordination from multiple perspectives, as
                 noted above. It focuses on coordinating strategies and investment
                 programs, at all levels (supranational, national, and subnational). It also
                 covers the four dimensions it defines for an “enabling environment” for
                 coordination: trust, accountability, capacity, and information flows. 18
        Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
         projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of
         potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020 programming period;
             o The final report on “Prioritization Criteria for Improved PNDL Projects,”

   As of early March 2015, programmatic documents for 2014-2020 EU funds in Romania are only in

               proposed improvements. The report also put forth a set of criteria for the
               prioritization and selection of investments in the key sectors targeted by
               the PNDL. These are the starting point for the current final report.
      Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
       technologies in investments overseen by the MRDPA;
           o This final report, submitted in June 2015, suggests improved technologies
              that may also help with the coordination of projects during the
              implementation phase. The choice of superior technologies (e.g., with
              lower operations and maintenance costs upon project completion) can be
              encouraged/rewarded through specific criteria.

53.    This report draws on observations and recommendations from extensive desk
research and over 100 field interviews conducted from June 2014 through May 2015. The
main sources of data and the key documents reviewed include the following:
      2013-2016 Governing Program, which defines the current cabinet’s priorities across
       and within key development sectors in Romania.
      Legal framework for the PNDL’s implementation, including the text of the ordinance
       establishing the program, implementation norms, eligibility and selection criteria,
       and application templates. Other legislative provisions related to the
       implementation of EU and state-funded investment programs have been
       considered.
      Programmatic documents and applicant guides corresponding to EU-funded
       instruments for 2007-2013 (e.g., the Regional Operational Programme - ROP, the

       Programme etc.) and for 2014-2020 (only in draft form as of mid-March 2015).
      Regional Master Plans for Water and Wastewater for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020
       (only in draft form as of mid-March 2015), with a particular focus on proposed
       selection and prioritization criteria.
      Regional Development Plans prepared for 2007-2013 (in final form) and for 2014-
       2020 (in draft form), for each of Romania’s eight development regions.
      Interviews with key stakeholders at the local, regional, and national level.
      Database of projects financed under the 2014 PNDL .
      Database of EU-funded infrastructure programs managed by the MRDPA, i.e., the
       ROP 2007-2013.
      Database of public infrastructure projects managed by other Ministries , including
       the Ministry of Environment through OP Environment 2007-2013 and the Ministry
       of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) through the National Rural
       Development Program (PNDR). This was provided in draft form by the MRDPA.

54.   In addition, this report ’s findings and recommendations correlate with other
ongoing and completed technical assistance work, as follows:
      The 2011 Functional Review of the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism
       (now the MRDPA), which called early on for enhanced harmonization across state-
       budget and EU-funded investment programs.
      Competitive Cities: Reshaping the Economic Geography of Romania (World Bank,
       2013), delivered as part of the World Bank Romania Regional Development
       Program, which lays out a vision for the country’s sustainable and inclusive growth,
       including key policy priorities for leading and lagging areas.
      ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Communication and Beneficiary Support
       Mechanisms for the Regional Operational Programme, 2014-2020 (World Bank,
       2014) includes two reports that discuss the regional framework for planning and
       implementing public infrastructure investments, particularly through the Regional
       Operational Programme (ROP). The reports include an assessment of Regional
       Development Agencies (RDAs) and offer recommendations for support
       mechanisms to local and county-level applicants and beneficiaries of EU funds,
       including assistance for improved coordination of investments.
      Enhanced Spatial Planning (World Bank, 2013) evaluates the spatial planning
       framework in Romania and recommends solutions for enhancing coordination
       among lower and higher-level plans.
      Strategic IDPs Assessment (World Bank, 2013) is an in-depth review of 2007-2013
       Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) in growth poles around Romania. IDPs are key
       tools for facilitating integrated planning at the level of localities. The study
       summarizes current gaps and proposes measures for improving the quality of such
       documents, and also assesses the role of Growth Pole Coordinators.
      Harmonizing Strategic Planning and Budgetary Programming in Romania (2015)
       reviews the national framework for developing, approving, and implementing
       strategies. The study is related to the potential establishment of a Strategy Unit
       (SU) at the Center of Government in Romania, a key proposal for ensuring
       coordination among strategies.
      World Bank reports on CLLD and ITI Danube Delta make a number of
       recommendations for facilitating integrated planning and project implementation
       through these two new instruments promoted by the EU for 2014-2020.

       Governments, which explores solutions for incentivizing the local level to mobilize
       and commit resources effectively, including through the mobilization of greater
       local resources (e.g., one candidate for increasing the share of local revenues is the
       property tax).

Audiences
55.     The primary audience of the current report is the staff of the Directorate General
for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) within the Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration, which manages the PNDL. The report puts forth a
proposal for how PNDL investments could be better coordinated with investments made
through other national programs, particularly EU-funded programs, through improved
financing criteria.

56.    Other stakeholders who may benefit from this assessment include:
               At the national level:
                           Ministries and agencies in charge of planning and
                            implementing state-budget-funded investment programs
                            (e.g., the Ministry of Environment for the Environment
                            Fund);
                           Managing Authorities and Intermediate Bodies of EU-
                            funded operational programmes for 2014-2020, particularly
                            for infrastructure projects (the MRDPA, which manages the
                            Regional Operational Programme, the Ministry of European
                            Funds, which manages the Large Infrastructure Programme,
                            and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,
                            which manages the National Rural Development
                            Programme).

                  At the regional level: Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), which are
                   in charge of regional-level planning and coordination (through the
                   Regional Development Plans developed for each programming period)
                   and also serve as IBs for the Regional Operational Programme (ROP)
                   2014-2020;

                  At the county and local level: local communities and, more specifically,
                   public authorities (Local Councils, County Councils, Intercommunity
                   Development Associations), which prepare projects and submit
                   applications to various EU and state-funded programs (including
                   technical staff responsible for working with technical designers and
                   other consultants).

                  Finally, for its part, the European Commission (EC) may benefit from this
                   study’s findings and replicate recommendations in other Member
                   States. Certainly, the issue of effective coordination and harmonization
                   of criteria across EU and state-funded programs is relevant beyond the
                   Romanian context.

Report Structure
57.      Following this introduction, this final report is structured into eight distinct
chapters. The first chapter makes the case for enhanced coordination of public
infrastructure investments in Romania. Chapter 2 looks at current financing criteria
corresponding to the various programs that support public infrastructure projects at the
local/county/regional level. Chapter 3 discusses key preconditions to a solid foundation for
coordinating public investments. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 focus squarely on financing criteria
and ways to harmonize them better in the roads, water, wastewater, and social
infrastructure sectors. Chapter 7 assesses the PNDL 2015 based on the latest available data
from the MRDPA, taking into account the MRDPA’s decisions on funding allocation and
project prioritization compared to recommendations previously made by the Bank team.
Finally, chapters 8 and 9 focus on two instruments that could prove particularly useful to
the MRDPA in the effort to improve the functioning of the PNDL: multiannual budgeting
and territorial contracts.

58.       The detailed report structure is as follows:
         Chapter 1: The Case for Coordinating Public Infrastructure Investments
             o The starting point is an economic argument for financing infrastructure
                 investment programs based on the results of an Input-Output analysis –
                 specifically applied to the PNDL as part of this report.
             o This chapter also reviews the main concepts of the current assessment:
                 coordination, prioritization, and selection of infrastructure investments.
             o It summarizes the different types of coordination and discusses two
                 approaches to the harmonization of financing criteria: equivalence and
                 complementarity.
              o The same chapter presents the overall categories to be considered for the
                development of enhanced financing criteria (e.g., project relevance,
                applicant’s capacity, etc.).

         Chapter 2: Diagnostic of Current Financing Criteria as Coordination Tools
             o This chapter provides a brief diagnostic of the status quo, evaluating
                 current coordination efforts among and across EU operational programmes
                 and state-budget-funded investment programs.
             o Findings cover the PNDL and include two good practice examples from the
                 education sector in Romania.

         Chapter 3: Building a Strong Foundation for Harmonized Criteria and Enhanced
          Coordination
             o Before looking at criteria per se, this report discusses several preconditions
                 for the effective coordination of infrastructure investments.
             o Even with fully coherent, harmonized financing criteria, investments may
                 still show gaps in coordination unless they follow common rules and
                 procedures in the design and implementation phases.

        o The topics addressed include: a standard programming period; clear project
          implementation timeline; multiannual budget, etc.

   Chapters 4, 5, and 6: Recommendations on Improved Financing Criteria for
    Enhanced Coordination of Public Investments
       o These chapters assess investment needs, review coordination issues, and
           propose recommendations.
        o Each chapter is dedicated to one of the three main sectors: roads; water
          and wastewater; and social infrastructure.

   Chapter 7: From Theory to Practice: The PNDL 2015
       o This chapter evaluates several key features of the PNDL 2015, based on
           data made available by the MRDPA.
        o Topics covered include: budget allocation by counties; funding allocation by
          priorities; and prioritization at the project level. Actual outcomes are
          compared to the framework proposed in previous chapters.

   Chapter 8: Spotlight on Multiyear Budgeting as a Tool for Coordinating Investments
       o This chapter assesses the benefits of adopting a multiannual budgetary
           framework for the PNDL and more broadly in Romania’s public sector.
       o It provides a diagnostic of the status quo regarding current budgeting
           practices at the central level and discusses challenges to moving toward
           multiyear budgeting.


   Chapter 9: Spotlight on Territorial Contracts as a Tool for Coordinating Investments
       o This chapter assesses the benefits of adopting a multiannual budgetary
           framework for the PNDL and more broadly in Romania’s public sector.

Chapter 1: The Case for Coordinating Public Infrastructure
Investments
59.       This chapter defines this final report’s theoretical framework, distinguishing between
critical concepts like coordination, prioritization, and selection of public investments , including
through a set of proposed criteria. In principle, public investments include the full range of
projects funded, in part or in full, by public funds (from the supranational and/or national and/or
subnational level). In particular, this report only focuses on “hard” investments in physical
infrastructure: roads (county and communal/local); water and wastewater systems (catchment,
treatment, transport, etc.); and social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, cultural centers, sport
venues, etc.).

60.      Before focusing on the topic at hand, the starting p oint is to ask: ultimately, why are
investments in public infrastructure so important for Romania’s development? This question
was answered in depth in the 2013 World Bank report on “Competitive Cities,” which was
mentioned earlier in the introductory chapter. Essentially, the key to sustainable and inclusive
economic growth is enabling all people to reach their full productive potential. Public
infrastructure investments ensure higher connectivity (in the case of roads) and higher living
standards generally (e.g., water and sanitation services, proper schools, functional hospitals,
etc.), but they can also have a significant economic impact. An analysis of the IMF has revealed
that the absorption of EU funds allocated for the 2014-2020 programming period could help
provide an additional boost to Romania’s GDP of up to 5.3%. This only takes into consideration
direct, indirect, and induced effects of completed investments, to which one may add the
positive economic impact that is the result of unforeseeable economic decisions – e.g., the
decision of a company to invest in Romania because of better highway connections, or higher
overall productivity as a result of improved educational and health infrastructure. This added
impact is practically impossible to quantify at this point.

61.       Beyond the premise that investing in public infrastructure is a positive thing, it is
immediately apparent that there is a large infrastructure gap in Romania in the context of
limited resources to cover massive current needs. An early version of the 2015 General
Transport Master Plan priced major transport infrastructure needs at around EUR 45 billion.
Between 2014 and 2020, county roads and communal roads will require investments of roughly
EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 4.7 billion, respectively. Regional Master Plans developed for 2007-2013
have estimated investment needs in water and wastewater infrastructure of around EUR 23
billion, of which around EUR 13 billion are required to meet Romania’s required targets resulting
from EU directives in the sector. Finally, the estimate for social infrastructure needs for 2014-
2020 is roughly EUR 3.7 billion.

62.     Looking ahead to 2014-2020, allocations from the EU continue to fill only part of the
financing gap, as shown in the table below. To address all infrastructure needs related to
county and communal roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure, Romania would
need to contribute from other sources over EUR 30 billion through 2020 (in addition to available
EU funds, assuming an absorption rate of 100% for 2014-2020). This is a huge burden for the
national budget. The implication is that whatever funds are available should be channeled
primarily to the highest impact investments, and projects should be developed in a harmonized



                                                                                                29

this report.

63.     While significant funds have been allocated for public infrastructure investments in
recent years, Romania continues to have the worst quality infrastructure in the EU. As the
figure below highlights, between 2003 and 2013 Romania allocated to capital spending a higher
share of its GDP than any other country in the EU . However, despite the proportionally large
budgetary allocations for infrastructure investments, the country continues to lag behind its EU
peers in terms of infrastructure quality. This means that limited resources have to be spent much
more strategically to achieve desired targets in a reasonable timeframe. At the same time, this is
not an argument for cutting investment funding; on the contrary, such data suggest that
Romania will need to continue allocating significant resources for infrastructure investments to
catch up to the other EU Member States.

Why Invest in Public Infrastructure? An Economic Case for the PNDL
64.        A key question posed in a recent World Bank report on the National Local
Development Program (PNDL) is whether such an instrument should exist to begin with.19 The
simple answer is “yes.” Pragmatically, per the data presented above, EU funds are insufficient to
cover existing infrastructure needs. More generally, a public investment should only be pursued
if it is expected to generate positive economic impact, and policymakers should look for ways to
maximize the good effects of public investments. In this vein, investments carried out through
the PNDL should be sought where they can have the maximum impact.

65.     The baseline impact of PNDL investments can be estimated using a simple Input-
Output analysis. This tracks the direct, indirect, and induced effects of investments in a
particular sector. For example, the direct effects of an investment in a new road include, among
others, additional revenues generated by road construction companies. Indirect effects include
benefits generated in related sectors, such as concrete or bitumen producing companies.
Induced effects refer to additional goods and services that will be purchased by workers with the
extra wages generated from their direct or indirect involvement in the road’s construction.

66.     To properly assess the impact of PNDL investments, it is important to have a better
understanding of the funds that will be channeled through the program. Given that the PNDL is
not a multiannual instrument, this is relatively hard to do. At the end of 2014, there were around
3,950 projects contracted under the PNDL, with a total estimated value of about RON 22 billion.
However, as was discussed earlier, it will take more than 15 years to finish these projects with
the financial allocation that the PNDL has received in previous years (assuming that no other
new projects are financed in that time interval).

67.      The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” has proposed a
multiannual budget for the 2014-2020 programming period of around RON 13 billion RON – or
2.8 billion Euro. This budget takes current budget allocations into consideration and is
correlated with the EU programming cycle. Furthermore, several scenarios were discussed for
the proper allocation of this budget by individual sectors. The table below includes this proposed
allocation. This sector-by-sector allocation also allows a better assessment of the impact of the
PNDL through an Input-Output analysis.

68.     An Input-Output analysis was performed to assess the potential impact of the PNDL
2014-2020. The Input-Output methodology was originally developed by Wassily Leontief,
earning him a Nobel Prize in economics. The methodology starts from the simple fact that any
investment in one sector will likely have repercussions on other sectors. Thus, the more inter-
connected a particular sector, the higher the impact of growth in that sector. In this
understanding and as was discussed above, any investment has a direct, indirect, and induced
impact. Annex 1 presents the Input-Output analysis in more detail.

69.      An analysis of the direct and indirect effects of the PNDL on its general output in
Romania indicates that for EUR 1 invested through the PNDL generates EUR 2.04. Given that
investments carried out through the PNDL are investments in construction works, and given that
the construction sector is well inter-connected with other sectors, the PNDL will likely have a
positive effect on the economy, providing an impulse to sectors such as: cement manufacturing;
engineering activities; manufacturing of bricks; manufacturing of equipment; leasing of
construction equipment; etc.

70.     The total increase in value added as a result of PNDL investments is also significant, at
around EUR 2.1 billion. This figure can be understood largely as the additional profits that can
be generated in a sector as a result of specific investments. Some sectors, however, have a much
higher value added than others. For example, the development of a software program may cost



                                                                                                           32
as much as the construction of a tractor. However, the tractor may be sold only once, while the
software program can be replicated ad infinitum with minimal expenses and can be sold just as
many times. Consequently, the value added of the software sector is higher than the value
added of the tractor production sector. Overall, the value added of the construction sector
(where PNDL investments in public infrastructure fall into) is lower than the value added that
could be generated through some services sectors, but the effect is still large.

71.      Moreover, PNDL investments could increase employee compensation by around EUR
680 million. Given that the PNDL primarily focuses on construction activities that require
relatively low-skilled labor, the impact on employee compensation is not as large as it could be in
some higher value-added sectors – e.g., software development, financial services, media, etc.

72.     It is important to notice that the Input-Output analysis summarized above only
captures estimated direct, indirect, and induced effects of additional sector investments and
misses other potential benefits. For example, it cannot measure the productivity gains that may
be made possible by a public infrastructure investment – e.g., by enabling people in an area to
spend less time commuting. Similarly, it cannot capture the gains that generations of school
children may reap from studying in better-equipped buildings. Neither can the Input-Output
analysis measure the synergy effects of coordinated investments – e.g., coupling a road
investment made through the PNDL with an EU-funded road and thus lowering commuting time
for a much larger population.

Coordination of Public Infrastructure Investments
73.     Based on the arguments above, two basic insights are that public infrastructure
investments (including through the PNDL) can be generally beneficial, but available resources
are much lower than what current needs would require. In this context, the question asked in
the beginning of this report becomes critic al: how can public authorities “do more with less”?
The following sub-sections provide the theoretical foundation for answering this question in the
subsequent diagnostic and recommendations chapters.

What Is Coordination?
74.      As defined in the final report o n “Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and
State-Funded Investments in Romania’s Infrastructure ,” coordination refers to the capacity of
different stakeholders to work together for achieving specific goals. Coordination is never an
end in of itself, but rather a means for reaching a specific purpose: in the context of this analysis,
the aim is to design and implement projects that deliver maximum impact on Romania’s
sustainable and inclusive development. As noted in the previous chapter, the focus is on basic
infrastructure investments – roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure – that can
create the conditions for all people to reach their productive potential and hence generate
economic growth. 20

productivity), see “Competitive Cities: Reshaping Romania’s Economic Geography,” World Bank,

                                                                                                   33
75.     There are three core dimensions to coordination: vertical (across levels of
government), horizontal (across different units at the same administrative level), and
functional (across various phases). This typology can be further explained as follows:
       Vertical coordination covers the relationships among the national, regional, and local
        administrative levels. At a minimum, each level needs to know what the others are
        doing or intend to do in terms of planned public investments.
            o For the current report, vertical coordination comes into play when designing
                financing criteria, which should take into account higher-level strategic
                documents. For example, roads connecting to an urban center, as proposed in
                the National Territorial Development Strategy (SDTR), can receive a higher
                score.
            o In addition, criteria should also test individual project proposals for their fit with
              strategic documents. This is usually considered under “project relevance,” as
              detailed in subsequent chapters.

       Horizontal coordination includes relationships among actors at the same level – e.g., two
        ministries at the national level, two city halls at the local level, etc.
            o For the purposes of the current work, this includes coordination among
                investment programs managed by different units within a Ministry (e.g., the
                National Local Development Program and the Regional Operational Programme)
                or across Ministries. This is the main focus of the current report, particularly as
                it relates to the coordination of financing criteria across investment programs
                funded by the EU and by the state budget.
            o Financing criteria may also encourage horizontal coordination among local
              authorities by, for instance, awarding bonus points to project proposals
              submitted in partnership.

       Functional coordination refers to the specific mechanisms required at each stage of a
        cycle: i.e., from planning through implementation (execution) and post-implementation
        monitoring and evaluation.
            o For this particular assessment, the focus is on the early phases of the cycle – i.e.,
                 program planning and project prioritization and selection.
            o It is at the program planning phase when financing criteria are designed, though
              how they work in practice should be monitored throughout the entire program
              cycle. Based on the evaluation of such results, criteria could be adjusted later on
              in a program’ s implementation.

Why Coordinate Public Investments?
76.    First, from a bottom-up perspective, coordination is needed when a local government’s
own resources are not sufficient to carry out a particular investment project. In general, very
few local governments have the capacity to support the major investments they need entirely
from their own funds, especially in countries that have not decentralized fully. Based on prudent




                                                                                                 34
capital expenditure margins, communes in Romania can on average only afford to rehabilitate
one road and one school during the 2014-2020 programing cycle. 21 Local government units
simply do not have the financial and human resources needed to address the basic infrastructure
needs of their communities, so other actors need to intervene to fill the gaps – regional
authorities (in countries where regions have formal administrative powers, which is not yet the
case in Romania), the national government (through a variety of state-budget-funded programs),
or supranational authorities like the European Union.

77.     In general, the beneficiary of a particular investment will choose to coordinate only
when the perceived benefits will exceed the costs. Coordination is challenging, time
consuming, and potentially frustrating. In economic terms, coordination implies transaction
costs. The figure below makes precisely this point: the larger (and the more important) an
investment (as a percentage of the beneficiary’s budget), the more its successful completion will
depend on others, so the easier it will be to coordinate across administrative levels (vertically)
and across sectors (horizontally). 22 It is also true that coordination is not always possible. For
example, when the value of a proposed investment is small and can be fully covered from a local
government’s budget, higher administrative levels may have no options to incentivize
coordination. For all other situations, however, the achievable goal for the Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) in Romania is, therefore, to push to the left
the downward sloping curve represented in the figure, i.e., making it easier for stakeholders to
coordinate with one another.

21 See report corresponding to Component 2 of the current World Bank engagement with the
MRDPA: “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects,” World Bank, 2015
22
   It is also true that larger investments can be more complex to design and implement – so for
particularly massive projects, coordination may in fact get harder. The figure is a simplified representation
that does not factor in project complexity.



                                                                                                                         35
78.     Second, from a top-down perspective, there are two reasons why governments should
put coordination at the core of their efforts: to reduce costs and to increase benefits of
infrastructure investments. In resource-constrained environments, particularly after the
financial crisis, it has become vital to deliver the most impact possible with the least funds
available. Especially when it comes to infrastructure projects, costs tend to run high – and, often
times, much higher than what the typical tools estimate (e.g., cost-benefit analyses). 23 For
example, if two or more different authorities are implementing investment programs that have
the same goals and target the same beneficiaries, it is likely that they are duplicating their efforts
and, hence, missing out on cost-saving opportunities through consolidation of operations. The
same goes for beneficiaries who, for a variety of reasons, choose to finance their infrastructure
projects through more expensive funding sources (e.g., state budget funds instead of EU
structural funds).

79.     By the same token, lack of coordination implies failure to leverage synergies across
different investments . For instance, if a new school or hospital gets built, the road connecting to
it should also be rehabilitated. If a county finances a particular county road, the neighboring
authorities may want to consider financing a county road that connects to that investment. In
some cases, it may make better sense to connect to the next commune’s water and sanitation
network than to build a new system from scratch. Another common situation refers to utility
companies destroying a newly paved road to put in or replace different underground networks.
The examples could go on and on, but the simple point is that coordination makes the whole
greater than the sum of the parts. Put differently, any government that seeks to do more with
less should strongly consider placing coordination of public investments front and center on its
policy agenda.

80.      Ultimately, coordination entails great potential, and the need to coordinate is
inescapable in many ways – vertically and horizontally . Regarding the former dimension, very
few local governments have the capacity to support the investments they need entirely from
their own funds, especially in countries that have not decentralized fully. Based on prudent
capital expenditure margins, more than three in four communes in Romania can only afford to
rehabilitate one road and one school. 24 Local government units (LGUs) simply do not have the
financial and human resources needed to fulfill the basic infrastructure needs of local
communities, so other actors needs to intervene to fill the gap – regional authorities (in
countries where regions have formal administrative powers, which is not yet the case in
Romania), the national government (through a variety of state-budget-funded programs), or
supranational authorities like the European Union. As for horizontal coordination, very few
investments depend on a single sector: roads cross railroads and power lines, wastewater
treatment plants influence the quality of water bodies, schools and hospitals function well only
if there is sufficient demand for their services and hence proper connectivity with people in

surrounding areas, etc. The simple but important point is that proper coordination of public
investments is a must in any policy context. 25

How Can Governments Coordinate Public Investments?
81.     There is a long menu of coordination mechanisms deployed in countries around the
world – financing criteria are just one type and fit under the “conditionalities” category , as
explained below. Based on established practices in OECD countries, coordination mechanisms
can be classified as follows: 26
     Dedicated platforms: These are institutional structures, formal or informal, that
        explicitly target coordination and bring together multiple stakeholders – across
        administrative levels and/or across sectors. Dedicated platforms include not only
        bodies/committees/organizations that have coordination at the core of their mission,
        but also specific events that share the same purpose of enabling coordination (fora,
        conferences, online competition of ideas, etc.).
        Co-financing mechanisms: Used widely for both EU-funded and state-funded programs,
         these tools ensure that multiple stakeholders have a stake in particular infrastructure
         projects. The presumption is that if a local authority contributes some of its own funds
         toward the completion of an investment, it will more likely coordinate with higher-level
         funders – be it the national government or the EU.
        Local-level procedures and practices: At the project level, most of the coordination
         efforts need to happen under the leadership of the main “beneficiary” of investment
         funding – i.e., a local or county council in Romania. Different authorities have designed
         various coordination practices, some ad hoc (practices) and others systematic
         (procedures). An example is the mayor of a major city in the middle of Romania who
         brought around the table all providers of public utility services (gas, electricity, water,
         sewage, district heating) and established with a two year lead time a common program
         for sequencing investments. Such practices and procedures can help avoid inefficiencies
         resulting from, say, utility providers damaging a newly rehabilitated road to work on
         their distribution networks.
        Conditionalities (main focus of current report): These include eligibility, evaluation, and
         selection criteria applied to particular funding sources (i.e., investment programs).
             o Vertical coordination (across administrative levels) : A common example is the
               requirement for a proposed (local) project to be included in a (higher-level)
               local/regional development strategy. In the water and wastewater sector, for
               instance, EU funds prioritize investments that are included in the Master Plans.
               This ensures that high-level policy goals are adopted by lower-level authorities
               and reflected in the projects they put forth. There is of course a tension
               between hard top-down conditionalities and the subsidiarity principle of

consequences of the failure to coordinate, see the other report corresponding to Component 1 of this

                allowing local governments to address the needs on the ground they are
                presumed to know best. But there is still value in ensuring that local
                investments contribute to national and regional-level objectives set by the
                government. This is why consultations are critical in designing investment
                programs – including for financing criteria.
              o Horizontal coordination (across sectors/jurisdictions): Some investment
                programs are designed, ex-ante, to encourage integrated projects across
                multiple sectors and/or jurisdictions. In Romania, the National Rural
                Development Programme 2007-2013 funded many proposals that included both
                water and sanitation systems and road rehabilitation. The LEADER program
                required local authorities and other stakeholders to form Local Action Groups
                (LAGs) and submit projects jointly. The new EU instruments on Integrated
                Territorial Investments (ITI) and Community-Led Local Development (CCLD) are
                dedicated coordination instruments meant to encourage complementarities
                across sectors/jurisdictions. 27

82.      In principle, as noted earlier, coordination should happen early on in the cycle – in fact,
the earlier the better. When an investment program is in the design phase, it is much easier to
adjust its key focus areas, procedures, and financing requirements taking into account the need
to coordinate with other instruments targeting the same sectors or other complementary
sectors. This is why it is a lot easier to coordinate across EU-funded programs, which are

essentially planned at the same time and follow the same programming period, while state-
budget-funded programs lack predictability over time and are often reprogrammed and re-
budgeted every single year. Moreover, it is preferable to define ex ante what each investment
program does and properly inform potential applicants about where each of their proposed
projects would “fit.” Otherwise, there is a risk in accepting a project for evaluation under the
PNDL, for example, and later during the evaluation and selection phase figuring out that the
proposed investment is actually eligible under the OP Large Infrastructure. The point is tha t time
and cost efficiencies can be leveraged by coordinating early across investment programs and
their corresponding Managing Authorities. Part of this “coordination” is also the process of
sorting through project proposals and channeling them where they are eligible and where they
contribute to higher-level goals, including for EU funds’ absorption. Generally, if a project is
eligible to receive EU grants, it should not be included under a state-budget-funded program
unless the EU funds have run out and are not able to cover that particular investment.

Financing Criteria: Eligibility, Evaluation, Prioritization, and Selection
83.       In the context of this work, financing criteria refer to the full set of conditions that
shape the selection of a proposed investment for funding. They include: (i) eligibility criteria
that respond to the question of whether an investment can be funded from a particular source;
(ii) evaluation criteria, which form the basis of the evaluation process and imply awarding scores
(and maybe weights) for different categories for each proposed project; and (iii) selection
criteria, which define how evaluated projects will get prioritized (e.g., first-in-first-out rule vs.
competitive selection based on the highest scores received) and selected to receive financing.
The figure below summarizes the various phases of a particular project, from pre-application
through application, selection and contracting, implementation, and post-implementation.

84.      Financing criteria can be effective in enhancing coordination across investment
programs and projects, but why are they needed in the first place? In theory, if the supply of
funding far exceeded the demand, all projects should receive financing, without any of the
bureaucratic steps – and delays – involved in a formal evaluation process. In practice, however,
funds for investments are almost always limited and the supply of available financing is far lower
than the demand (people’s needs for improved infrastructure). Financing criteria are needed to
sift through project proposals and allocate a limited amount of money to a select number of
investments. The figure below summarizes the fundamental requirements and core objectives of
an optimal project selection model – these also apply to the financing criteria, which are a
fundamental part of the selection model.

85.       In short, financing criteria are needed to guarantee that an investment program
allocates funds toward the most impactful investments in an efficient, fair, an d transparent
way. It is thus not only about maximizing available resources to the best possible use, but also
about “proving” to all stakeholders involved that they can trust decisions about funds’ allocation
to be predictable and objective. Even if some local authorities may not like the fact that they are
not eligible or receive a lower score under a particular program, it is critical for a managing
authority to be able to justify the choices made and explain how it reached funding decisions.
This is, in essence, what a prioritization process accomplishes: it ranks projects in the pipeline in
accordance with the agreed set of criteria. Further, budget limitations lead to the selection of a
limited number of interventions in a given year, in the set order of priorities.

86.    Keeping in mind the objectives and requirements listed above, evaluation criteria
should take into account multiple dimensions for each proposed investment. The following
categories are based on multiple sources: evaluation grids from Applicant Guiders for EU-funded
programs (e.g., the ROP 2007-2013, the PNDR 2007-2013, etc.), further adapted in the 2014
World Bank report on the ROP’s project selection models; the World Bank methodology
developed in consultation with the Romanian Ministry of Public Finance in 2013, which
eventually led to GEO 88/2013; the methodology developed for the World Bank’s final report on
“Improved Prioritization Criteria for the PNDL” (December 2014). Subsequent chapters adapt
these categories to each of the three targeted sectors: roads (county and local); water and
wastewater; and social infrastructure).
       Project relevance :
            o Assesses whether a particular investment is in line with existing strategies in the
              corresponding sector or across multiple sectors.
            o This helps ensure vertical coordination by aligning proposed projects at the
              local/county/regional level with higher-level sectoral and cross-sectoral
              strategies.

       Project need/impact:
            o Evaluates the actual need for and expected impact of a proposed investment,
                typically estimating number of beneficiaries (quantity) and the degree of
                improvement in status quo conditions (quality).
            o The use of particular tools (e.g., cost-benefit analysis), in the Romanian context
                and particularly for small- and medium-sized investments (as is the case under
                the PNDL), is subject to much debate. A more reliable approach is to focus on a
                standard set of indicators (e.g., local human development index, number of
                children, etc.).
            o Appropriate indicators may vary by sector. For example, for assessing the need
                for a rehabilitated school building an application should reflect the number of
                children who attend classes, drop-out rates (and expected improvements under
                better studying conditions), overall demographic trends to estimate future
                demand, etc.; for roads, it would be important to look at the population
                numbers, the traffic levels, the current quality of the road; whether it connects
                to a major transport network, etc.
            o A project proposal that can demonstrate higher impact through a coordinated
                approach (e.g., new water and sanitation system, followed by road rehabilitation
                and upgrade of school on the same road) should be rewarded in the scoring
                process.

       Project sustainability:
            o This includes multiple dimensions: social/environmental; and financial.
            o A project proposal should demonstrate attention to social and environmental
              effects and include specific measures to address any potential negative
              externalities. Particular technical solutions may be preferable / “greener” and
              can be rewarded through special bonus points.



                                                                                              41
            o The financial sustainability of any investment is critical – and often overlooked.
              Proposals should demonstrate that operations and maintenance (O&M) costs
              can be covered from the local budget or from the resources of the operator of
              the infrastructure, depending on sector-specific arrangements. There are specific
              indicators to assess the budgetary capacity of different stakeholders. At the
              household level, affordability for a particular service (e.g., water, wastewater,
              etc.) is important to track.

       Project completion rate (only for existing investments):
            o For ongoing projects requiring prioritization, the completion rate can also be an
                important financing criterion.
            o All else equal, more advanced projects that have a higher likelihood of
              completion in a reasonable timeline should be prioritized.
            o By completing projects on time or as close to the initial forecast as possible,
              authorities can save on costs required to maintain existing works, update
              technical-economic documentation, etc.
Subsequent sections include proposed evaluation grids for the three sectors targeted by the
PNDL, with specific criteria for consideration.

Equivalency vs. Complementarity for Enhanced Coordination
87.      What does it mean to coordinate investment programs at the level of financing
criteria? First, the answer varies based on the type of criteria. Eligibility criteria play a
straightforward role by defining the boundaries of what an investment program does and does
not finance. They can be applied to types of projects (most commonly) and to types of
beneficiaries. Evaluation criteria only apply to eligible projects under each program – ineligible
investments should not enter the evaluation process at all – and help determine whether a
particular proposal is worth financing. The selection method can shape how selection criteria are
deployed: for example, in a competitive selection, criteria lead to a prioritization of proposals
based on the scores received; under first-in-first-out, selection criteria only test whether a
project exceeds a certain threshold.

88.      There are two main approaches to enhanced coordination through financing criteria .
On the one hand, harmonized criteria can be equivalent across investment programs. This is
appropriate particularly when the needs in the sector far outweigh the supply of funds and there
are also clear requirements to fund particular investments. On the other hand, harmonized
criteria can be complementary across investment programs. That means that in a given sector
one may define from the start of a programming period the list of eligible types of investments
for each fund. Together, these lists should be “MECE” – mutually exclusive, comprehensively
exhaustive. In other words, there would be no overlaps and, as a whole, the funds would serve
all the needs in the sector.

89.    As such, the optimal approach varies by sector, as there is no one-size-fits-all answer:
in some sectors, the first approach (“equivalency”) is optimal; in others, the second approach
(“complementarity”) is need ed. For example, in the roads sector, the ROP 2014-2020 will focus
on county roads connecting to the TEN-T network; the PNDL could take on county roads that do



                                                                                               42
not connect directly to TEN-T, but remain a priority based on a number of other criteria (e.g.,
located in the area of a major urban center, high number of beneficiaries, etc.). By contrast, for
the water and sanitation sector, the PNDL should maintain the EU requirements of focusing on
localities over 50 people for water and over 2,000 p.e. for sewage systems, in accordance with
Water and Wastewater Master Plans. Why not focus on localities that are not eligible for EU
funds through the Large Infrastructure OP or the PNDR 2014-2020? The answer is simple: the
priority lists have already been established by the Master Plans based on clear criteria, and
Romania still needs to fulfill EU-level commitments in the water and wastewater sector, as
explained in Chapter 3. This is why it is best to go down the list of priority projects from the
Master Plans, covering as many beneficiaries as possible with the limited funds available. Finally,
for social infrastructure, the PNDL should make sure that it evaluates and prioritizes investments
based on a set of criteria that are similar to those used by EU funds – these are sensible
measures for making sure that the investments have the desired impact (e.g., sufficient number
of students or patients, adequate focus on marginalized and/or low-income communities, etc.).
Subsequent chapters further illustrate these two approaches to coordination (equivalency vs.
complementarity).

Chapter 2: Diagnostic of Current Financing Criteria as Coordination
Tools
90.      This chapter briefly presents the status quo, focusing on the criteria – or lack thereof –
that shape how state-budget-funded programs allocate available financing. The chapter starts
with an overall diagnostic of financing criteria deployed under various investment programs.
Further, this section narrows in on the PNDL, discussing the main steps in its program cycle and
anticipating potential ways to improve coordination. While the PNDL is at the heart of this
technical assistance, many of these conclusions typically hold for other state-funded investment
programs too. But positive exceptions are also present in the Romanian context, even strictly
beyond EU funds. In fact, the final section of this chapter presents some good practice examples
from two programs for improving educational infrastructure, both managed by the Ministry of
Education and both benefiting from considerable lending from several International Financial
Institutions.

91.     Overall, the conclusion remains sober: state-budget-funded programs typically lack
strong financing criteria, hence missing out on coordination opportunities – both among
themselves and with EU-funded programs. The next two chapters take up some of these lessons
and focus on avenues for enhancing coordination in each of the three main sectors targeted by
the PNDL: roads (county and communal); water and wastewater; and social infrastruct ure
(health, education, culture, and sports).



Overall Diagnostic
92.     The following table summarizes the main priority axes and eligible investments under
each of the key EU and state-budget-funded programs. Two straightforward conclusions can be
drawn by looking at this snapshot, even at this early point in the current analysis: (1) EU funds
are defined in a complementary manner, with a conscious effort to coordinate interventions, as
emphasized repeatedly throughout this report; (2) state-budget-funded programs reviewed
here make no attempt to coordinate among themselves and with other EU instruments, but
rather finance a long list of investments, causing significant overlaps with other programs. As
noted in the previous chapter, this creates a competitive dynamic among funds, with state-
budget-funded instruments typically crowding out EU investments because they finance the
same types of interventions under more flexible rules and monitoring. Moreover, there is no
attempt to leverage synergies across different programs.

The PNDL Project Cycle
93.     To begin with, there is no formal strategy specific to the PNDL. At the time of its
launch, the PNDL was an important expression of the new cabinet’s commitment to the
development of rural infrastructure, as reflected in the 2013-2016 Governing Program (as
approved by Parliament through decision 45/2012). For example, one of the key objectives
for Romania’s regional development is defined as the financing of a basic package of
services for rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social infrastructure etc.,
“for achieving [at least] minimum standards of living.” 28 The same document further
emphasizes the need to prioritize public infrastructure projects to contribute to Romania’s
sustainable, balanced development. 29 Other than these broad commitments, there are no
defined policy priorities and objectives for the PNDL. The program’s strategic framework is
broad enough to accommodate a variety of projects, without hard constraints around what
to finance and in what proportion.

94.      The PNDL focuses primarily on roads, water, and sewage projects, but other types
of investments (e.g., social infrastructure, cultural sites, sports centers, etc.) can also be
eligible for financing . Article 7 in the GEO describes the list of intervention areas (similar to
“axes” of EU-funded programs):
        Water supply systems and drinking water treatment plant;
        Sewage systems (networks) and wastewater treatment plant;
        Education units (kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high schools, etc.);
        Healthcare units in rural areas (clinics, pharmacies, etc.);
        Public roads (i.e., county roads, local interest roads, commune roads and/or public
         roads within localities);
        Bridges, culverts, and/or footbridges;
        Local cultural facilities, such as libraries, museums, multi-functional cultural centers,
         and theaters;
        Landfills;
        Public, commercial markets, fairs, cattle fairs, as applicable;
        Sports facilities; and
        Headquarters of local public authorities and other subordinated public
         institutions. 30
The types of eligible works include construction of new infrastructure, as well as extension,
rehabilitation, and upgrading of existing infrastructure. Essentially, through such broad
conditions, the PNDL is able to cover the MRDPA’s entire vast portfolio of projects – both
previously-financed interventions (at various stages of completion) and brand new
investments, by all types of local public beneficiaries (from local councils in communes and
cities to county councils).

95.     Based on the budget allocation among ministries, as agreed at the government
level and approved by Parliament, the MRDPA establishes the PNDL’s total annual
budget. Next, the MRDPA allocates sums for each county, sub-program, and specific areas
of intervention, based on a Ministerial Order. The criteria for allocating sums across
counties are described in Annex 2 to the PNDL Methodological Norms. 31 In short, the three
main types of criteria that shape the allocation of PNDL funds from the national to the
county level are based on ongoing (unfinished) projects (number and funding needs),
demographic data (county population and surface area), and financial capacity.

96.      While the PNDL norms include some indicators to decide on the funding
allocation for each county, the methodology shows much room for improvement. For
one, the law is not clear which of the three main criteria are factored into the funding
allocation, merely noting that “at least one of [them] should be considered.”32 Second,
there are no defined weights for individual criteria or for sub-criteria within the main
categories (e.g., number of ongoing projects vs. their funding needs). Third, it is unclear
how certain indicators would be measured in practice, particularly the administrative-
territorial units’ capacity to co-finance investment projects. One proxy that could be used
would be non-earmarked revenues as a share of total revenues, 33 in the absence of clear
commitments (e.g., local/county council decisions to co-finance particular investments).
Finally, other potentially relevant indicators are missing. For example, the PNDL does not
seem to take into account a county’s development level, measured as GDP per capita (as
used for the Regional Operat ional Programme in deciding the split across Romania’s eight
planning regions).

97.       It is worth highlighting that final decisions regarding the PNDL’s allocation of
funding belong entirely to the MRDPA. In this process, it is presumed that the Ministry
makes use of county-level data, provided either directly by county/local authorities or by
other central bodies (e.g., the Ministry of Finance). Once it makes a decision on the
anticipated funding allocation, the MRDPA communicates it to county councils. Based on
these expectations, county councils further interact with local authorities to begin making a
list of investments that may be financed through the PNDL. Based on data available at this
point, it is unclear whether at this stage the MRDPA decides only on the funding allocation
per county or goes beyond that. Article 8 of GEO 28/2013 implies the latter: specifically,
“the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration shall prepare and
approve by order of the Minister of Regional Development and Public Administration the
distribution of the amounts intended to the Program, per counties, per each sub-program,
and per specific areas of intervention.” 34 It is equally unclear if the MRDPA pre-selects
investment projects to be included in the PNDL, as implied by Article 9 (3), as opposed to
putting together the list of investments based on inputs from local and county authorities,
as implied by Article 9 (4) and by the Methodological Norms.

Box 2. Allocation criteria for the PNDL budget

      “For the balanc ed distribution of funds to counties, at least one of the following
      indicators should be considered:

      (1) Weight of number of ongoing investment projects for each county, based on:
           The number of ongoing investment projects for each county as a share of total
              ongoing investments at the national level;
           The funding needs for completing the investment projects started and not
              completed as a share of the total funding needs for completing the investment
              projects started and not completed at national level.

      (2) Demographic and administrative-territorial data of counties, considering:
            The weight of the number of administrative-territorial units in the county as a
             share of the total number of administrative-territorial units at the national level;
            The weight of the county population as a percentage of the total population of
             the country;
            The weight of the county area as a percentage of the total area of the country.

      (3) Administrative-territorial units’ financial capacity , considering the share of units’
      capacity to participate with funds from the local budget for achieving investment
      objectives.”

98.      In any case, at the beginning of 2014, the (initial) funding allocation was roughly
equivalent across counties – around EUR 5 to EUR 5.7 million. On the one hand, this
demonstrates the MRPDA’s commitment to making the PNDL funds available to authorities
in all parts of Romania. On the other hand, the outcome may suggest that there is no clear
prioritization of investments based on counties’ different c haracteristics. By contrast, the
ROP 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 (in draft form, as of August 2014), for example, made
specific commitments to less developed areas, allocating significantly larger shares of
funding particularly to the North-East, South-East, and South Regions.

99.     Once the MRDPA decides on the indicative PNDL funding allocation for each
county, county councils put together the list of projects proposed at the county and local
level – both new and ongoing/unfinished investments. 35 To this end, local authorities
submit their proposals to county councils or, “in justified circumstances,” directly to the
MRDPA, as recently mandated by Article 3 of GEO 30/2014 and MRDPA Minister Order
919/2014. It is unclear what situation would qualify as “justified.” T he PNDL Methodological
Norms include a clear template for project proposals, which applies to both new and
ongoing investments. 36 This asks for: the name of the project; the name of the
applicant/local authority; the location of the project; main physical characteristics; total

value of the investment; total value of eligible costs to be financed from the PNDL; data
regarding the design contract (contract ID number, value, etc.); and, for ongoing
investments, the data regarding the construction works, the percentage of the project
completed to date, and the deadline for project completion.

100. Next, county councils have 15 days to send to the MRDPA the list of proposed
investments, based on Annex 3 of the PNDL Methodological Norms. Essentially, this is a
table listing the projects proposed for financing through the program in a particular year,
divided up by new and ongoing investments, and further by sub-program (i.e., “the
modernization of the Romanian village,” “urban regeneration of municipalities and towns, ”
and “county-level infrastructure”). The list of proposed investments has to be accompanied
by a justification note explaining how each county council decided to prioritize projects
submitted by local authorities.

101. Under the current PNDL framework, county councils prioritize project proposals
from local authorities within their jurisdiction based on four possible criteria, out of which
“at least one should be used”:
       Signing date of the goods/work/service contract, as applicable;
       Physical status (% complete);
       Population benefitting from the investment; and
       Local budget’s percentage of co-financing.

102. As with the PNDL’s criteria for allocating funds between counties, the current
prioritization criteria for selecting interventions within counties are broad and
ambiguous. This means that county councils have significant leverage to decide how to
prioritize investments in their jurisdiction. In their current form, the methodological norms
do not require county councils to use all four criteria, but merely to choose one out of the
four listed above. This may mean that a county could decide solely based on the number of
beneficiaries, while another could only look at the signing date of the contract. At the same
time, it is unclear how a particular criterion should be deployed: for example, would a
project with an older signing date take precedence over a newer one, or the other way
around? Also, how should a local authority measure the population benefitting from a
specific investment, say a local road that connects to a national road? It could be just the
population of a commune or the population of a much larger area (e.g., within 20, 40, or
even 60 minutes of the locality). Additionally, there are no defined weights among criteria.
Interviews with county council representatives revealed that there is no standard approach
to how investments are selected and prioritized – this flexibility is valued by local and
county authorities, Most County Councils appreciate the flexibility, but it is also true that
there are opportunities to enhance transparency and rigor by aligning PNDL procedures and
criteria with those applicable to EU-funded programs.

103. Based on the lists received from county councils across Romania, the MRDPA
makes the final selection of projects that receive PNDL funding in a given year. Once
again, the methodological norms do not define a clear, transparent selection process. The




                                                                                           57
final selection is to be based on the proposals received from county councils, as well as on
“[the Ministry’s] own data and specialized assessments.”37 It is unclear what data are
deployed in such evaluations. The same document notes that the selection is done
exclusively by the MRDPA if county councils do not abide by the 15-day timeline or if they
fail to prioritize investments based on at least one of the four criteria specified in the law.
The finalized list of interventions is approved through the MRDPA’s Minister Order,
including an annex with the full set of projects (for each of them, the annex simply notes
the name of the administrative-territorial unit, the name of the project, and the sum
channeled from the state budget).

104. There are slightly different requirements for applicants with ongoing vs. new
projects. For the former, local authorities need to send to the MRDPA the documents that
show the project’s current phase of completion, the updated value of remaining expenses
to be incurrent for the finalization of the intervention, and public procurement contracts
that have been signed previously, including addenda, if any. Upon verification of such
documents, the process can move forward to the contracting phase.

105. For new investment projects, beneficiaries are required to submit to the MRDPA
the corresponding technical documentation. In most cases, this refers to feasibility studies
for new interventions or the documentation for approving intervention works (DALI 38 ) for
existing infrastructure. Feasibility studies and DALIs are not eligible for reimbursement
through the PNDL and have to have been developed through the applicant’ s own resources,
in accordance with the regulations set by GD 28/2008. GEO 28/2013 also notes that the
documentation must prove that the proposed projects abide by the applicable cost
standards. However, cost standards are provided only for county roads, communal roads,
and for water projects. No cost standards are provided for wastewater projects, as these
are considered to require quite different technical solutions from case to case. 39

106. It is worth noting that local authorities who seek to access PNDL fun ds do not
submit formal applications that are comparable to the complex documents required by
EU-funded programs. The bulk of an “application” is the technical documentation
corresponding to the proposed project – i.e., the feasibility study and/or the detailed
technical design. In field interviews, PNDL beneficiaries express satisfaction with the current
system’s simplicity and relatively quick processing of applications. In effect, under the
current system, requiring a formal form with categories similar to those included in
applications for EU funds – e.g., “project relevance for strategic objectives,” “economic
impact,” “technical features,” “social/environmental impact,” etc. – would not add much
value. This is because the actual prioritization and, essentially, the “preselection” of
projects happen at the level of county councils. The MRDPA only verifies that submitted
proposals are in accordance with a set of criteria – it is more of an eligibility check than a

   “Documentație de Avizare a Lucrărilor de Interventii” (Documentation for the Approval of
Intervention Works).
39
   In practice, MRDPA technical staff use a simple rule of thumb for benchmarking sanitation
projects, namely that they should not exceed 1.5 times the cost of equivalent water projects.




                                                                                                58
thorough technical and financial evaluation. This is not to say that the technical-economic
data related to the project is not assessed by MRDPA evaluators, but only that projects that
make it thus far generally go through contracting. Even if a proposal initially fails the check,
MRDPA staff recommends the necessary improvements to beneficiaries, enabling projects
to move to the next phases (pending the successful resolution of suggested changes).

107. More recently , changes were introduced to the PNDL’s methodological norms to
increase the efficiency of assessing and approving new project proposals. Until June 2014,
the technical documentation would be first assessed by DG RDI within the MRDPA and then
sent to the Ministry’s Technical-Economic Council (TEC). Without the TEC’s formal approval,
projects would not be eligible for financing. Citing the low capacity of the TEC to assess
proposals and the long delays incurred in the process, the MRDPA eliminated this step
through Ministry Order 1851/2013. Currently, new projects pre-approved for financing
through the PNDL only go through an assessment by the technical unit of the DG RDI, which
primarily evaluates the following:
       whether the technical documentation is complete and in accordance with GD
        28/2008;
       whether the applicant’s folder includes the local/county council’s decision for
        approving the project’s technical-economic indicators and for ensuring the required
        co-financing;
       whether the expenditures are properly presented and do not exceed current cost
        standards.

108. Once the contract between the MRDPA and local authorities is signed, actual
project implementation can commence. The exact stages will depend on whether the
project is new or ongoing. In the former case, the beneficiary of PNDL funds will have to
organize public procurement procedures, in line with the applicable legislation (OUG
34/2006). In some cases, these procedures take a long time – due to challenges in court,
lack of offers, or other reasons specific to each project – which may aggravate the risk of
not using up the funds allocated for a particular year. This is because the PNDL is not a
multiannual program like an EU-funded instrument, which creates inherent incentives for
applicants to submit for consideration smaller, easier projects that can be carried out in 1-2
years. If the project is ongoing and construction work has already begun in a previous year
(through the PNDL or a different program), depending on a case-by-case basis, the
beneficiary may continue previous engagement with service providers and contractors.

109. Payments and reimbursements are critical factors for a smooth, successful
implementation. Based on the methodological norms (Articles 16-17), beneficiaries submit
reimbursement requests first to county councils, which then submit a consolidated request
for each county to the MRDPA. This system was then changed to allow beneficiaries to
request funds directly from the MRDPA, essentially simplifying the process by eliminating a
step. Some county councils report, however, that local city halls sometimes fail to send
them a copy of reimbursement requests sent to the Ministry, thus requiring repeated
requests to keep them in the loop. According to county council staff interviewed, they want
to remain involved to be able to coordinate and monitor the implementation process in
their respective jurisdiction, as required by the PNDL implementation norms. Once it



                                                                                            59
approves the requests received, the Ministry channels the funds – within the set annual
limits and based on the proofs/documents received (“situații de lucrări”) – directly to
beneficiaries. Finally, beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of service
providers (i.e., showing that the funds received were used for the intended purpose).

110. In addition, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work prog ress and
reporting updates to county councils and the MRDPA. The flow of reports is similar to the
initial one presented above for financing requests: local beneficiaries send all documents
corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every quarter, county councils send
to the MRDPA a consolidated update on the progress of construction works. Upon request,
beneficiaries are required to send to the MRDPA any document related to the financed
project. For its part, the MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring and controlling the
program’s implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives who,
together with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the
accuracy of reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.

111. The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post -
implementation phase – i.e., tracking the project’s evolution upon completion. At least
based on the methodological norms, once the actual works are finished, the beneficiary
sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the warranty period
expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula documentation (“procesul
verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA. Beyond that, the two key post-implementation
functions for ay investment program – i.e., ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
knowledge sharing – appear to be missing at this point in the PNDL’s evolution. Put
differently, there is no formal process for evaluating the impact of completed investments
and there are no institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past,
current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds. This is not surprising for a young program
like the PNDL; still, going forward, it would be important to set-up ex-post mechanisms to
ensure the continuous improvement of the instrument. Subsequent chapters provide more
in-depth suggestions for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, including through
performance and impact indicators.

Good Practice Examples from the Education Sector
112. This section presents the main selection criteria used for project prioritization in
the education sector for two programs implemented with loans from International
Financial Institutions and financial support from the Romanian Government. These are
featured as positive examples for the main reason that they are less well-known than EU-
funded structural instruments, which have been covered by many technical assessments.
Also, this report does not argue that the examples described below are flawless, but merely
that a more rigorous approach to project selection, based on clear criteria, can be beneficial
to the coordination of infrastructure investments. The diagnostic of current practices with
respect to project selection would not be complete without this brighter side of the story.

113. A first program implemented by the Ministry of Education totals EUR 105 million
and targets pre-school education reform. The project started in 2006 and is to continue
through 2016 with loans from the Council of Europe Development Bank and financial


                                                                                          60
support from the Romanian Government. Under this project, 750 kindergartens in rural and
urban areas are rehabilitated, modernized, and endowed with furniture.

114. The selection of the 750 units took into consideration primarily three categories
of criteria – namely educational, social, and technical (building state). In terms of
educational criteria, the prioritization is made based on the number of the children enrolled
and the operating hours of the kindergartens. To this end, priority is given to communities
with a large number of children enrolled. For example, facilities with more than 60 children
would be awarded the highest score, particularly if they also had an extended schedule
(e.g., from 8 AM to 8 PM). The location of the kindergarten and the poverty level of the
area are crucial to determine the scoring of proposals against social criteria. Hence, priority
is given to kindergartens located in the poorest rural areas, in an attempt to balance the
level of educational activities and engagement between rural and urban communities. It is
important to note that the education and social criteria account for 25% each in the
selection process.

115. Weighing 50% of the total score, technical criteria are based on the condition of
the facilities (building state) and its access to utilities. The building state is established
based on technical assessments – in some cases, such evaluations can recommend urgent
infrastructure consolidation in order to ensure building safety and stability. For example, if
the level of damage to the building exceeds 80%, then the facility would be granted the
highest score (15 points from a total of 100 points). If the damage level was very high, then
the assessment could have recommended demolishing the kindergarten and building a new
one. At the same time, priority is given to kindergartens that had not been endowed with
basic utilities – e.g., running water, heating system, sewage, etc., and to those with
improper spaces or lack of spaces for studying. A special attention is paid to kindergartens
where the square meter per child is less than the standard as required per Romanian
legislation, as well as to buildings that are subject to property restitution claims. The highest
score is awarded to kindergartens that operate in buildings for which a property restitution
claim had not been filed (25 points) and to facilities that operate in rented buildings (15
points).

          d.     Existing space to be divided according to norms         5 points

116. A second program focuses on the rehabilitation of nearly 1,400 schools and 16
university dorms with loans from the European Investment Bank and the Council of
Europe Development Bank, with a total budget of almost EUR 350 million. The
prioritization criteria apply to two sets of aspects: priorities in connection to the project’s
components, on the one hand, and those for the selection of facilities, on the other hand.
The former include a number of actions, such as completion of architectural and
engineering design and rehabilitation works for which feasibility studies were prepared
from a previous loan from the World Bank; replacement of clay bricks-made schools with
new buildings; completion of state budget-funded works for 10 university student hostels
that required immediate attention; modernization, rehabilitation, and development of high
schools in both urban and rural areas; modernization/rehabilitation of school units that
needed urgent work in rural areas; and rehabilitation and modernization works on camp
buildings and student’s clubs in very poor shape.

117. In particular, the selection of schools was made based on three types of criteria,
namely, educational, technical & functional, and cost efficiency. The technical criteria
account for 50% of the overall assessment, while the education criteria for 35%. The higher
the number of students enrolled in the school, the higher the score awarded. Schools
operating on only one shift would get fewer points than those operating on two or three
shifts daily. The facilities providing special education would have priority as compared to
schools for pupils from grade I to grade VIII. The technical criteria involved looking at


                                                                                             62
several aspects, including how old the building was; types of interventions needed; and
whether the facility was connected to public utilities such as water, electricity etc. Schools
built after 1970 would not get any points in the evaluation process, as priority was given to
facilities built before 1920 and between the two world wars. Also, high priority would be
given to pre-university education facilities that required consolidation and upgrading work,
as opposed to those that did not need major repairs.

118. Another technical criterion used in the prioritization process was the level of
access to the neighboring localities by public transport. In this way, the evaluation tried to
determine if students could use public transport to go to another school located in the
neighboring localities. Thus, if public transport would be available then no points would be
awarded to the school. If the closest public transport service would be available beyond 1.5
km distance from the school, then the facility would get 10 points. The school’s access to
utilities is another important aspect. Education facilities that have access to only basic
utilities (such as electricity and water) would get higher scores than those connected to all
range of services (like water, sewage, district heating etc.). Finally, for cost efficiency criteria
(15% of the overall assessment), the lower the cost of work intervention needed per square
meter the higher number of points awarded. For instance, if the intervention work was
estimated at less than $120 per square meter the applicant would receive the highest
number of points in the given category (i.e., 15 points), compared to a school that would
require work of more than $200 per square meter.

Chapter 3: Building a Strong Foundation for Harmonized
Criteria and Enhanced Coordination
119. Before discussing the harmonization of sector-specific criteria in the following
chapters, this chapter focuses on a set of basic preconditions that must be met for
coordination to work. Fortunately for Romania, examples of good practices in this regard
are easy to find and replicate – specifically, post-accession EU-funded instruments designed
and implemented since 2007 feature a number of positive elements that should be adopted
by state-funded programs. Indeed, without this strong foundation, selection criteria on
their own – no matter how carefully thought-out they might be – cannot ensure a
coordinated approach to public infrastructure investments in Romania.

120. It is useful to review what works well with respect to the coordinated planning
and implementation process among EU structural instruments.
        A purposeful focus on coordination from the beginning: The EC has recognized from
         the start that it needs to ensure complementarity among funds and integrated
         investments. Each Member State is required to explain how it will ensure
         complementarities across structural funds. Specifically, each Partnership Agreement
         (PA) has a dedicated section on the topic of coordination. The Romanian PA clearly
         notes: “The complementarities identified among European Structural and
         Investment Funds require an effective coordination during the planning and
         implementation of the ESI Funds in order to avoid the overlaps between actions.”40
         This purposeful focus also drives the choice of harmonized financing criteria across
         EU programs.
        Programming anchored in needs and priorities: EU-funded programs clearly draw
         from and correlate with relevant strategic documents, both cross-sectoral (e.g., the
         Romania-EU Partnership Agreement, the Convergence Programme, etc.) and
         sectoral (e.g., the General Transport Master Plan, the National Health Strategy,
         etc.). These priorities are generally stable across time, so all stakeholders know what
         to expect (i.e., what programs finance, under which eligibility conditions, etc.) and
         can plan accordingly.
        A predictable and stable timeline, with multiyear budgeting, and a strong data
         collection and data sharing infrastructure : The seven year programming cycle (e.g.,
         2007-2013, 2014-2020) maintains the same strategic objectives, planning
         documents, and implementation procedures throughout. Even if political power
         alternates between different parties within that timeframe, no changes occur to the
         EU operational programmes and their corresponding funding, once these are agreed
         in the beginning between a national government and the EC. Stability fosters
         opportunities to coordinate for enhanced impact. An effective IT infrastructure is
         critical.
        A common legal and procedural framework: This is ensured by the Common
         Provisions Regulation No. 1303/2013, which describes how all 5 European Structural

           and Investment Funds (ESIF) are to be designed, implemented, and monitored and
           evaluated. Common regulations were adopted in order to: establish a clear link with
           the Europe 2020 strategy (i.e., ensure coordination between the overall strategy
           and the financing instruments designed to accomplish it); improve coordination;
           ensure consistent implementation; and make access to the funds as straightforward
           as possible for those who may benefit from them. 41 All programs have similar
           application procedures and a rigorous, transparent selection process, explained in
           depth in the Applicant Guides.

        Increasingly effective citizen engagement throughout the entire process: from
         designing a community’s strategy to individual project cycles (from pre - to post-
         implementation). The new Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) instrument is
         a testimony to the increased focus on citizen engagement in EU-funded operations.

121. Very few, if any, of such good practices are present when it comes to national
programs funded 100% from the state budget. There is no conscious effort to coordinate
such interventions, which is evident from the way they are planned through
implementation and post-implementation. There are no standards for how to develop an
infrastructure investment program. In the past, ministries have taken the liberty to propose
such instruments through more or less elaborate government ordinances, some with
criteria for allocating funding, and others without. Compared to EU-funded instruments:
      There is no mandate to coordinate across infrastructure projects, in none of the
         national cross-sectoral strategies (e.g., the Governing Program, the Fiscal
         Budgetary Strategy, etc.).
          The timeline and the budget are annual. There is a high level of unpredictability
           from one year to the next. Usually the list of financed projects is adopted every
           year through a Minister’s order, as in the case of the PNDL. Priorities may change
           without warning along with political changes.
          There are no common procedures across programs for approving, selecting, and
           implementing projects. There are no monitoring and evaluation systems, and there
           is no independent stakeholder charged with looking at how these programs are
           performing.
          Finally, the level of citizens’ engagement in programming and throughout a
           project’s cycle is very low. This means that local authorities may miss out on what
           the community’s needs are in reality, delivering suboptimal impact through the
           financed investments.
The following sections elaborate on the preconditions needed for building a strong
foundation for harmonized criteria, focusing on where the main gaps continue to exist –
i.e., among state-budget-funded projects.

Precondition #1: Focus Explicitly on Coordination
122. For coordination to happen, relevant stakeholders should adopt this as an explicit
purpose. Put simply, public sector employees responsible for the design and
implementation of state-budget-funded investment programs that require a coordinated
approach should first want to coordinate . Coordination with other authorities should be
included in the list of legal responsibilities corresponding to each authority in charge of such
investment instruments. For instance, each ministry has a law defining its mandate; there is
also a Law of Local Public Administration that defines the tasks of county and local
authorities. Both political and technical positions should assume the goal of coordination.
Based on adjustments to the relevant legislative acts, coordination should further be
adopted as a key goal in the bylaws (Regulamentul de Organizare și Funcționare – ROF) of
each authority. Mission and internal strategy documents should also be adapted to reflect
this renewed focus on coordination. Further, this should trickle down to the terms of
reference (fișa postului) of each staff, particularly those in the units responsible for
designing investment programs.

123. This purposeful focus on coordination should also be reflected in the requirement
to include a section on coordination in each programming document. For example, in the
case of the PNDL, DG RDI should cooperate with DG European Programs, which manages
the Regional Operational Programme, to replicate best practices in designing a coordinated
investment program, including in terms of financing criteria. This would ensure not only a
superior correlation between the PNDL and the ROP, but also active learning in terms of
developing a programming document (essentially missing in the case of state-budget-
funded programs, as explained below) and with respect to potential coordination
mechanisms.


Precondition #2: Anchor Programming and Projects in Clear Needs and
Priorities
124. In order to coordinate properly, one has to first know what there is to coordinate.
When it comes to public investments financed by the state budget, proper coordination is
hard to do because these programs are often changing, with priorities shifting from year to
year. If EU-funded programs follow clear and stable priorities anchored in strategic
documents, state-budget-funded programs modify their priorities from one cabinet to the
next and even under the same administration’s mandate. For example, water and
wastewater investments have in the past been funded through the Government Ordinance
7/2006. Funding for these investments had not been predictable since the ordinance came
into effect, and the rules of the game changed again once this Ordinance was rolled into the
National Program for Local Development (PNDL) in early 2013.

125. At the national level, a g overnment’s cross-sectoral priorities are usually set
through a high-level strategic document. The problem is that these priorities are not
always carried over if there is a change in government and/or even at the level of a single
ministry. This is also the main source of the unpredictability of state-budget-funded
programs. To overcome this problem, it is important to identify national priorities that
enjoy political and popular consensus – i.e., issues that most people in the country consider



                                                                                            67
to be of high importance – and keep moving a consistent agenda forward, regardless of
political changes.

The Efficient Use of National Public Funds: Core Principles and Sources
126. Ideally, national funds should be allocated for public investments only when such
projects cannot be financed efficiently by other administrative tiers or by the private
sector. Following the subsidiarity principle, whenever possible, infrastructure investments
should be taken on by the administrative tier that is closest to the people that will benefit
from this infrastructure. For example, the highway and railway network services the entire
country, so its development and maintenance usually fall under the responsibility of the
central government. At the same time, educational infrastructure is typically administered
locally, where the needs are best understood and can be more easily targeted.

127. Sub-national administrative units have some resources available for investments
in public infrastructure, although there are stark differences between the richest
administrative units and the poorest ones. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria
for the PNDL” presents a simple methodology for assessing the prudent capital expenditure
margins for sub-national administrative units. In simple terms, this methodology uses
budget execution data for all territorial administrative units in Romania to determine how
much of their projected cumulative budgets for 2014-2022 – the programming and
implementation timeline for EU-funded investments – could be allocated to investments in
public infrastructure without incurring the risk of not being able to cover subsequent
operation and maintenance costs.

128. The table below synthesizes available data on prudent capital expenditures. What
becomes immediately evident is that over 55% of the total funds that could (prudently) be
allocated for capital expenditures are generated by Bucharest (the General City Hall and the
sector city halls) and the 102 municipalities in Romania. In particular, the 20 largest
municipalities together generate about as much as Bucharest and its six sectors. All 2,861
communes in Romania generate about as many revenues for capital investments as
Bucharest – for each commune, this is equivalent to around EUR 1.9 million on average for
2014-2022. This means that the average commune in Romania can finance from its own
funds only, say, a communal road and a school’s rehabilitation between 2014 and 2022.
Around the same sum was obtained (around 24 billion Euro for 2014-2022) when the actual
average yearly capital expenditures for 2009-2013 (around 2.3 billion Euro/year) were
projected for 2014-2020. However, the Prudent Capital Expenditure methodology allows
for a more reliable estimate of what individual territorial administrative units could spend
on capital expenditures between 2014 and 2022.

129. In essence, communes and towns in Romania have a very low self-financing
potential and, at least over the short-to-medium term, are likely to remain heavily reliant
on EU and central-budget funds for critical capital investments. This does not mean that
such administrative units should put off any effort to improve their basic infrastructure until
they have their own funds to make such expenditures. Rather, the implication is that state-
budget financing, when directed at the sub-national level, should target those
administrative units that have the highest need and the lowest capacity to generate their
own revenues for such investments. At the same time, it is important to ensure that
operation and maintenance costs for new infrastructure are either paid for by a financially
more potent entity (e.g., a regional water company), or can be sustainably covered from
the budget of the beneficiary locality. When a choice has to be made between two poor
localities, a preference should be given to the locality that can also cover future operation
and maintenance costs. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for the PNDL”
includes both a ranking of the development level of territorial administrative units in
Romania (based on the Local Human Development Index methodology developed by
sociologist Dumitru Sandu) and a raking of their individual prudent capital expenditure
margins (i.e., the Financial Sustainability Index).

130. In addition to sub-national administrative units, there are also private companies
that can contribute to necessary infrastructure investments. Private companies often
cover from their own budget costs related to the critical infrastructure (e.g., roads, water,
wastewater, gas, electricity, broadband, etc.) that services their new investment. There are
also companies that invest in business infrastructure (e.g., tech parks, office buildings, etc.)
that may benefit an entire region. To the extent that critical infrastructure investments can
be carried out by the private sector, public funds should not be allocated for such
investments. These are situations where free markets can address the problem without
government intervention, freeing up resources for those situations – such as the ones
described above in poor localities – where public funds are absolutely vital.

131. Companies in Romania have had growing revenues and profits over the past few
years. As the table below highlights, yearly revenues have grown from around EUR 163
billion in 2009 to around EUR 224 billion in 2013 – i.e., at an 8.25% compound annual
growth rate (CAGR), which is significant by any measure. Profits were only a fraction of
revenues, but they also registered a CAGR of 6.38%.

132. Company revenues for 2009-2013 can form the basis for the estimation of
revenues for 2014-2022. Three scenarios have been considered in this respect. Thus, the
optimistic scenario envisaged a growth of the private market in Romania in tune with what
has happened over the past five years – i.e., a CAGR of 8.25% for revenues and a CAGR of
6.38% for profits. The average scenario envisaged a 5% annual growth, while the pessimistic
scenario assumed a 1% growth. Considering these three options, we can estimate that firms
in Romania will generate between EUR 2 and 3 trillion between 2014 and 2022, and
between EUR 120 and 157 billion in profits. These are significant funds and at least a part of
the generated profits will likely be reinvested in needed infrastructure. Given that firm
revenue numbers include double-counting, 42 it is best to use profit numbers to estimate the
potential involvement of the private sector in the development of business and other
infrastructure.

133. Assuming that a conservative 1% of firm profits are re-invested in infrastructure,
it means that the private sector could allocate around 1.46 billion Euro for infrastru cture
investments.

134. In addition to companies, private households can also take on certain
infrastructure investments. For example, people often bear the costs of water, wastewater,
gas, and road extensions to new neighborhoods. Similarly, individual households can take
over financing of investments started with central government funds. For example, the
thermal insulation program started by the Ministry of Regional Development has been
quite successful. The program began with a 50-30-20 financing scheme, with 50% of funds

  For example, the grain that makes a loaf of bread will be reflected in the revenues of: the
agricultural producer, the mill that grinds the grains and sells the flour, the bakery that prepared the
bread, the retailer that sells the bread, and the restaurant that serves the bread with a meal to an
end customer.




                                                                                                     70
for the rehabilitation of an apartment block provided by the Central Government, 30% by
local authorities, and 20% by end beneficiaries. Apartment blocks all over Romania have
been rehabilitated in this way, and many people have eventually resorted to 100% private
financing of thermal rehabilitation works.

135. In 2013, the average salary in Romania was RON 2,163 (around EUR 490) and
there were 4,443,554 employed people, according to the National Statistics Institute. This
means that households in Romania had a disposable income of around EUR 2.2 billion in
2013. Assuming a compound annual growth rate of around 3% in the average salary, we can
estimate that households in Romania will generate revenues of around EUR 23 billion
between 2014 and 2022. A fraction of those funds could be used for infrastructure
investments, such as the thermal rehabilitation of apartment blocks or the extension of a
water and wastewater system. Obviously, households in more dynamic economic centers
(e.g., the largest cities in the country) have and will continue to have more disposable
income for investments than people living in poorer areas.

136. The Romanian National Institute of Statistics indicates that only 0.6% of
household incomes in Romania goes to investments in infrastructure, such as the
construction/rehabilitation of homes. This is not a very large sum, but it is another
potential source of investments – a source that may become larger, as incomes grow, and
as people become less reliant on public authorities for certain infrastructure investments.
However, assuming that not much will change over the next few years, we could estimate
that around EUR 0.14 billion could be spent by households on infrastructure investments
between 2014 and 2022.

137. EU funds complement the sources mentioned above. As the table below indicates,
around EUR 30.7 billion in EU grants are available for infrastructure investments between
2014 and 2022, while national co-financing amounts to around EUR 6.2 billion – for a total
allocation of around EUR 37 billion. For many public administration units, EU funds
represent the main – and often the only – source for needed capital investments. EU
Operational Programmes have clearly identified priorities, and funds allocated by priority
axis help address identified needs. Ideally, a similar approach should be taken in the use of
state-budget funds.

138. Finally, the state budget is one of the key sources for investments in needed
public infrastructure, and it will likely continue to be so in future years too. Estimating
prudent capital expenditure margins is harder for the Central Government given the lack of
budget data and because of the frequent changes in Government. However, one could
estimate available funds by looking at budget executions in the past years and projecting
average values in the future. The table below indicates that on average, the Romania
Government has spent around 2.3 billion Euro on capital expenditures.

139. Assuming an optimistic, medium, and pessimistic growth in coming years, one can
obtain rough estimates on Government capital expenditures for 2014-2022. These
estimates are included in the table below. Thus, in an average scenario, the Romania
Government could allocate around 24 billion for capital expenditures between 2014 and
2022.

140. The table below provides an overview of the different funds that could potentially
be leveraged for investments in needed infrastructure between 2014 and 2022. Overall,
one could estimate that around 85 billion Euro will be available for capital expenditures in
Romania between 2014 and 2022.

Identifying Investment Needs
141. One criterion for identifying priorities – although not the only one – is the
assessed investment need in a particular sector. Often, high-priority sectors are also areas
where investment needs are significant. It is therefore important that when the
government identifies a particular sector as a priority intervention area, it also has a clear
understanding of the investments needs in that particular sector. Understanding



                                                                                                  72
investment needs is required for the design of investment programs, and for the design of
cooperation and coordination mechanisms. For example, the modernization of dirt and
stone roads in Romania would cost around EUR 3.4 billion, while the rehabilitation and
modernization of county roads reported by county councils to be in bad or average shape
would cost around EUR 6.2 billion. To help address needs in the sector, around EUR 1 billion
will be available through the Regional Operational Programme. In the report on “Improved
Prioritization Criteria for PNDL projects” it was recommended that EUR 0.43 billion be
allocated for county road investments through the PNDL, assuming future annual
allocations to the program similar to the PNDL budget at the end of 2014. In addition, it was
recommended that county councils allocate around EUR 2.7 billion for capital investments
in 2014-2020 (part of which would cover investments in county road rehabilitation/
modernization). Thus, through the three different channels, in a coordinated and
harmonized approach, a significant share of investments needs in county roads could be
covered by 2022.

142. The table below gives an overview of the investment needs in a number of key
sectors in Romania. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of all investment needs, but it
gives an order of magnitude of the funding gap that has to be covered from other sources
than EU funds. A larger funding gap for a particular sector also means that the government
has to identify alternative sources of funding and ways of coordinating different investment
programs. A similar table was presented earlier, though the version below is more detailed.

143. A clear mapping of investment needs also enables an easier identification of
coordination mechanisms. For example, investment needs in the water and wastewater
sector are quite large, and meeting the EU Water Directive and Wastewater Directives
targets by 2018 requires a significant effort and an efficient coordination of different
investment programs. For the 2007-2013 programming period, investments in the water


                                                                                                         73
and wastewater sector have been done through: SOP Environment (to become part of OP
Large Infrastructure 2014-2020), PNDR, PNDL (since 2013), the Environment Fund, credits
contracted by regional water companies, and by county councils and local authorities
themselves. This vast number of actors should ideally operate around the same rules. In
particular, it is important that the investment plans proposed in the Regional Master Plans
are taken into consideration by all those who invest in this sector to ensure a coordinated,
systematic approach. 43

Predictable Investments for Clearly Identified Needs in Each Sector
144. Once key national priorities are set by the Center of Government, individual line
ministries should be tasked to take on the implementation of these priorities, with the
appropriate budget allocation from the Ministry of Public Finance. Unfortunately, when it
comes to infrastructure investments funded from the state budget, there is very little
predictability. One government may focus on one type of investment, while another may
set other priorities. Worse even, almost any change of minister (frequent in Romania)
comes with new investment priorities. The table below shows how this reality looks like for
the MRDPA – a ministry with a large investment portfolio. For one, the total annual capital
expenditure budget varies widely – from a high of around RON 3 billion in 2014 to a low of
RON 0.2 billion in 2005. In addition, some investment programs have never received any
funding since their launch, while others received generous funding for a few years
(including through repeat additional allocations within a few months) and no funding at
other times.

145. Because of the unpredictability of funding under state-budget-funded programs,
many projects get started and are never finished. Since funding may be available one year
and not available the next, there are thousands of open construction sites all over Romania.
For example, the first layer of asphalt may be laid for a communal road and left as such
until funding becomes available for the second layer. However, by the time the funds for
the second layer become available, the first layer may be deteriorated beyond repair. In
essence, this translates into a significant waste of resources. Similarly, investments in water
piping may depreciate quickly if the water system does not become operational in due



                                                                                                                76
time. There are also situations where a locality has invested in the wastewater system
anticipating that it would also receive funds for the water system, only to find out that
funding was no longer available.

146. The poor performance of state-funded investment programs is itself among the
causes for the poor absorption of EU funds. Since public authorities in Romania have little
experience with carrying out investment programs on multiannual budgets, they are often
ill prepared to leverage funds through rigorously planned EU-funded investment programs.
In essence, everything has to be learned more or less from scratch – everything from
programmatic documents to clear evaluation and selection criteria and tight
implementation schedules.

147. Clearly established investment needs also help set specific indicators for
individual investment programs. Without a clear understanding of what targets need to be
achieved, investment programs tend to meander aimlessly – financing projects here and
there, and continuing for years on end. The MRDPA, for example, has a number of
programs that have received funding every year since 2005, without a clear operational
document at their foundation to identify the goals that need to be achieved. Many of them
do not track any program-level indicators. One cannot manage what does not measure.

148. Clearly identified needs also help with better budget planning. If a multiannual
budget program is agreed upon, it is also easier to secure the proper budget allocation from
the Minister of Finance, and it is less likely to have investment programs be the victims of
short-term budget adjustments or political changes. Whenever there is a national budget
re-shuffling, it is usually the public investment programs that are first considered for a cut.
However, this is less likely to happen if a clear investment program has been agreed upon.

Predictable Funds for Unpredictable Needs
149. Not all investment needs are set in stone. There are always a number of
unforeseeable events that may require funds to cover urgent needs. For example, the
MRDPA has to regularly cover investment needs caused by unforeseeable weather events.
Although severe weather events that cause public infrastructure damages reoccur almost
every year, public authorities are often unprepared to handle these events.

150. There are, however, ways to make unpredictable events a bit more “predictable.”
For example, weather patterns can be studied over several years to determine trends and
to assess the likelihood of their occurrence over a period of time. Such a methodology is
discussed in Annex 2. It assesses the likelihood that extreme weather events (i.e., floods,
droughts, snow storms, or freezes) will occur in different counties of Romania. These risks
were then compounded to determine the probability of extreme weather events occurring
in specific Romanian countries. The map below translates those risks into actual pecuniary
estimates – i.e., the damages (in USD) that are likely to be caused by extreme weather
events, per county. This can enable the MRDPA to better prepare for such unforeseen
occurrences and ensure that emergency funds are available in such circumstances.

Precondition #3: Adopt a Set Implementation Timeline and Multiyear
Budgeting
151. To be able to achieve investment targets in an efficient, coordinated fashion, it is
critical to have predictability. This requires further, at a minimum, to know the period over
which an investment program will be carried out and to have a clear understanding of the
resources available to finalize planned investments. Without clear deadlines it is practically
impossible to determine whether set targets have been met, and without a clear budget it
is practically impossible to clearly identify priorities. Basically, without set deadlines and
without a clearly limited budget, almost everything becomes “a priority” and there is no
pressure to finalize investments in due time.

152. As recommended in the report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL
Projects,” state-funded investment programs should follow EU programmatic periods –
i.e., seven years plus three years for finishing project implementation. This has multiple
advantages. On the one hand, the EU provides grants for critical infrastructure investments
and the impact of these investments should be enhanced through a strategic allocation of
state-budget funds. Adopting the same programming period means that all investment
programs follow the same overall development strategy (i.e., contribute toward the same
goals), have coordinated evaluation and selection criteria, and lessons can more easily be
transferred from one program to the other.

153. A clear budget imposes discipline in the identification of priorities. Ideally, one
would need a legal framework for multiannual budgeting. However, this is not necessarily a
pre-requisite. EU Operational Programmes function in Romania even without such a


                                                                                          78
framework in place. What is important is to have wide political consensus around a number
of key goals. For example, if everybody agrees that the development of the highway
network in Romania is a priority, then state-budget resources should complement the funds
allocated through EU programmes and, even if there is a change in government, the new
party in power should continue the investments started by the previous cabinet.

154. The Ministry of Public Finance plays a critical role in this respect. It is the Ministry
of Public Finance that controls the budget allocation of every public administration in the
country, and it is also the entity responsible for ensuring financial and fiscal discipline. In
addition, the Ministry of Public Finance – together with the Center of Government, i.e., the
Prime Minister’s Chancellery, as recommended in the final report on “ Coordination of
Strategies and Programs” (World Bank, March 2015) – can play an important role in
monitoring the performance of the different investment programs and can reallocate funds
from poorly performing programs to well-performing ones. In this sense, the Ministry of
Public Finance plays a critical role in the coordination of investments. With the assistance of
the World Bank a special unit has been established for the prioritization of large
infrastructure investments – those of over RON 100 million.

155. In all this effort, it is critical to rely on a functional and effective data sharing
infrastructure. These frameworks and tools require an up-front investment in time and
effort, but once instituted can greatly improve performance and quality of all stakeholder
activities relating to infrastructure development. Modern data-sharing platforms and
accurate data help development project applicants in site selection (including selecting
potential sites in areas where environmental and other impacts may best be avoided,
minimized, or otherwise mitigated) and support governmental decision-makers in making
timely, informed decisions. This requires effective use of common regulatory workflows, as
well as Geospatial Information Systems combined with scientific, environmental, and
programmatic databases in standard data formats.

156. To create such an environment for data sharing to facilitate infrastructure
development processes, governments need to develop a set of policies around multiple
elements. These include: consistent data standards for infrastructure development; data
Sharing Policies for grant reviews; common core IT and GIS Toolsets; paperless regulatory
workflows; and online information portals for dashboard updates and public transparency.
In the United States, the Partnership for Public Service has recently backed a call for
customer-centered government in the digital age. This “ One Government” approach toward
data and services envisions a new cross-agency collaborative approach towards
implementing customer-centered digital services: “Citizens interacting with government
should not have to understand and navigate a complex hierarchy of departments, agencies
and offices to receive benefits or services […] To the greatest extent possible, they should
feel like they are interacting with a connected entity rather than a maze of divided and
isolated organizations.”

 Box 3. The Arches Project - Open Source Heritage Inventory & Management System

  Through an initiative with Jordan’s Department of Antiquities, two international non-profit
  organizations, the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) and the World Monuments Fund
  (WMF) spent several years creating the Middle Eastern Geodatabase for Antiquities
  (MEGA), a purpose-build GIS system to inventory and manage archaeology sites at a
  national level.

  In June 2010, the GCI and WMF completed development of MEGA-Jordan, a web-based,
  bilingual (Arabic-English) GIS built with open source tools. The Department of Antiquities of
  Jordan deployed the MEGA-Jordan archaeological site inventory and management system
  nationwide in December 2010.

  In April 2011, GCI and WMF made available a prototype of MEGA-Iraq for inventory and
  management of archaeological sites to the Iraq State Board of Antiquities and Heritage
  (SBAH). GCI and WMF had planned to expand the capabilities of MEGA-Iraq to document
  other types of immovable heritage. This project has been delayed due to administrative
  changes in Iraq.

  During the development of the MEGA system, the GCI and WMF received many inquiries
  from heritage organizations around the world interested in using MEGA. This interest led
  the GCI and WMF to the decision to develop for the international heritage field a user-
  friendly, low-cost, web-based geospatial information system designed to help inventory
  and manage all types of immovable heritage, including archaeological sites, buildings,
  structures, landscapes, and heritage ensembles or districts. In June 2011, the GCI and WMF
  began to develop the new system, named “Arches” as an open source projec t.

  Arches was designed as a generic platform, specifically built for managing information
  about immovable cultural heritage, and can be configured and customized to serve the
  requirements and needs of a variety of implementing organizations. The project was
  conceived as a response to the persistent need for a system that fits the inventory
  requirements of the heritage field without requiring onerous investment of time and
  resources by organizations to individually create systems to meet very similar needs.
  Equally important were the goals of promoting long-term preservation and interoperability
  of datasets that are maintained in Arches. These needs translated into the extensive use of
  existing standards. As a result, Arches is underpinned by two CIDOC standards: the revised
  International Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage (CDS),
  which has been used as a basis to define the data fields in the generic version of the
  system, and the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), which has been used to
  provide the semantic framework.

   In addition, Arches employs open data standards and is designed to access and process
   geospatial data based on the standards and specifications published by the Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Compliance with OGC standards makes Arches compatible
   with desktop #4:

157. There is significant room for improving state-budget-funded programs by
establishing a common set of rules and procedures, aligned with those applicable to EU


                                                                                         80
funds. The December 2014 World Bank final report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for
PNDL Projects” (Component 2) includes a full chapter (Chapter IV) on measures
recommended to harmonize PNDL procedures with those applicable to EU structural funds,
for each step of the program cycle: preparation of design and awareness-raising campaigns
among potential applicants; development of project applications; evaluation and selection
procedures (including field visits, the use of external evaluators, etc.); contracting and
required training for actual beneficiaries; implementation (reimbursements, monitoring,
etc.); and post-implementation M&E and knowledge exchange.

158.     Key recommendations applicable to the PNDL include the following list: 44
        Dedicated applicant guide. Once the strategic framework is agreed upon, the
         next step is to develop the operational document for the PNDL – i.e., the
         Applicant Guide. This draws the overall rules for implementing the program,
         offering in-depth descriptions of investment axes and eligible types of
         interventions, eligible expenditures, eligibility criteria (types of beneficiaries), and
         evaluation and selection criteria. For effective coordination, this too should be
         carefully aligned with EU-funded instruments.
        Harmonized evaluation and contracting procedures for all applicants.
            o There should be a single system for applying for funds. The current PNDL
               framework notes that applicants may submit applications directly to the
               MRDPA under “special circumstances.” The law leaves room for
               interpretation regarding “special circumstances” in which a local authority
               may bypass the corresponding county council and submit the
               documentation directly to the Ministry. This alternative was presumably
               introduced to allow local authorities that have divergent positions
               (politically) from a County Council to apply directly to the MRDPA. But this
               runs the risk of introducing double standards. All applicants should go
               through the same process: if the ministry does not think that county
               councils can treat all applications equally, then it should centralize all
               submissions to ensure a level playing field, along with measures to increase
               the transparency of the process. An appeal system may be considered, to
               enable applicants to contest certain decisions.
            o The PNDL should include a technical and financial evaluation (TFE) of
               proposed projects that are deemed to be eligible for funding. Projects that
               are not in full conformity with program rules should not make it to the TFE
               phase. EU-funded programs like the ROP and the PNDR provide good
               examples of what the TFE should consist of. Evaluation grids should be
               published along with Applicant Guides to ensure that there is full
               transparency regarding how proposed projects are reviewed. Importantly,
               this step in the process can be iterative: evaluators should ask for
               clarifications and applicants – with the help of their consultants and
               designers – should be allowed the opportunity to improve the submitted

          documentation. A maximum number of clarification rounds can be set to
          two, as is typical for the EU-funded programs. It may make sense to also
          explore the option of hiring external evaluators for this stage.
        o For particularly large and/or complex projects, the MRDPA should conduct
          field visits to check the conditions on the ground for completing proposed
          works. This can also be done on a random sampling basis. The idea is not
          only to sanction applicants whose documents do not reflect the reality on
          the ground, but especially to assist them by drawing attention to particular
          technical and financial aspects. To maintain the objectivity of the process
          and also keeping in mind the limited internal resources at the MRDPA level,
          this phase could also be carried out with the help of external support.
   Stronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms at program level.
        o First, the PNDL should set performance indicators for the entire program
           (e.g., number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for
           each sector (length of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people
           with access to water and sanitation, etc.)
        o Second, to enable the monitoring process to run smoothly, a Monitoring
           Committee could be established, including both staff of the MRDPA and
           representatives of the beneficiaries (e.g., one representative per county).
           Monitoring should also rely on County Councils and on local communities
           themselves.
   Stronger monitoring at the project level.
        o A proper monitoring is the first step in enabling the MRDPA to correct
           issues promptly as they develop during the project implementation phase.
           Currently, the system is based on simple desk reviews of submitted
           documents, as there are no continuous mechanisms for verifying the works
           on the ground. This is critical in terms of providing a constant flow of
           information regarding how projects are advancing, how much funds they
           would require at different stages in their implementation, where delays are
           accumulating and why, etc.
        o For its part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall program
           monitoring role, with specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on
           a defined methodology (e.g., as mentioned earlier, larger/more complex
           projects should be more carefully scrutinized). In addition, the MRDPA
           could rely on a more active involvement by county council representatives,
           as well as on independent auditors. It is highly recommended to implement
           a standard electronic reporting system, easily accessible by all local
           authorities, who should be incentivized to gradually move away from hard-
           copy report submissions. This would enable faster processing and real-time
           monitoring of progress.
   Adoption of harmonized procedures for the post-implementation phase, following
    the example of EU funds.
        o The first step in establishing a proper M&E system for the post-
           implementation phase is to define and agree on a set of performance
           indicators for each financed project. Based on Romania’s experience with


                                                                                      82
           EU funds, PNDL applicants should be encouraged to select from a pre-
           defined list, customized based on type of investment, which would be easy
           to implement particularly through an e-application form. At a minimum,
           chosen indicators should abide by the “SMART” set of criteria: specific,
           measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-oriented. As an alternative,
           applicants could be free to choose their own targets, but evaluators should
           be allowed and instructed to correct these based on the principles
           enunciated above. These solutions would avoid instances of beneficiaries
           over-promising on the impact of their projects and would also save time
           when preparing the monitoring reports.
       o There is also a need to continue monitoring visits in the field for a number
         of years after the completion of the investment. Again, this can be done
         with the support of county councils or independent auditors. The purpose is
         to see how the project is performing, if the indicators have been reached,
         and if there are any issues worth signaling in terms of operations and
         maintenance.
       o Last but not least, the MRDPA should leverage the experience of
         beneficiaries who successfully complete PNDL projects and involve them in
         dedicated knowledge-sharing mechanisms. One simple option is to add to
         the ex-post monitoring reports submitted by beneficiaries a number of
         questions asking for suggestions for future beneficiaries. It should be easy
         to receive and collect this feedback at the level of each county in electronic
         form, and then send it to the MRDPA for further processing and analysis.
         Another option is to host in-person workshops with successful PNDL
         “graduates” acting as trainers and mentors for new beneficiaries. In some
         regions, successful EU-funded projects are featured in promotional
         materials and project managers are sometimes asked to give talks to
         various audiences, but this practice has not been institutionalized for all
         programs. The PNDL can replicate and improve these mechanisms.
   Development of Infrastructure Centers of Excellence (COEs) for the entire project
    cycle and for a wide range of stakeholders.
       o Infrastructure development efforts often operate in a crowded landscape
         of various stakeholders, including financial and regulatory organizations,
         local governments, and the private development organizations required for
         PPPs. This creates a byzantine bureaucracy that can lose sight of the
         ultimate perspective of the end-user in infrastructure development, while
         also often making process improvement and organizational development
         initiatives seem uncoordinated or difficult to replicate. To more effectively
         work across these diverse stakeholders and turn cross-cutting
         infrastructure initiatives into sustainable programs that continuously
         improve and transform processes, government leaders are turning to teams
         of subject area business process professionals to establish centers of
         excellence (COEs). A COE should, at a most basic level, consist of a team of
         people that promote collaboration and using best practices around a
         specific focus area to drive business or customer-valued results. This team
         could be staffed with full- or part-time members.


                                                                                   83
o When implemented as a shared service, or distributed across functional
  units and cross-functional processes, COEs connect stakeholders with
  process experts, regulatory staff, and other public/private development
  stakeholders through five essential capabilities: clearly articulated
  portfolios of business process services; formalized relationships with local
  government, regulatory, and commercial stakeholders and suppliers;
  effective working structures for delivering the portfolio; efficient service
  management processes; integrated quality assurance.
o There is no single way to design a COE, and organizations should consider
  their specific needs closely when working on designing and deploying a new
  COE. At the core, however, all COEs should serve any or all of five basic
  needs for their area of focus. For the purposes of this report, these areas of
  focus could include infrastructure development financing/grants, PPP
  structuring, permitting, and/or regulatory oversight.
       Support: For their area of focus, COE’s should offer support to the
          business lines. This may be through services needed, or providing
          subject matter experts.
           Guidance: Standards, methodologies, tools and knowledge
            repositories are typical approaches to filling this need.
           Shared Learning: Training and certifications, skill assessments, team
            building and formalized roles are all ways to encourage shared
            learning.
         Measurements: COEs should be able to demonstrate they are
          delivering the valued results that justified their creation through
          the use of output metrics (reflecting the voice of the customer in
          the process).
       Governance: Allocating limited resources (money, people, etc.)
          across all their possible use is an important function of COEs. They
          should ensure organizations invest in the most valuable projects
          and create economies of scale for their service offering. In addition,
          coordination across other public interests is helpful to enable the
          COE to deliver value.
o For example, the Build America Transportation Investment Center (BATIC)
  was incorporated within the United States Department of Transportation
  (DOT) and designed as a one-stop shop for state and local governments,
  public and private developers, and investors seeking financing strategies for
  transportation infrastructure projects. The BATIC’s goals are to provide:
           ‘One-Stop Shopping’ for the Public and Private Sector: Offering
            hands-on support for states and local governments trying to access
            DOT programs and assemble public-private funding packages. Also
            offering tools and resources for private sector developers and
            infrastructure investors.
           Improved Access to DOT Credit Programs: Focusing on key DOT
            programs that leverage credit to generate further financing,
            including Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act


                                                                             84

                         Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loans.
                        Technical Assistance: Sharing best practices from states that are
                         leading the way on private investment with states that have not yet
                         adopted innovative financing strategies.
                        Information to Reduce Uncertainty and Delays: Partnering with the
                         DOT Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center to help local
                         and state governments, project sponsors, and investors ensure that
                         projects are designed and financed to move expeditiously through
                         permitting requirements.


Precondition #5: Engage Citizens in Local Public Investment Projects
159. Bedrock of democracy, citizen engagement is crucial for effective and inclusive
decision-making processes, especially concerning issues at the local level. As the main
beneficiaries of public investments, citizens are the ones who know best what
interventions are necessary in order to bring about development and improve the quality
of lives in their respective communities.

160. The PNDL is a prime candidate for higher citizen engagement for multiple
reasons. First, the program targets very specific interventions at the local level, primarily in
small communities across Romania. This makes consultations both more easy to organize
and anchored into very concrete proposals (e.g., a new water supply system and a new
wastewater treatment plant vs. a rehabilitated school and a new park for the community,
etc.). Second, citizens’ inputs ensure a higher level of ownership in the community, so
projects are better operated and maintained upon completion. Particularly for investments
that require user fees when finished – for services that were “free” before, such as water
and sanitation, albeit of very poor quality – it becomes critical to get citizens’ buy-in before
the project commences. Citizens can also help in the monitoring of the projects’ execution,
noting potential abuses in how the allocated funds are spent. Last but not least, citizen
engagement in prioritizing projects reduces the weight of political factors in determining
which investments should be pursued. When power changes hands between parties, it is
expected that the investment priorities would not change, provided they are firmly based
on the community’s actual needs. This ensures that projects that get started are financed
through completion and, moreover, generate a substantial actual impact on people’s lives.

161. In many countries, citizens get involved right from the planning phase, so they
can decide from an early stage which projects should be developed. Through formal or
informal consultation sessions, people can provide meaningful inputs to the proposed
projects/programs/strategies, as explained in the good practice examples included below.
The final sub-section covers a few cases from the Romanian context, with direct
applicability for a program like the PNDL.

Public Consultations in France
162. France has a long tradition of involving citizens in community affairs, reaching out
to people to express their views and provide feedback on future public investments. For



                                                                                             85
instance, the planning contract between the government and the region ( Contrat de Plan
d’Etat-Region - CPER) covering key regional/local projects is presented to the public before
the document is approved. Citizens have a month to send in their comments and
suggestions on this long-term framework agreement. For example, the projects employing
territorial policies as part of the 2015-2020 CPER for Ile-de-France region are implemented
through Contrat de Developpment Territoriale (Territorial Development Contracts – CDT).
There are 22 CDTs executing a EUR 26 billion large public transportation infrastructure
investment in the Paris metropolitan area for the next 15 years, each contract dealing with
specific issues in connection to the program. The CDTs signed between the state and local
communities are submitted for public consultation, so citizens and interested parties can
learn about upcoming projects in their neighborhood/community and provide their
feedback.

163. For instance, the CDT for the Paris-Saclay region covers territorial development
projects for the communities of Versailles Grand Parc, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, and
Vélizy-Villacoublay. The CTD is a partnership between the prefect of the region, on the one
hand, and communities (communes) and intercommunal public associations, on the other
hand. Both parties have joined hands to promote a strategic development of the industrial
region in order to improve people’s quality of life. This contract defines specific
interventions with regard to urban and economic development, and protection of natural
parks and natural resources.

164. The public consultation for the CDT took place for a month between January and
February 2015.45 The municipality of Versailles Grand Parc put the announcement on their
website, together with a link to all documents in connection to the project. All relevant
materials were submitted to public consultation under a well-organized legal framework. 46
People had access to over 20 documents approved by national, regional, and local
authorities. These included the agreement, an explanatory note endorsing the need of the
projects and main interventions, territorial plans, environmental assessments, and specific
decisions by local and regional authorities. 47

165. Another type of public engagement in France was the Environmental Roundtable
(Le Grenelle de l’Environment) in 2007, when French authorities reached out to citizens
regarding the country’s environmental and sustainable development policy. 48 The public
consultation was organized by the Directorate General for State Modernization within the
Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service, the Ministry for Ecology, Energy,

Sustainable Development, and Town and Country Planning, and was held through
dedicated websites and 18 regional meetings. The process was consistent with the
Environmental Charter according to which every person must have access to information
on environment-related meetings held by public authorities and get involved in decisions
with an impact on the environment. People were asked to endorse or reject the proposals
produced by five collegial working groups comprising employers, trade unions, NGOs, local
authorities, and public sector representatives.

166. The first part of the consultation included an internet-based engagement, public
meetings, and workshops held in many regions and with Parliament, and rounds of
negotiations on several issues . Subsequently, the French president announced the key
decisions and made over 200 commitments covering different areas in the field of
environmental and sustainable development. In the second part of the public dialogue,
significant measures were adopted effective immediately, such as variable insurance
premiums for privately owned vehicles. More than 30 committees were established to
design interventions in transport, construction, and waste, among other areas.

167. Regional meetings gathered different stakeholders to ensure a debate at the local
level and an appropriate representation in the decision -making process. The meetings
brought together 15,000 people from 17 cities in different regions, including large and
average-sized towns and rural communities. Participants included members of economic
and social communities, private citizens, and elected local representatives that put forward
proposals by the working g roups. The prefects (the government’s representatives in the
region) coordinated the process by managing the debates, engaging the mayors, identifying
experts, and organizing the workshops in cooperation with other decentralized
government departments. A person appointed by the State Council had to ensure
transparency of discussions and that the follow-up briefs were not biased. 49 Citizens sent
their proposals and amendments via an online forum held for more than two weeks, in
which 14,000 people provided comments.

Public Consultations in Norway
168. A more sophisticated public consultation model was applied in Norway in 2004
for an urban development project aimed at changing the Southern part of Trondheim
City. The Norwegian Board of Technology organized a civic consultation under a project on
urban democracy and urban planning. Local politicians decided that the neighborhood
should undergo radical transformation by developing 10,000 new white-collar workplaces,
1,500 new residential apartments, a new bridge over the river Nidelva, and local services
connected to public transport, main roads, and attractive public spaces in the area. This
form of public engagement aimed at actively involving ordinary, non-organized citizens in
the urban planning process, in line with the Norwegian Planning and Building Act, and
listening to what they have to say regarding the upcoming urban development
interventions.


49
 The State Council (Conseil d’Etat) is a governmental body in France acting as legal advisor to the
Government and as Supreme Court for administrative justice.




                                                                                                      87
169. Citizens were recruited via press announcements and invitations sent randomly
out to 1,000 inhabitants, and then organized in panels of 14 people each. At the end of
the discussions, a statement with conclusions was handed over to the mayor, explaining
the reasons why people did not agree with the municipality’s proposals. For example,
citizens believed that construction of new apartments was not compatible with the traffic
issues; they also questioned the need of building more office buildings in the area. In 2005,
the project was put on hold until a new master plan for the city was in place. The public
consultation process cost EUR 12,500, which covered expenses for logistics and the
financial compensation for participants, as each panel member received EUR 125 for their
time.

170. The examples presented above show how useful public consultations can be, and
how important it is to have citizens engaged in determining the most appropriate policies
and interventions for their communities . The public consultation on environmental issues
in France provided the platform for a productive regional dialogue and a debate around a
host of issues that eventually helped shape up the national environmental policy of the
country. However, the downside of this approach is the risk of achieving only a limited
diversity among participants given the lack of real guidance, a vague selection process, and
reliance upon self-selection. Turning to citizens regarding local projects employed in
Norway enabled people to voice their opinions on shaping the future interventions in their
community with an impact on their lives. But a shortcomings of this approach is that
sometimes such a participative process can lead to major delays in project implementation.

Citizen Engagement in World Bank (WB) Operations
171. The World Bank has a set of tools for promoting transparency and community
participation. The main instrument is the Community Driven Development (CDD) program
implementing sustainable development and poverty reduction strategies. CDDs are local
development platforms that help communities improve cost efficiency, service quality, and
accountability of sector programs. They are based on the principles of transparency, local
empowerment, and participation, in addition to greater downward accountability and
stronger local capacity. 50 CDDs allow poor communities to get access to information and
financial assistance to pinpoint to specific community priorities under a partnership
between the community, local governments, and other institutions.

172. The WB has provided USD 28 billion in financial assistance to more than CDD 600
projects in over 100 countries worldwide. In recent years, the WB’s portfolio on CDD
programs has expanded to low-income, middle-income, and conflict-affected countries
where it provides financial support for school, health, water supply and sanitation,
nutrition programs for mothers and infants, roads in rural areas, and micro-enterprises.
The CDD approach not only empowers local decision-making bodies, but also enables
communities to exercise control over the necessary resources for delivering basic services.

173. CDD programs bring together multiple disciplines and sectors, in addition to a
certain degree of decentralization of resources at the local level. The WB’s support to
these programs comes in various forms, from research, development of knowledge
products to operational guidelines for procurement, investment, capacity building,
monitoring and evaluation. A good level of administrative and fiscal decentralization and
existence of environmental policies can be an added value to CDDs. Unlike other programs
that involve citizens only in the planning phase, CDDs are relying on citizen’s contribution
throughout the project life cycle.

174. A successful CDD project is the Indonesia National Program for Community
Empowerment, a USD 12 billion annual program over the past 15 years. 51 The program
covers all 72,000 villages and cities in the country, benefiting approximately 45 million poor
people. The consumption gains for the households went up by 9% per capita and by 12%
for the poorest households. Another CDD program that made a significant difference at the
local level is the Second Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project (AZRIP) aimed at rehabilitating
the critical infrastructure in the country and financing livelihood activities, reaching 3.5
million people from 1,800 poor rural communities. Road rehabilitation works have reduced
travel time to schools by 47% and to markets by 26%, while school investment projects
hiked enrollment in primary education by 25%. The next sub-section describes in detail
how a CDD program works in the Romanian context.

175. Ideally, the local community should not get involved in the design phase only, but
throughout project implementation. For instance, compulsory consultations on
environmental assessments take place during project preparation, although they are not
pursued during the implementation of the project. Transport projects should have ongoing
feedback from citizens for an improved quality of road construction or a better system that
should report and address road maintenance issues. At the same time, participation of
citizens could mitigate project risk management, promote continuous learning, and enable
corrections, whenever needed.

176. Citizen engagement should not be limited to a specific project, but should go
further by strengthening the national, regional, and sectoral processes for participation
and feedback, whenever applicable. For example, people’s responses on the performance
of public utility sectors should support utility-based engagement mechanisms, while
existing institutions should enforce project monitoring performed by third party. For
instance, the series of CDD projects targeting village investments in Kyrgyzstan built
decentralized structures and increased capacity participation and engagement at the
local/village level.

Citizen Engagement in Romania
177. Community-Driven Development (CDD) projects implemented in Romania are a
good example of factoring in citizen’s preferences in choosing public infrastructure
interventions . For 15 years, Romania was a major recipient of CDD programs implemented

by the Romanian Social Development Fund (RSDF) with financial support from the World
Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank, in addition to some contribution from
the Romanian Government and project beneficiaries. The RSDF is a non-profit, autonomous
entity that provides support to disadvantaged communities and groups through a
participatory approach, a process in which community members identify what the local
problems are and choose which priorities should be addressed. Between 1998 and 2013,
the RSDF implemented more than 1,400 projects worth EUR 100 million aimed at
improving the living conditions of disadvantaged and poor communities in urban and rural
areas.

178. Interventions covered mainly small road and water infrastructure projects
endorsed by rural communities, revenue-generating entrepreneurship projects, and
community social services centers promoted by intermediary organizations. 52 Most
projects tackled small road infrastructure and water supply, in addition to community
social service centers. Overall, 1,438 projects were funded through grants between USD
20,000 and USD 195,000 per project. Nearly two-thirds of interventions covered small
infrastructure projects. In addition, the program included 133 integrated projects directed
at the social inclusion of Roma people, 150 community social services centers for
disadvantaged groups, 219 entrepreneurship interventions, and 16 innovative projects. 53

179. The RSDF empowered people to be directly responsible for choosing the
appropriate projects for their communities. The RSDF would appoint a person as a
facilitator to help the community identify and prioritize local needs, and subsequently
provide support for project design. The community would establish an association of 10
members chosen through a participative method among the town’s/commune’s residents.
With the support of the facilitator, the association would select the project to be financed.
The facilitator would help prepare the project application and then submit it to the RSDF
for approval. Based on an evaluation (partly conducted on the site), the RSDF would decide
whether the project would be awarded the funding. The selection of local priorities would
be done entirely by citizens through the community association, with no contribution from
the local government.

180. For its part, the EU has deployed a similar program since 1991, in the form of
LEADER. LEADER is an instrument that gives local actors the opportunity to develop an area
by using its endogenous potential. LEADER proved to be a successful approach in
supporting local development by offering local stakeholders a method to involve local
partners in shaping the development of their communities. LEADER is an important
component of Romania’s 2007-2013 National Rural Development Plan funded from the EU
and has evolved into the Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) instrument for the
2014-2020 programming period. 54

181. LEADER/CLLD is implemented through Local Action Groups (GAL in Romanian),
which are entities established under a partnership between public, private local actors,
and civil society. 55 Public stakeholders could be local and county authorities, while the
private segment may include entities from the commercial and banking sector,
entrepreneurship organizations, and agricultural groups and associations. Non-profit
entities, social, cultural, religious associations, chambers of commerce, ordinary people,
and non-registered groups of people can be among civil society representatives. Private
and non-profit entities should make up for more than 50% of the GAL.

182. The GALs design the local development strategy and select the priority projects.
Project selection has to take into consideration priorities identified in the local
development strategies. Each GAL must set up the selection criteria for each type of
project. It is important for the local groups to prove that they have the adequate capacity
to implement the strategy and develop the projects. Local communities must identify the
local issues and needs, how problems can be addressed, and how the endogenous
potential of the region could be translated into actions benefitting local communities.

183. Finally, a good example of citizen participation in decision-making at the local
level is the drafting of the 2014-2020 Development Strategy for Cluj-Napoca. This
illustrates how a local strategy can be built entirely on the expanded expertise available
within the local community. The document was produced through a complex process
coordinated by the Faculty of Political, Administrative, and Communications Sciences from
Babes-Bolyai University, in cooperation with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall. Twenty-five working
groups were created for each relevant sector topic, gathering hundreds of experts from
various areas and backgrounds, such as academics, private and public sector
representatives, non-profit organizations, and professional associations. Examples of
stakeholders involved include representatives from the Babes-Bolyai University, the
Business Women Association, the Community Relations Foundation, the Music Academy,
the Medical School, and the Romanian Order of Architects. Each working group was
comprised of around 30 people, coordinated by 1-3 well-recognized experts. Overall,
between 500 and 600 people participated in the drafting process. 56

184. The groups’ coordinators established the action list, the debates and events for
their groups, as well as relevant partners . All groups acted autonomously. Each of them
had to draft its own strategy that included a sectoral diagnosis and a maximum of five
priority projects. Debates over main topics and local issues were organized, and people
sent more than 600 comments via email. Eventually, a 1,100-page document was
produced, pointing to 18 strategic directions centered on the key strategic concept of
strengthening the human capital by increasing the quality of life. 57 The implementation of

the strategy would further require a strong partnership between the community and the
local administration.

Citizen Engagement through the PNDL
185. The current PNDL has a long way to go in promoting citizen engagement in the
prioritization of local and county investments. As noted earlier, this promises to hold
significant value-add in the attempt to reach a more impactful and informed project
portfolio, insulated – to the extent possible – from purely political considerations. At a
minimum, the local/county development strategies that should lie at the foundation of
project proposals for the PNDL should be produced in a highly participatory manner. Where
local/county authorities have sufficient capacity, citizen engagement actions should extend
to the full project cycle, from design through implementation and post-implementation
monitoring and evaluation. To encourage this approach, the evaluation and selection
criteria presented in subsequent chapters could be refined to reward those subnational
governments that can present credible evidence that citizens have been engaged in the
design of the projects put forth for PNDL financing. This could be done relatively easily by
adding a dedicated section in the application forms and asking applicants to describe how
citizen preferences are factored into the project proposals. The program could further
adapt and replicate some of the good practices presented above.

County Roads
Investment Needs
186. Investment needs for county roads are easier to estimate then for other types of
investments, as they are relatively straightforward and there are also cost standards
prepared by the MRDPA. The table below includes two cost estimates for the
modernization/rehabilitation of county roads. The first method is the easiest to calculate, as
it simply looks at the network of dirt and stone roads in each county and multiplies the
length of the network with the standard cost for road modernization. The National Institute
of Statistics collects data on dirt and stone roads every year, so this makes it easy for one to
make estimates of investment needs in county roads, on a yearly basis. The second method
requires the collection of more in-depth data from individual county councils. Basically,
county councils know the situation on the ground better than any other authority, and can
most easily indicate which roads require rehabilitation or modernization. For the current
report, county councils “self-reported” which roads are in good, average, or bad shape. The
length of the roads in bad or average shape made out of dirt or stone is then multiplied by
the cost standard for road modernization. The length of the roads in bad or average shape
that have some type of asphalt/concrete cover is multiplied by the cost standard for road
rehabilitation.

187. The first method is easier to calculate, the second is a more accurate portrayal of
actual investment needs. Ideally, national funds should primarily be allocated for the
modernization of dirt and stone roads, with the responsibility of maintaining and
rehabilitating modernized roads falling to the county councils themselves.

Coordination and Harmonization

Single beneficiary makes coordination easier
188. Investments in county roads are carried out and coordinated by county councils.
This in itself should make coordination easier. More specifically, a county council will know
which roads to finance with EU funding, for which to request PNDL funding, and which
roads to rehabilitate/modernize with their own funds or with the help of other grants or
loans. Of course, in practice, such coordination at the beneficiary level does not always
happen – at least not on a more strategic level. As can be seen in the map below, there are
relatively few instances where a road link rehabilitated/modernized with ROP 2007-2013
funds has been complemented with another road link rehabilitated/modernized with PNDL
funds. At a minimum, coordination is ensured if the exact same road link is not financed
from two sources (in fact, this is formally not permitted under EU funds). However, it helps
if one strives to do more than the bare minimum. A strategic outlook on the development

of the county road network is critical in this respect, with more attention paid to how
different sources of funding can be leveraged to solve key development challenges at the
county level.

Figure 10. There is little coordination of ROP 2007-2013 and PNDL county road
investments




Limited investment needs and only two major national sources of funding
189. Overall investment needs are manageable and could be tackled with the
assistance of EU, central budget, and county budget funds. If the first method of
estimating investment needs is taken into consideration (i.e., the one that only looks at the
modernization of dirt and stone roads), around EUR 3.4 billion are required to address
needs in the sector. If the needs identified by each individual county are taken into
consideration (i.e., roads reported in “bad” or “average” condition), then the total tally
stands at around EUR 6.4 billion. Either way, both sums appear manageable and can be
addressed using EU, state-budget, and county-budget funds. This also makes coordination
of investments easier.

190. The critical coordination will have to be done between projects financed through
the ROP and projects financed through the PNDL. The ROP focuses primarily, although not
exclusively, on county roads connecting to the TEN-T network. As such, county councils
should ideally apply for ROP funding if they intend to rehabilitate/modernize a county road
that is connected to the TEN-T.


                                                                                          95
191. However, the ROP 2014-2020 programmatic document was not fully finalized and
approved by the EC at the time of the writing of this final report. It is known at this point
in time (June 2015), based on the April 2015 draft of the program, that there will be a fixed
pre-allocation for each region for the rehabilitation/modernization of county roads of
strategic regional importance . These will be Priority 1 projects, which help solve key
connectivity issues at the regional level. At this point, only the North-East Region has an
approved Priority 1 project list. To the extent that funding will become available after the
contracting of the works (i.e., after savings from real vs. budgeted expenses as a result of
the bidding and tendering procedures) there will be a possibility to finance Priority 2
projects.

192. Priority should be given to ROP 2014-2020 projects, as these will be financed with
EU grants. Consequently, the list of PNDL projects should be coordinated with the list of
ROP projects. First and foremost, PNDL funds should not be used to finance Priority 1
projects that have been identified for ROP funding. Second, to the extent that a county
road connects to the TEN-T network, it should be considered for ROP funding. This does not
mean that every road that connects to the TEN-T should only receive ROP funding.
However, to the extent that ROP funds are available, county councils should first try to get
ROP funding for such projects, and only afterward attempt to secure PNDL funding. Again,
the ROP comes with EU grants (essentially “free” or very cheap), whereas the PNDL draws
from limited state-budget resources.


Ease of coupling individual investments
193. Investments in county roads are relatively easy to couple and relatively easy to
embed in an integrated strategy. For example, a road that is started with ROP or county-
budget funding could be continued with funding from the PNDL. Similarly, an integrated
approach that aims to improve connectivity to a growth pole or a county residence could
tap into these three sources of funding to complete needed investments. Roads are
relatively straightforward investments that enable the application of similar technical
solutions to individual projects, making the coordination of individual county road projects
easier.

Prioritization and evaluation/selection criteria and harmonization with selection
criteria applicable to EU-funded projects
194. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” proposes a
number of steps for selecting higher impact county road projects. The proposed criteria
and concrete coordination steps are included below. Both the coordination steps and the
prioritization criteria discussed here are subject to change by the MRDPA at a later date,
keeping in mind that some of the EU programmatic documents – including, most notably,
general and specific Applicant Guides corresponding to each operational programme – are
not yet final at the time of this report’s writing.

195. The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for county road projects
across different counties in Romania. This follows the current PNDL model in that each



                                                                                          96
county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the program. The table below,
however, proposes a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a clear,
specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.
196. The EU funds for the rehabilitation / modernization of county roads are allocated
through ROP. The allocation is done at the level of the regions, depending on their size and
population. The team that produced this report considered that this mode for the allocation
of funding is deficient because it does not take into account the actual investment needs of
the various regions (for example, some regions might have much higher investment needs
for county roads than other regions). As such, the proposal that the allocation of funds for
the rehabilitation / modernization of county roads be made by county is closer to reality
than the allocation by region, which is proposed in ROP 2014-2020 for the rehabilitation /
modernization of county roads.

                                             for completed infrastructure projects. Usually, the

                                             cover such costs.

197. Once the funding is allocated between counties, the next step is to decide on
which specific projects should receive financing. The following table includes a number of
criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in county roads. This model can be applied
to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the former, since the PNDL’s current
project portfolio far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also be
deployed to sort through existing projects and reach a manageable portfolio size (by
suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In addition, the completion rate
of an individual project can and should be taken into account for decisions regarding which
investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion in raking
projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of
the PNDL. As for new projects, these would only be approved and launched if there is
sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all ongoing projects are accounted
for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent years, through
the project’s completion.
198. The prioritization criteria for the projects financed through ROP 2014-2020 have
been developed in parallel with the prioritization criteria for PNDL, which are listed
below. As such, the criteria are coordinated. However, given that there are no PNDL
resources for hiring internal expert evaluators in order to interpret and assign scores to
complex criteria, a set of normative criteria were proposed for PNDL (connection to
opportunities, connection to the main infrastructure, traffic on the county road, population
served by the county road). All these criteria for PNDL are also found in the evaluation and
selection grid for Axis no. 6 on county roads under ROP 2014-2020.

199. An Investment Guide for County Roads is delivered along with this report. On the
one hand, this guide presents the way in which PNDL county road prioritization was done
and indicates at the same time the projects potentially eligible for ROP 2014-2020 funds. As
well, the guide identified on the territory all the county roads that are classified as “1st
priority” and that will receive pre-allocated funds from ROP 2014-2020. This investment
guide also provides a model for making complementary investments – covered both with
EU and PNDL funds – in county roads. Clearly, by making complementary ROP and PNDL
investments, a number of synergies are generated and the established goals set by the two
investment programs are achieved faster. The specific objective that is defined in ROP is the
following: “Increasing the accessibility level of urban and rural areas located close to the
TEN-T network through modernization of county roads”. PNDL investments complement
the investments made with ROP funds and help increase the accessibility of rural and urban
areas through the rehabilitation / modernization of county roads that are not in the
proximity of the TEN-T network.

Communal Roads

Investment Needs
200. Investments needs for communal roads could be estimated relatively easy. A
simple way of doing this is by looking at the length of dirt or stone communal roads that are
in need of modernizing in every county (such data are made public every year by the
National Institute of Statistics), and multiplying that by the MRDPA cost standard for the
modernization of communal roads. It is unfeasible to do an in-depth assessment of the
state of all communal roads, as the existent network is extensive. Moreover, local
authorities should normally ensure the rehabilitation and maintenance of communal roads
that have already been modernized.

201. Current investment needs in communal roads are relatively modest, at around
EUR 4.7 billion. This in essence should make the coordination of investments in communal
roads somewhat easier. There are funds available for such investments through the PNDL
and the PNDR. In addition, communes can allocate their own funds (although most have
little to spare) for such investments, and county councils also carry on such work when they
deem necessary.

Coordination and Harmonization
202. Coordinating investments in communal roads is not necessarily difficult, but it is
somewhat more complicated than the coordination of county roads. Some key issues with
respect to coordination are discussed below.

Lack of capacity for coordinated approaches
203. Rural authorities often lack the capacity to prepare good projects and encourage
integrated approaches. Earlier in this report it was estimated that, on average, communes
in Romania can spend on capital investments less than EUR 1.8 million over 2014-2022.
This basically means that most communes in Romania can afford, at most, to modernize a
communal road and rehabilitate a school. On the one hand, this lack of resources translates
into poorly prepared projects. On the other hand, it means that communes will often have
little resources to spare for the maintenance of the developed infrastructure. The lack of
resources, particularly human capital, also means coordination of individual projects is
harder to achieve.

Danger of crowding out EU funded projects
204. While the PNDR finances larger communal projects, the PNDL has a much bigger
project portfolio. Since communal road projects are easier to design than other project
types (e.g., water and wastewater), many local authorities prefer these types of projects.
Also communal roads are quite visible, and they are often used by mayors to show the
electorate that something concrete has been achieved in the community. Since for the
PNDL there is no budget allocation by sector, projects are funded as they come through the
pipeline. As such, the PNDL now has a very large portfolio of communal road projects. The
danger is, of course, that many communes will prefer to fund their roads with PNDL funds
rather than resort to EU funding, simply because PNDL funds are easier to access –
particularly in the context of low project management capacity, as is the case in many rural
localities in Romania. This creates an unwanted situation, as it is much better to rely on EU
grants to finance such investments that on state-budget resources, for all the
aforementioned reasons.



                                                                                         102
205. The large portfolio of PNDL communal road projects also means that adequate
coordination with the PNDR is a prerequisite. As the map below indicates, the large
majority of territorial administrative units in Romania have used PNDL or PNDR funds to
fund communal road projects. There are also many territorial administrative units with
PNDL-PNDR funding “overlaps” – i.e., they have accessed both types of funding for road
rehabilitation/modernization work.

206. To properly coordinate PNDL and PNDR investments, it is important to have the
final PNDR Applicant Guide. While the PNDR upper threshold for communal road projects
could also be used for PNDL projects, it is important to have the full PNDR evaluation and
selection criteria to design appropriate coordination mechanisms.

Prioritization and evaluation/selection criteria and harmonization with selection
criteria applicable to EU-funded projects
207. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” proposes a
number of steps for selecting higher impact communal road projects. These criteria are
included below. Both the coordination steps and the prioritization criteria discussed here
are subject to change by the MRDPA at a later date, keeping in mind that some of the EU
programmatic documents – including, most notably, general and specific Applicant Guides
corresponding to each operational programme – are not yet final at the time of this report’s
writing.




                                                                                       103
208. The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for communal road
projects across different counties in Romania. This follows the current PNDL model in that
each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the program. The table
below, however, proposes a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a clear,
specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.
209. The proposed funds allocation model for communal roads under PNDL is closer to
reality than the model for the allocation of funds under PNDR. Considering PNDL, a
county-level allocation based on effective needs was proposed, knowing that PNDR
finances projects at the national level irrespective of region. As such, some counties may
receive much more funding via PNDR for the rehabilitation / modernization of communal
roads, compared to other counties – which, in fact, did happen in the programming period
2007-2013. Thus, there is a risk that an important part of the funding is allocated to
counties with relatively lower investment needs.

210. Once the funding is allocated between counties, the next step is to decide on
which specific projects should receive financing. The following table includes a number of
criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in communal roads. This model can be
applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the former, since the PNDL’s
current project portfolio far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also
be deployed to sort through existing projects and reach a manageable portfolio size (by
suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In addition, the completion rate
of an individual project can and should be taken into account for decisions regarding which
investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion in raking
projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of
the PNDL. As for new projects, these would only be approved and launched if there is
sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all ongoing projects are accounted
for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent years, through
the project’s completion.
211. PNDL selection criteria were elaborated in parallel with the evaluation and
selection criteria pertaining to PNDR. As such, the criteria used for PNDL are harmonized
with those used in the case of PNDR. For example, both programs use population and the
local human development index (LHDI) as selection criteria. Other criteria used in the case
of PNDR (e.g. “Creating direct accessibility to other EU -funded investments”) could not be
applied for prioritizing PNDL projects because they suppose a project evaluation and
selection process performed by an external evaluator – which is not possible for PNDL at
the moment. Other two criteria were introduced in the case of PNDL and could have been
considered for PNDR as well – population density and the financial sustainability index.

Funding communal roads projects only in Funds should initially target larger communes, where
communes with over 1,000 inhabitants.   a minimum level of economies of scale can be
                                        achieved.

212. An Investment Guide for Communal Roads and Social Infrastructure is delivered
along with this report. The guide proposes a prioritization model for communal road
interventions supported by any funding source, including PNDR or PNDL. Using this guide
and a common database, management authorities for PNDR and PNDL could make
investments in communal roads in a complementary and coordinated manner. Clearly, by
making complementary PNDR and PNDL investments, a number of synergies are generated
and the established goals set by the two investment programs are achieved faster. The
PNDR concrete objective is defined as follows: “Building local interest road infrastructure,
which will help the reduction of trends related to social and economic decline and the
improvement of the living standard in rural areas”. PNDL investments complement the
investments made with PNDR funds and help diminish the trends related to social and
economic decline, while contributing to the improvement of living standard in rural areas.

Investment Needs
213. The investments needs in the water and wastewater sector are significant. The
2007-2013 Regional Water and Wastewater Master Plans have originally identified
investment needs of over EUR 30 billion. Assuming that all the national investment
programs (i.e., SOP Environment 2007-2013, PNDL, PNDR, and the Environment Fund)
under way in the country will finalize existing commitments, then the remaining funding
gap will be of around EUR 23 billion, distributed by region as in the map below.

214. There are of course other players that have investments planned or ongoing in
the sector. For example, the regional water operators also invest in the water and
wastewater infrastructure. Estimates based on a study done by the EBRD for the Ministry
of Environment and Climate Change58 show that around EUR 2 billion have been committed
by regional water companies for such investments. In addition, investments have also been
funded by localities from their own budget, and in some cases by county councils. For
example, the budget executions for 2008-2012 indicate that all localities in Romania spend
a total of around EUR 1 billion for investments in Housing and Public Services, and a share
of this sum (it is not clear how much) goes to investments in water and wastewater

infrastructure (e.g., extension of service or rehabilitation of existing infrastructure). In turn,
county councils spend around EUR 50 million on average on Housing and Public Services.

215. While overall investment needs are calculated in the Regional Water and
Wastewater Master Plans through 2037+, Romania has committed to a number of earlier
targets in the EU Accession Treaty. In particular, three directives have to be taken into
consideration: the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC); the Urban Wastewater Directive
(91/271/EEC); the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). The importance of these
directives is discussed below.

216. The Drinking Water Directive aims “to protect human health from adverse effects
of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is
wholesome and clean.”59 For this purpose, member states are to monitor at least 48
parameters for all distribution systems that serve more than 50 people or supply more than
10 cubic meters per day, as well as all for all water supplied as part of an economic
activity. 60 The directive further lays out provisions for proper planning, regulation,
monitoring, and reporting. The same directive notes that derogations from its provisions
are possible, as follows: the first two, each limited to a maximum of three years, are the
responsibility of member states; a third “exceptional” derogation can be granted by the EC.
In the case of Romania, as noted in the country’s EU Accession Treaty, the derogations for
achieving the Directive’s targets are as follows:

      Agglomerations with less than 10,000 inhabitants
     — Oxidisability: December 31, 2010
     — Ammonium, nitrates, turbidity, aluminums, iron, lead, cadmium, and pesticides:
       December 31, 2015

      Agglomerations with 10,000-100,000 inhabitants
     — Oxidisability and turbidity: December 31, 2010
     — Ammonium, nitrates, aluminum, iron, lead, cadmium, pesticides, and manganese:
       December 31, 2015

      Agglomerations with more than 100,000 inhabitants
     — Oxidisability, ammonium, aluminum, pesticides, iron, and manganese: December
       31, 2010

217. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive seeks to “protect the environment
from urban waste water discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors.” 61 In
short, the Directive mandates: the Collection and treatment of waste water in all
agglomerations of more than 2,000 population equivalents (p.e.); secondary treatment of
all discharges from agglomerations of over 2,000 p.e. and more advanced treatment for
agglomerations of over 10,000 population equivalents in sensitive areas and their

food-processing industry, and of industrial discharges into urban wastewater collection

controls of sewage sludge disposal and reuse, and treated waste water reuse when
possible. The text of the Directive was formally adopted in 1993, with an implementation
timeline of up to the end of 2005. For Romania and other new EU member states, however,
a different timetable was set at the time of accession. The implementation schedule with
intermediate and final targets is provided below:

218. The EU Water Framework Directive was adopted with the aim of establishing an
integrated framework “for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters,
coastal waters, and groundwater.” 62 In short, the directive seeks to achieve good
ecological status for all water bodies in the EU. The specific aims of the Directive are
multifold: to prevent further deterioration; to promote sustainable water use; to
progressively reduce discharges as well as the pollution of ground water; and to mitigate
effects of floods and droughts. Romania has committed to reaching a good state for 60% of
the surface waters, groundwater, and protected areas by December 2015 (i.e., fifteen years
after the adoption of the directive), with potential derogations through December
2021/2027 under justified circumstances, based on Article 4 (4) and 4 (5). Annex V of the
WFD 2000/60/EC provides detailed indicators for assessing the status of a particular body
of water.

219. Achieving 2018 EU targets will be hard. Assuming that all commitments under the
national investment programs will be carried through, there remains a funding gap of
around EUR 13 billion. Taking into consideration investments taken on by regional water
companies, local administrations, and public administrations, the funding gap would go
down to around EUR 10 billion. Furthermore, EU fund allocations (OP Large Infrastructure
and PNDR) for 2014-2020 for water and wastewater investments amount to around EUR 3
billion. This leaves an “optimistic” funding gap of around EUR 7 billion, which would have to

investments, or PPP arrangements. A similar figure was estimated by EBRD in a study they
have done for the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (see figure below).The
EBRD started from the premise that around EUR 7.1 billion of needed investments have or
will be covered through SOP Environment 2007-2013, the execution of ISPA Funds
(Instrument for Structural Pre-Accession), investments done by regional water companies,
as well as other grants and loans.

Coordination and Harmonization
220. Coordinating investments in water and wastewater is rather difficult, and th is for
several reasons. The main ones are discussed below.

Large investments needs require a mix of funding sources
221. The investment needs in the sector are large, requiring inputs from a variety of
sources. The larger the investment needs, the more stakeholders and funding sources need
to be identified to help address those needs. This of course brings significant coordination
issues with it. The difficulties are doubled by the fact that investments in water and
wastewater infrastructure, particularly those in rural networks, tend to be small in size,


                                                                                                           110
requiring rather high transaction costs and the involvement of multiple parties (e.g. , a
donor or managing authority, a local public administration, the county administration, the
regional water company).

Coherent regional approaches are needed
222. Regional Water and Wastewater Master Plans have been devised to guide
investments in infrastructure in the sector, but these are unfortunately not always
followed. To ensure that investments in water and wastewater infrastructure are efficient
and effective, it is important to have a clear plan. For example, an investment in a
wastewater treatment plan may not be financially viable in a village of 1,000 people, but it
may be viable in a cluster of villages of 3,000 people. In this sense, the regional water
masterplans have defined feasible water systems (e.g., a water main pipe that could service
an entire region) and wastewater agglomerations and clusters, which would ensure
economies of scale and the sustainability of the new investments.

223. Particularly for investments in wastewater systems, it is critical to have a regional
approach. In this sense, the European Council Directive 91/271/EEC on Urban Wastewater
Treatment defines an agglomeration as an “area where the populati on and/or economic
activities are sufficiently concentrated for urban waste water to be collected and
conducted to an urban waste water treatment plant or to a final discharge point.” It is also
recommended that wastewater investments be focused on agglomerations of over 2,000
people equivalent, as these are more likely to ensure the financial and operation efficiency
of the new systems. A cluster is a system of such agglomerations.

224. Since agglomerations and clusters do not always coincide with the administrative
boundaries of a territorial unit, they make the coordination of investments quite difficult.
For example, an agglomeration may include localities from different territorial
administrative units (UAT), requiring these actors to coordinate investments in the
wastewater system across jurisdictions. What happens in practice, however, particularly for
investment projects that cater directly to territorial administrative units (such as PNDL,
PNDR, or the Environment Fund) is that projects are designed and implemented at the
locality level, rather than at the agglomeration level. Usually, only investments that are
carried out by the regional water company, or investments where the regional water
company is the beneficiary, focus on agglomerations and clusters.

225. Going forward, it is important to ensure that investments in water and
wastewater infrastructure follow the provisions of existing regional master plans.
Moreover, although all people in Romania should be able to have access to such basic
infrastructure, a priority should be given to those localities and agglomerations that help
achieve EU Accession Treaty targets by 2018 – i.e., localities and agglomerations with more
than 2,000 people equivalent.

226. Consequently, the first step in coordinating different investment programs is to
ensure a focus on localities and agglomerations of over 2,000 people equivalent. In the
case of water systems, these could also be done in localities with more than 50 people, but
at least in the short term, the focus should be on agglomerations of more than 2,000




                                                                                        111
people equivalent. In the case of wastewater systems, no investments should be funded for
agglomerations of less than 2,000 people equivalent.

227. It is also important to identify a coherent approach for funds allocation b y region.
For example, EU funds are allocated by regional water systems, whereas funds allocated
through the PNDL are allocated to counties. While in a large proportion of cases regional
water systems coincide with the counties, there are a number of exceptions – e.g., the
Constanța-Ialomița region, the Cluj-Someș and Cluj-Arieș regions, the Sibiu and the Târnave
regions, the Deva and Valea Jiului regions. Since the focus is on integrated water and
wastewater systems, funds allocation should ideally be coordinated territorially.

Responsibilities should be clearly defined
228. While regional water operators are the main players in the operation and
maintenance of water and wastewater systems, there are also systems run by individual
localities and by private companies. Ideally, all investments done in a new system should
be included in the regional intercommunity development association (ADI) and the
operation and maintenance of the facility should be taken over by the regional water
company. This does not always happen in practice. Some mayors prefer to invest in
individual systems that they run independently. They do this because the water and
wastewater tariffs they charge are lower than that of regional operators. However, these
lower costs are misleading, because the costs with the operation and maintenance of these
systems are often rolled over under a different accounting category. For example, the
personnel in charge with maintaining a water treatment station may in fact show up on the
books as staff of the City Hall.

229. Investments done independently by localities are also not always financially and
operationally sustainable. Often, territorial administrative units design individual systems
that do not follow the proposals of the regional master plans, and when these systems are
finished they end up working sub-optimally. It also happens that systems are developed
without ensuring that a large enough number of people will actually connect to them once
completed. In many areas, the service is too expensive and people prefer not to connect. In
some situations, the water and wastewater systems developed by localities do not follow
basic EU guidelines (e.g., proper chlorination of water) and as such do not help achieve key
targets – not to speak of the potential health hazard they pose. Lastly, there are situations
where localities invest in wastewater systems without having a water system in place, in
the hope of using the finalized wastewater system as a bargaining chip to get a water
system funded too.

230. To ensure a coherent and coordinated approach to water and wastewater
investments, it is important that regional water operators play a key role throughout the
process. Ideally, investments through the sector should either: be run through the regional
operator; be run through a locality but then handed over to the regional operator for

Prioritization and evaluation/selection criteria and harmonization with selection
criteria applicable to EU-funded projects
231. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” proposes a
number of steps for selecting water and wastewater projects. These criteria are included
below. Both the coordination steps and the prioritization criteria discussed here are subject
to change by the MRDPA at a later date, keeping in mind that some of the EU programmatic
documents – including, most notably, general and specific Applicant Guides corresponding
to each operational programme – are not yet final at the time of this report’s writing .

232. The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for water and wastewater
projects across different regions in Romania (in most cases, these “regions” covered by
Regional Water Operators cover only one county). This follows the current PNDL model in
that each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the program. T he
tables below, however, propose a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a
clear, specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.

233. The EU-funded investments in water and sewage infrastructure are made through
the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LIOP) 2014-2020 and through the
National Program for Rural Development (PNDR) 2014-2020. LI OP funds are allocated by
regions for pre-determined projects. With respect to PNDR, there is no regional pre-
allocation, any rural TAU being allowed to apply for this type of funding.

234. Once the funding is allocated between counties/“regions,” the next step is to
decide which specific projects should receive financing. The following tables include a
number of criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in water and wastewater,
respectively. This model can be applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding
the former, since the PNDL’s current project portfolio far exceeds available resources, the
criteria noted below can also be deployed to sort through existing projects and reach a
manageable portfolio size (by suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In
addition, the completion rate of an individual project can and should be taken into account
for decisions regarding which investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the
importance of this criterion in raking projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends on the
MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of the PNDL . As for new projects, these would only be
approved and launched if there is sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all
ongoing projects are accounted for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for
all subsequent years, through the project’s completion.

235. The projects that are funded through LIOP 2014-2020 are not chosen based on
selection criteria, but are pre-selected in each regional master plan for water and sewage.
Basically, at the level of each region, the master plan identifies a series of water systems
and a set of sewage agglomerations / clusters that are to be financed.

236. Regarding PNDR, the evaluation and selection criteria were prepared in parallel
with PNDL selection criteria. Some of these criteria (focus on human agglomerations with
over 2,0000 people equivalent, served population) were used both for PNDL and PNDR. In
the case of PNDR though, some additional criteria were proposed for a better project
selection.

 STEP 3 – Prioritization of wastewater investments

237. An Investment Guide for Water and Wastewater is delivered along with this
report. The guide presents the way in which the investments in water and sewage
infrastructure can be done in a complementary manner through several investment
programs with EU funding or from the state-budget. For instance, it is recommended that
PNDL funds should not be used for financing systems / agglomerations / clusters that are
funded through LIOP because LIOP systems are conceived in an integrated manner and use
EU grants, while PNDL investments are made in a focused manner, at the locality level.
Clearly, the proposals included in this investment guide help achieve the objectives of all
the investment programs that target this type of infrastructure.

Investment Needs
238. Investment needs in social infrastructure are hard to estimate. Social
infrastructure basically means thousands of buildings strewn all over Romania, in different
states of repair or disrepair. Moreover, the need for additional social infrastructure is best
known by local authorities and communities on the ground, and these needs are
continuously shifting. In the report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” a
methodology was developed for assessing potential investment needs based on the profile
of individual territorial administrative units. The results of that estimation are included in
the table below. The methodology is of course far from perfect, but it does provide a
starting point for thinking about ways to address issues in this sector.

239. The Ministry of Education, at the request of the MRDPA, is preparing a database
with key information on every school in the country. The MRDPA wants to use this
database to more accurately identify rehabilitation needs for existing schools. Once the
database will be functional, it will be easier to accurately estimate how much it would cost
to rehabilitate the existing school network. Of course, these estimates will still not include
the investment needs for new educational infrastructure (e.g., kindergartens or daycare
centers).

240. Similar databases should be elaborated for the other types of social
infrastructure. This way it would be easier to estimate investment needs across the board,
and once investment needs are known it will be much easier to prioritize and coordinate
investments.

Coordination and Harmonization
241. Coordinating investments in social infrastructure is relatively difficult, because of
the eclectic nature of the sector. Some of the relevant issues are discussed below.

Eclectic sectors with eclectic needs require a targeted approach
242. In the case of social infrastructure, specific needs may vary substantially from one
locality to the next and across different types of infrastructure. In one case there may be a
need to rehabilitate a classroom, in another case there may be a need for running water
and a proper sanitation system, and in yet another case there may be a need to fix the roof
and install a heating system. Similarly, one locality may be in need of rehabilitating an
existent health clinic, whereas another locality would require that a clinic be built to begin
with.




                                                                                              120
243. The eclectic nature of social infrastructure makes coordination of investments
rather tough. This is why EU-funded programs coordinate their investments by focusing on
specific sub-sets. For example, the ROP 2007-2013 focuses on Category A Cultural heritage
sites in rural areas, while the PNDR 2007-2013 has allocated funds for the rehabilitation of
Category B Cultural heritage sites.

244. For the 2014-2020 programming period, a similar approach will be taken. For
example, it is most likely that the ROP 2014-2020 will focus on professional and vocational
high-schools and on kindergartens and nurseries. Similarly, the PNDR may focus on a
particular type of social infrastructure. Once the respective programmatic documents and
the applicant guides will be finalized, it will be easier to assess how different national
programs could better coordinate their interventions in social infrastructure.

Investment needs in social infrastructure are manageable given available resources
245. Investment needs in social infrastructure are estimated to be relatively limited,
and local authorities have more of their own resources to tackle existent challenges in
this sector. For example, every locality receives a transfer from the central budget to cover
teacher’s salaries and to pay for needed operation and maintenance costs of existing
educational facilities. The funds for operation and maintenance do not always cover needs
fully, but they do give localities more financial autonomy than in the case of other sectors
(e.g., communal roads).

The danger of crowding out EU funds should be minimized
246. Social infrastructure investments can be financed from three key investment
programs: the ROP, the PNDR, and the PNDL. In addition, localities and county councils
allocate funds from their own budget for the rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
social infrastructure. Whenever possible, local authorities should rely on EU funds to
address existing needs. Also, they should use their own resources, to the extent possible, to
solve key issues. PNDL funds should be used only as a last resort.

Prioritization and evaluation/selection criteria and harmonization with selection
criteria applicable to EU-funded projects
247. The report on “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” proposes a
number of steps for selecting higher impact social infrastructure projects. These criteria
are included below. Both the coordination steps and the prioritization criteria discussed
here are subject to change by the MRDPA at a later date, keeping in mind that some of the
EU programmatic documents – including, most notably, general and specific Applicant
Guides corresponding to each operational programme – are not yet final at the time of this
report’s writing.

248. The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for different types of
social infrastructure across different counties in Romania. This follows the current PNDL
model in that each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the
program. The tables below, however, propose a significant improvement over the status
quo by setting a clear, specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of
funds.



                                                                                          121
249. PNDL allocations at the county level were made based on estimated needs. The
allocation of EU funds at the county level was made by programs. Thus, considering ROP
2014-2020, pre-allocations were made for regional hospitals in Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, and
Iași, while regional allocations based on the region’s population and area were made for
educational infrastructure, cultural and heritage infrastructure, and county-level local-level
health infrastructure. Considering PNDR, the allocation is national for the educational
infrastructure and for the cultural heritage.

250. Once the funding is allocated between counties, the next step is to d ecide which
localities should receive financing within each category of social infrastructure (i.e.,
education, health, etc.). The following tables include a number of criteria for prioritizing
and selecting investments in these various types of social infrastructure. This model can be
applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the former, since the PNDL’s
current project portfolio far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also
be deployed to sort through existing projects and reach a manageable portfolio size (by
suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In addition, the completion rate
of an individual project can and should be taken into account for decisions regarding which
investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion in raking
projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of
the PNDL. As for new projects, these would only be approved and launched if there is
sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all ongoing projects are accounted
for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent years, through
the project’s completion.

251. The PNDL selection criteria for social infrastructure were prepared in parallel with
the evaluation and selection criteria pertaining to ROP and PNDR. At the moment of
writing this report, the ROP evaluation and selection criteria for educational infrastructure
and health infrastructure are not in place yet. With respect to PNDR, the selection criteria
for educational infrastructure are similar, both PNDL and PNDR taking into consideration
the population and the development degree at the TAU level. In the case of PNDL, this
program includes a series of criteria that are ignored by PNDR (e.g. school aged population)
and that would enable a more rigorous project selection. Regarding the cultural
infrastructure, there is a very significant accordance between the two sets of criteria used
in the case of PNDL and PNDR (e.g. tourist potential, social and cultural activities,
population, local human development index). The criteria used by ROP for the evaluation
and selection of cultural heritage projects are rather general and need to be assessed by an
external evaluator.

252. An Investment Guide for Communal Roads and Social Infrastructure is delivered
along with this report. This guide presents in detail the way in which state-budget
investments and EU-funded investments in social infrastructure could be made in a
complementary and harmonized way. Thus, with reference to educational infrastructure,
kindergartens, nurseries, technical high schools and vocational schools were mapped
separately, these being eligible for funding under ROP and PNDL. Regarding health
infrastructure, outpatient departments, hospitals and integrated community centers were
mapped, as these are eligible for funding under ROP. PNDR does not finance health
infrastructure projects. With respect to cultural infrastructure, Class A and Class B
archaeological and architecture monuments were mapped. Class A monuments in urban
and rural areas are eligible for funding under ROP 2014-2020. Considering Class B
monuments, those located in urban areas are eligible for funding under ROP and those
situated in rural areas are eligible for PNDR funding. The cultural centers were also mapped,

as they are eligible only for PNDL funding. Sports infrastructure is eligible for funding only
through state-budget programs.

253. Investment priorities were included for all types of social infrastructure. Such
prioritization can be used by all investment programs – both state-budget-funded and EU-
funded – and may lead to a complementary approach concerning these programs and the
achievement of common objectives. For example, regarding PNDR, the objective of cultural
infrastructure funding is the following: “Harnessing local cultural heritage, rural tourism
promotion, thereby improving living standards in rural areas” . The financing of educational
infrastructure through PNDR has the following purpose: “ Improving living conditions for the
rural population and stopping the phenomenon of depopulation in rural areas by reducing
rural-urban disparities”. Referring to ROP, the goal of funding educational infrastructure is
the following: “Increasing participation in early education and compulsory education,
particularly for children at risk of early school dropout”. The objective attached to health
infrastructure funding under ROP is the following: “Improved access to community health
services and secondary level services, particularly for poor and isolated areas”. Finally, the
ROP objective with regard to the funding of cultural heritage infrastructure projects is the
following: “Boosting local development through conservation, preservation, and promotion
of cultural heritage and cultural identity” . Clearly, the investments promoted through PNDL

Chapter 7: From Theory to Practice: The PNDL 2015
254. While work on the design and financial allocations of the PNDL 2015 was ongoing
at the time of this report’s writing , several intermediary and final outputs had been
completed in time to be taken into consideration by the MRDPA. In particular, the final
report on Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State-Funded investments in
Romania’s Infrastructure , the final report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL
Projects, and the intermediary version of this report were available for the MRDPA’s
consideration in the design of the PNDL 2015. The following analysis shows that the
technical staff of the MRDPA has taken several recommendations on board. Also, multiple
interviews with Ministry staff have revealed what they considered useful, what they
ultimately implemented, what they are considering for future years, and what is more
difficult to adopt and why.

255. In what follows, the PNDL 2015 is discussed in detail, based on the data available
publicly on the MRDPA’s website .63 The program is, in fact, a good practice example in the
Romanian context: every year, once the budget is approved and the MRDPA completes the
final allocation by county and by project, the Ministry publishes the list of interventions
financed in fiscal year 2015 (“active” projects). The PNDL is thus compared to the PNDL
2014 (for which there are also data posted on the MRDPA website), and it is analyzed from
the perspective of the recommendations made in the reports mentioned above.

Multiannual Implementation Timeline and Budgeting
256. The shortcomings of an annual investment program have been discussed in detail
in the report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects and are also addressed
in the following chapter on multiannual budgeting. These challenges become even more
visible when one looks at how the PNDL was implemented in 2015. In essence, in July 2015,
when this report was drafted, the PNDL had yet to disburse any funds to sub-national
projects. Virtually, half of the year was wasted preparing a list of projects that would
receive funding in 2015. With a multiannual implementation framework, the PNDL could
have technically started disbursing in January 2015.

257. With a year-on-year implementation approach, several months are lost every
year preparing an eligible projects list. A multiannual implementation framework would
eliminate the need for preparatory work at the beginning of every year. This work would be
done only once, at the beginning of an implementation timeline, with the financing of
ongoing works continuing unabated from year to year. New projects would be accepted for
funding only to the extent that projects in the existing list are finished, and to the extent
that there are sufficient resources to cover these new projects (not just for the first year,
but for their entire implementation timeline).

258. Fortunately, the MRDPA understands the limitations of an annual system and is
now considering adopting a multiannual implementation framework, discussing this

possibility with the Ministry of Finance. The MRDPA has also asked the World Bank to
provide more insights on potential multiyear budgeting approaches, and the next chapter
of this report is dedicated to this topic.

259. Given that multiannual implementation frameworks are used for EU-funded
operational programmes, they could certainly be used for state-budget-funded
investment programs – even with existing legislative and institutional restrictions. Most
importantly, the PNDL funding cycle should be coupled with the EU funding cycle, to the
extent possible. Having the same implementation timeline is one of the simplest and at the
same time most effective coordination and harmonization tools. The same implementation
timeline means that priorities can be decided together, investment priorities can be carved
out between different investment programs, and the implementation of projects on the
ground can be coordinated more efficiently.


Budget Allocation for 2015
260. The report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects argued that in
2015 the Ministry of Finance should allocate a similar amount as in 2014, with a small
increase made possible by the overall growth of the economy and by the rising inflation.
Indeed, the PNDL budget allocation for 2015 was at around RON 1.6 billion, similar to what
was estimated by the Bank.

261. Unfortunately, the sum that was allocated for the PNDL 2015 was not the sum
that ended up being available, according to MRDPA representatives interviewed. Because
of an accounting error, RON 0.5 billion that were not spent in 2014 did not get rolled over
into 2015, but rather were transformed into a budgetary credit and taken out of the 2015
PNDL budget. Thus, the actual PNDL budget available for investments in 2015 is only RON
1.04 billion.

262. This could have been avoided if a multiannual implementation framework was in
place, with a credible and functional commitment that funds can roll over into future
fiscal years when needed to complete infrastructure investments. For EU-funded
programs, undisbursed sums are routinely rolled-over from one fiscal year to the next. Of
course, the current situation is also a testament to the broader budgetary planning
challenges in Romania (described in depth in the following chapter), which continues to
suffer from weak capacity and lack of will to implement a clearer, more predictable system.


Budget Allocation by Counties
263. The report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects recommended
that funds allocated to individual counties should be based on actual needs. In 2014, each
individual county was allocated roughly the same amount, regardless what the projects
implemented in that particular county were , regardless of the county’s development level,
and regardless of how much of the financing could be covered from own sources (e.g., a
wealthier county has more to spend on infrastructure from the budgets of local authorities
themselves, and hence, ceteris paribus, would need less support from the central
government).


                                                                                      132
264. The PNDL 2015 made a differentiated budget allocation for each county. By and
large, as can be seen in the table below, the PNDL 2015 county allocations follow the
allocations proposed as part of this technical assistance, in consultation with the MRDPA.
There are, however, multiple counties where the allocation for 2015 differs markedly. For
example, Botoșani and Cluj have received significantly less funds than what was proposed
by the Bank - around 11-12 million RON less. On the other hand, counties like Bistrița -
Năsăud, Constanța, and Iași have received significantly more – around 11-16 million RON
more.

265.      One can speculate over why this situation exists, but some causes include:
         The allocation by county is made based on what the counties request individually.
          Some counties may simply request less than what they could receive, or perhaps
          the counties that received more “dared” to ask for more, in the hope that they
          would be granted at least a share of that.
         Bargaining power varies from county to county, with some having significantly
          more clout in the dialogue with central authorities, for a variety of reasons.
         A clear formula for county-based budget allocation continues to be lacking. As long
          as there is no clear formula for the allocation of funds by county, the allocation
          process is likely to include a greater dose of subjectivity.

266. The county allocation proposed as part of this technical assistance follows a clear
formula which takes individual county needs into consideration. The allocation formula is
presented in detail in the report on Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects. This
can be institutionalized through a simple Order by the MRDPA Minister, and it could be
used for a more objective allocation of PNDL funds over a longer implementation period.
Again, this would help boost the program’s predictability and, hence, th e ability of central,
county, and local authorities to coordinate investment programs and projects better. It is
also easier to communicate to potential beneficiaries (e.g., local authorities) and the
general public how the allocation works, based on a specific and transparent formula.

Funding Allocation by Priorities
267. One of the key recommendations of this technical assistance was to have clear
priorities identified for the PNDL, with the budget allocations by sectors taking into
account those priorities. The PNDL 2014 funded basically all kinds of project proposals that
came from the sub-national level, without requiring a prioritization of limited funds based
on the most important needs. As a result, a large share of funded projects represented
projects that were easy for sub-national authorities to write – e.g., communal roads (with
over 45% of PNDL 2014 funds going to such projects). The report on Improved Project
Prioritization for PNDL Projects recommended that the PNDL allocate funding based on
actual needs on the ground, demand from sub-national authorities, and EU-level priorities.
The recommended split is included in the table below, along with a comparison with the
actual sectoral allocations of PNDL 2014 and PNDL 2015.

268. While the PNDL 2015 does not have a clear budget split by priorities, allocated
funds are closer to what the technical assistance has proposed, with a smaller allocation
for communal roads and a larger allocation for social projects. The MRDPA has triaged
communal road projects, with a focus on works with a high completion degree, based on
interview data. Also, the program finances more social infrastructure projects (particularly
new educational infrastructure projects, with numerous new ones added for financing). In
line with what the technical assistance recommended, social infrastructure was the only
sector where new PNDL projects were accepted. For the other sectors, the focus was
largely on projects that had already been started.

269. Somewhat problematic is the fact that the allocation of funding for water and
wastewater projects appears lower than it should be, particularly given the needs in the
sector. As explained before, Romania has made specific commitments and it is far from
reaching set targets on water/wastewater service coverage (at agreed quality standards).
Even more problematic is the fact that a significant number of these PNDL projects are
investments that should not be financed, as will be discussed in the next section. In fact, it
may be that the relatively low budget allocation for water and wastewater projects is due
to the low quality of projects in the existent portfolio. Since the PNDL 2015 focused
primarily on financing ongoing projects, it could not achieve significantly improved project
selection outcomes. Thus, if the projects in the existent portfolio were not the best, the
PNDL 2015 is financing sub-optimal projects in this sector. Ideally, the “bad” (unfeasible,
unsustainable, etc.) projects from the current portfolio, particularly those with a low
completion rate, or projects that have not been started at all, should have not received any
additional funding.

270. Lastly, it should be noted that the current PNDL split by sectors is done for a
budget that is 33% lower than what it normally should have been. Thus, in absolute terms,
the allocation for social infrastructure projects is close to what the technical assistance
proposed, while the allocations to the other sectors are lower.


Prioritization of Projects
271. One of the key tasks that the World Bank has had in this assignment was to
recommend, in consultations with the MRPDA and other stakeholders, a way of
prioritizing PNDL investments and ensuring their coordination and harmonization with EU



                                                                                         135
investments. To this end, a set of prioritization criteria are devised taking EU selection
criteria into consideration. These proposed PNDL criteria have been discussed extensively
with the MRDPA and relevant stakeholders at the central, regional, and at the local level. A
look at the PNDL 2015 database indicates to what extent these prioritization criteria have
actually been used.

272. The MRDPA has indicated that the proposed prioritization criteria were used in
the selection of PNDL 2015 projects, but other criteria were used as well. Most
importantly, the Ministry gave higher priority to projects that had a higher completion rate,
with the intent of finishing more projects in a timely fashion. Given that this criterion was
used as the main triage tool, several projects that were otherwise considered non-priority
actually made it on the PNDL 2015 project priority list.

273. Around 46% of PNDL 2015 projects are part of the priority list of projects
identified as part of this technical assistance. These represent around 50% of the total
value allocated for the 2015 fiscal year. At the same time, around 40% of the projects, with
around 36% of the total allocated value for 2015, are considered non-priority by this
technical assistance. In essence, this means that in the initial project portfolio of around
4,000 projects there were other projects that should have received funding before these
979 non-priority projects. The fact that these interventions are considered non-priority
does not necessarily mean that the projects should not be financed. Often, local authorities
know their needs much better than central authorities and can make a clear case for why
they have chosen one project over another. However, the large number of non-priority
projects does indicate that the prioritization criteria proposed were not fully taken on board
in the triage of the existing PNDL portfolio and in financing decisions for 2015.

274. Around 14% of PNDL 2015 represent investments in non-priority sectors . These
refer to, on the one hand, sectors that, based on the findings of this technical assistance,
should not be the focus of the PNDL. These include investments in tourism infrastructure,
city hall buildings, or communal markets. On the other hand, non-priority sectors are those
for which it is difficult to devise clear prioritization criteria (e.g., investments in bridges and
investments in local town roads), which add up to 64% of the total funding dedicated to
non-priority sectors. The need for investment in bridges is usually determined on a case-by-
case basis (e.g., where a flood has destroyed an existing bridge), while the investment
needs in local roads (particularly in smaller towns and municipalities) are harder to assess
through a simplified general prioritization mechanism. Towns and municipalities vary


                                                                                              136
substantially in size and financial capacity. As such, PNDL funds for road infrastructure
should primarily target rural areas. Having a clearer focus of the PNDL on a few key sectors
will enable a more efficient and impactful allocation of MRDPA funds going forth, and it will
also help the Ministry better coordinate PNDL interventions with other EU and state-funded
programs.

275. In addition to non-priority projects, there are 367 investments (out of a total of
2,429) that should not be financed based on the findings of this technical assistance.
These largely represent water and wastewater projects inherited from previous investment
programs. The key reasons why such projects should not be financed include the following:
    - Wastewater projects are implemented in localities with less than 2,000 people
        equivalent, or water projects are implemented in localities with less than 50
        people. Such investments are considered to be inefficient from an economic and
        financial point of view, and they do not help with achieving EU acquis targets in the
        water and wastewater sector. Ideally, all wastewater and water projects financed
        by the PNDL should focus on water systems and sewage agglomerations/clusters
        with more than 2,000 people equivalent.

     -   The projects are part of a system/agglomeration/cluster that will receive priority
         funding under the OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020. Obviously, if EU funding is
         available for a particular investment, it should be sought firstly. PNDL funds should
         ideally target projects that are not eligible for EU funding, or projects that are
         complementary to EU funded investments. The Ministry of Finance recently took a
         similar position publicly. 64

196. It is important that for the 2016 financial exercise some of the lessons from the
current exercise be internalized to enable enhanced coordination and harmonization of
interventions – and, hence, higher development impact. Ideally, the PNDL should focus on
finalizing a triaged version of the current project portfolio, with a particular attention paid
to projects with a high priority score, while at the same time identifying potential solutions
for the projects that should technically not be financed by the PNDL. For example, water
and wastewater projects that could technically be covered by OP Large Infrastructure 2014-
2020 should be funded from this OP. The same goes for county roads and social
infrastructure that can be financed by the ROP 2014-2020. All this comes back to the need
to improve coordination among investment programs and projects in Romania. The
recommendations put forth in this series of reports promise to deliver higher predictability
and transparency, not just for the PNDL, but for all state-budget-funded instruments that
will consider adopting them. The MRDPA has begun taking some steps in the right direction
with the 2015 programming of the PNDL, but in truth a lot more can and should be done to
promote effective coordination among investment programs and a more strategic project
selection and prioritization process.

Chapter 8: Spotlight on Multiyear Budgeting as a Tool for
Coordinating Investments
276. In response to the MRDPA’s interest in the topic and upon its request, this
chapter focuses on multiyear budgeting as a tool to enhance the coordination and impact
of the National Local Development Program (PNDL) and similar programs. Providing an
exhaustive analysis of how multiannual budgeting could work and what it would require in
the Romanian context is beyond the scope of the current assessment. In fact, the World
Bank’s governance experts are currently working with the Ministry of Public Finance (MPF)
on a full-fledged assistance to that effect. The purpose of this chapter is more narrow and
specific to the main audience of this work. It seeks to orient the MRDPA on multiyear
budgeting and help define its potential role in this reform effort, including a discussion of
implications for programs like the PNDL. 65

277. But why discuss multiyear budgeting to begin with, especially in the context of
this report? First and foremost, a multiannual framework for the PNDL would facilitate
coordination with other investment programs, particularly those funded by EU structural
funds, which operate on a seven-year programming period, with an additional three years
for completing project implementation. In addition, adopting multiannual budgeting in
Romania would grant a much-needed higher predictability to multiyear investment
programs, as a solution to the current problem of ever-expanding project portfolios. Once
started, an investment would be guaranteed the necessary funds through completion, as
opposed to the current practice of putting ongoing investments on hold to start new ones,
without ensuring that the required funds are set aside from one year to the next. Equally
important for the topic at hand, coordination is impossible without reasonable certainty
regarding the timely implementation and completion of projects. Otherwise, a school may
be ready before the road in front of it is paved, a county road may be ready before a
highway it is supposed to connect to, and the funds for a communal road may be available
but cannot be deployed until the corresponding water/wastewater project is completed.

278. Such preliminary arguments suggest that the are several advantages to
implementing a multiyear PNDL – and adopting a multiyear budgetary framework more
broadly. The following sections cover these topics: (i) the theory behind multiyear
budgeting; (ii) Romania ’s current multiyear budgeting framework; (iii) future options for
multiyear budgeting in the context of the PNDL and beyond; and (iv) conclusions.

279. The full implementation of multiannual budgeting for investment programs like
the PNDL requires a substantial effort from many players, with the Center of Government
(Prime Minister’s Chancellery) and the Ministry of Public Finance playing leadership roles.
Keeping in mind the need to triage and rationalize its large project portfolio, as well as the
broader benefits of multiannual budgeting in Romania, the MRDPA has the potential to
become a key driver of needed reforms. This is not to say that the country is starting from

  Given the intended aim of this report, the approach taken and language used are simple (non-
technical), clear, and as accessible as possible to broad audiences.




                                                                                             139
scratch. As later shown, the legal framework for multiyear budgeting exists to a certain
extent, but requires strengthening and refining.

280. The reasonable expectation is that changes will not happen overnight and the
process of implementing multiannual budgeting fully will require 3-5 years, based on
what has happened in other countries . Indeed, success would require many elements,
including: specialized expertise and organizational capacity; enhanced program and project
monitoring systems and IT platforms; and, perhaps most challenging, a shift in mentalit y
from an annual to a multiannual budgeting process, including a sufficiently high level of
credibility regarding budgetary commitments from one year to the next. The final section of
this chapter discusses these obstacles in greater depth.


Multiyear Budgeting: A Theoretical Case
281. Budgeting refers to the process of allocating limited available resources to
maximize benefits resulting from public spending. 66 In theory, an all-knowing government
would estimate revenues perfectly and then allocate resources across sectors and
institutions in the way that produces the highest possible positive effects for everyone. In
practice, of course, there are many variables that affect the process and outcome of
budgetary planning, including: institutional and personal dynamics; political changes;
limited available information; unforeseen events such as sudden economic downturns; etc.
It is not uncommon to picture the budgeting process as an annual negotiation among line
ministries and the Finance Ministry, where the power balance among parties often weighs
more in how resources get allocated compared to a fully objective process, informed by
data and set priorities.

282. Several interchangeable terms refer to the same basic process of planning a
budget over several years: multiyear/multiannual budgeting; medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF), most often used in technical and scholarly circles; and “fiscal -
budgetary strategy,” in Romania’s context (more details follow in the next section).
Whatever the preferred term, multiyear budgetary planning is a core element to MTEF. The
trend to move to MB started in the 1980s and, by the end of 2008, more than two thirds of
countries in the world had adopted some form of a MTEF. In Eastern Europe, the reforms
only started after 2000, in most cases. As argued in the 2013 World Bank report “Beyond
the Annual Budget: Global Experiences with Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks,” the
causes for this movement toward MB are two-fold: in poorer countries, this often
happened under pressure from donors; advanced economies (OECD members), by contrast,
adopted MB to enhance budgetary planning, better prioritize expenditures, and improve
government performance (particularly in the context of high fiscal deficits in the early
1990s). 67

283. Conceptually, there are two different approaches to budgetary planning: bottom-
up and top-down. In “pure” form, the two are completely opposed. In bottom-up
budgetary planning, line ministries and other spending agencies formulate requests for
resource allocations from the central budget, often based on previous spending levels. They
typically ask for more every year, regardless of policy priorities or actual performance,
engaging in bilateral negotiations with the ministry of finance. Nearly always the total ask
across all spending agencies far exceeds the budgetary envelope, as each spending agency
is incentivized to exaggerate the needs for resources to ensure that there is room to cut, as
in a typical negotiation. By contrast, in a top-down model, the ministry of finance (and/or
the center of government) determines a total expenditure level for the entire government
before allocating resources to specific sectors/spending agencies. This calculation is based
on existing economic data and forecasts, and further the total expenditure is allocated to
individual sectors and sector ceilings are set (based on agreed policy priorities). Only then
individual appropriations are made, within the determined sector ceilings. 68

284. In practice, governments usually deploy both bottom-up and top-down elements
in their budgetary planning efforts – a top-down approach is usually informed by a
bottom-up analysis. Supporters of the latter rightly point out that governments must
ensure sufficient financing for critical functions or promised investment programs/reforms,
and such data can only come from spending agencies themselves. At the same time, a top-
down approach starts from setting the total expenditure level, which puts a heavier focus
on fiscal sustainability issues. It is also true that a stronger top-down system makes
coordination somewhat easier: the negotiation process is anchored in clear ceilings (in the
aggregate and for each sector), allowing spending agencies room for maneuver, as long as
they stay within the agreed caps. Under such a model, the budgetary planning process
includes multiple key steps: 69
               Set the overall expenditure ceilings. This is the result of ideological (i.e.,
                small vs. big government), technical choices (macroeconomic and fiscal
                forecasts, borrowing capacity, etc.), and timing (need to cool down or
                stimulate the economy). The two key inputs are economic forecasts and
                fiscal targets.
               Allocate resources to each sector and set sub-ceilings. This is the result of
                political agendas and priorities; there can be no universal recipe for the
                optimal allocation of funds. At the same time, final allocations need to take
                into account fixed expenditures and funds committed already, and also
                respect the set ceilings. Usually this stage is time-consuming and involves
                complex negotiations among government members.
               Prepare the detailed budget for each spending agency. Ceilings limit the
                total funds that can be spent by, say, a line ministry. Within those

                   constraints, however, each actor can then allocate resources in the best
                   way possible to reach policy objectives for that particular sector.

Box 4. Setting sector allocations and ceilings in Sweden

     Sweden sets an overall ceiling every three years, for a budget structured into 27 expenditure areas.
     The policy priorities are discussed at a cabinet budget retreat (held for two days in mid-March every
     year), where budget ceilings are also set.

     Interestingly, all negotiations have to happen during the retreat and decisions on resource
     allocations are always collective. A minister who is asking for an increased allocation for an
     expenditure area must convince all others to make a corresponding cut in their proposed budgets,
     thereby maintaining overall expenditure levels under the agreed aggregate ceiling. By mid April of
     every year, a final budget proposal is presented to parliament.

                  Pass the budget through parliament . At this step in the process, it is
                   important to ensure that parliamentary decisions do not alter radically the
                   established ceilings (for example, by requiring that any proposed increases
                   in appropriations be accompanied by proportional decreases, possibly
                   under the same sector’s ceiling) to ensure fiscal discipline and
                   sustainability.
                  Execute the budget for the current year and, when needed, begin
                   preparations for next year’s budget.

285. With respect to multiannual budgets specifically, there are three levels of MTEF,
varying in complexity and requiring different levels of government commitment and
capacity.70 Countries around the world are at different stages in this typology.
             Medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). This is the most basic form of
               multiannual budgeting and involves only defining overall and sector-
               specific budget ceilings. It is fully top-down in nature, focuses on allocating
               resources for inputs, and holds institutions accountable for staying within
               agreed spending caps.
                  Medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF). This includes top-down
                   elements of the MTFF, but also bottom-up considerations to determine the
                   resource needs of spending agencies. MTBFs are still heavily input-oriented
                   and only track outputs/outcomes in rare instances. Put differently,
                   spending agencies are still held accountable for the use of inputs.
                  Medium-term performance framework (MTPF). This mixes again top-down
                   and bottom-up elements, but the core focus is on programs and their

                     outcomes – not on the institutions that manage these resources. MTPFs
                     require strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity, and hold
                     spending agencies accountable for their actual results.
Box 5. Good practices at different levels of the MTEF
      Medium-term fiscal framework
         - Debt and deficit targets are established using model-based debt sustainability analysis,
            taking into account constraints imposed by policy rules.
         - Revenue forecasts are based on revenue department or other tax and non-tax receipt
            models.
         - Independent macroeconomic forecasts are used, and fiscal forecasts are subject to scrutiny
            by an audit office, fiscal council, or similar consultative body.
         - Aid commitments are covered by debt sustainability analysis and revenue forecasts.
         - The Ministry of Finance (MoF) issues a background paper on macro-fiscal objectives to
            inform budget decision making and form part of the budget documentation.

      Medium-term budgetary framework
         - The MoF issues a budget strategy paper describing the macro-fiscal framework and
            providing a broad indication of national development and budgetary priorities for the
            medium term.
         - A budget circular is sent to spending agencies outlining the basis on which they should
            prepare their medium-term budget requests. This circular indicates the availability of
            budget resources, usually in the form of provisional agency or program expenditure
            ceilings, and the aggregate cost assumptions to be used, including changes in inflation and
            public sector pay.
         - The budget requests of spending agencies reflect strategic objectives, the cost of current
            and new activities, expected cost recovery, and other relevant factors.
         - Final expenditure ceilings are reflected in the annual budget submitted to the legislature
            for consideration.
         - Spending agency budgets are finalized, and sector strategies are revised to reflect budget
            realities.
         - Spending agency budgets and sector strategies are published.

      Medium-term performance framework
         - Sector strategies discuss program outputs, outcomes, and performance.
         - Agency output, outcome, and performance indicators are used to establish budget targets.
         - Spending agencies report on results relative to targets. Comprehensive spending reviews
            are conducted periodically.

At the end of 2008, there were a total of 132 countries with some sort of MTEF system
implemented, as follows: 71 with MTFF (stage 1), 42 with MTBF (stage 2), and only 19 with
MTPF (stage 3). 71 Numbers in all categories have increased dramatically compared to 1990,
when only nice countries were at stage 1, only one was at stage two, and another one was

at stage three. Romania is at stage 2 currently, at least at a de jure level; the next section
explains this in greater detail, discussing the benefits and limits of the current law for fiscal
responsibility (Law 69/2010).

286. MTEFs can vary in terms of coverage and level of detail – as a general rule, more
comprehensive is better, though care should be exercised in micromanaging spending
agencies.72 It is typical to start with a central government MTEF, i.e., covering only the
national level and its transfers to subnational governments. In countries with a highly
decentralized structure, lower levels can be encouraged to develop their own MTEFs, given
that a single framework at the national level will only include limited expenditures. The
more programs are covered under the MTEF, regardless of the source of financing, the
better the framework at serving aforementioned purposes (predictability, fiscal discipline,
prioritization, etc.). Moreover, it terms of level of detail, MTEFs should – to the full extent
possible – break down expenditure allocations for each spending agency to promote full
accountability (e.g., even large programs that cut across ministries should be split clearly
between each actor). The Ministry of Finance should refrain from setting or requiring
ceilings at multiple levels within spending agencies, i.e., micromanaging them. 73 As a
general rule, each institution should be granted flexibility in how it manages its resources,
as long as it meets set targets (in terms of spending and, ideally, also in terms of results).

287. An interesting good practice is to set different sub -ceilings for capital and
operational expenditures to prevent, in effect, budget transfers from capital
improvements to operational spending. This is the norm in the UK, for instance, where this
rule was adopted as a response to the natural tendency to cut investment resources, which
pay off in the medium-to-long run, when faced with budgetary pressures in the short run.
The next sub-section discusses the applicability of this principle in the Romanian context.

288. A typical timeline for MTEFs is 3-5 years, and different countries have more or less
flexibility in imposing hard expenditure ceilings. 74 It is common to start with the current
year’s budget for the first-year allocation, then have a fixed allocation for the second year,
and then indicative allocations for the other future year(s). Out-years roll forward each
year, with some potential adjustments in the eventuality of unexpected economic events of
other justifiable policy shifts (e.g., military conflict). The key to the entire framework is
setting clear and credible expenditure ceilings, usually based on forward estimates (i.e.,
projections of spending or actual multiyear allocations of resources). Some countries set
hard real or nominal ceilings for the entire duration of an MTEF (e.g., Denmark, the
Netherlands, Sweden), others are more flexible in adjusting targets – within reason – every
year. How do governments ensure that ceilings are followed? There is a wide range of
sanctions possible, ranging from top management changes to financial penalties and
budget cuts. It is considered a good practice to rely on realistic, solid estimates developed
by an independent third party (e.g., the Fiscal Council, in Romania’s case), though it is also
true that no forward estimates can be perfect. Therefore it is common to have implicit or

explicit margins: for the former, governments may use conservative economic forecasts; for
the latter, they may hold a contingency reserve (e.g., 2% of total expenditure in Chile,
Korea, and Sweden) at the central level or at each spending agency, or both. In case of a
budgetary surplus, the resources can be distributed to programs that require expansion,
based on clear arguments by spending agencies.
 Box 6. Chile's simple model for arriving at macroeconomic forecasts

     In Chile, there is an independent third-party institution (“the output gap” group) that produces
     macroeconomic forecasts. This panel includes 14 members, prominent economists, all appointed by
     the Ministry of Finance, with an even split between those identified as close to the ruling party and
     those identified as close to the opposition.

     The first panel meeting discusses and decides on the methodological aspects of the estimates. At
     the second meeting, panel members submit individual calculations and results. The 14 estimates are
     published, enabling each member to check his/her work. Finally, the two extremes are discarded
     and the final result is chosen as the average of the remaining 12 estimates.

     OECD, December 2005, p. 16-17

289. What about new policy initiatives? Having a MTEF does not preclude governments
from funding new programs, in line with evolving conditions and citizen needs. In countries
where the framework functions well, however, there is a clearly defined institutional
process for how to evaluate, select, and fund new initiatives. In countries like Sweden, any
increase in funding needs to be compensated by savings elsewhere; in other countries,
ceilings may be adjusted upon clear and solid justification. The typical model involves
setting up a committee that looks at new policy proposals and ranks them based on a
number of criteria, then the Center of Government, together with the Finance Ministry,
makes the final decision on what to finance. 75

290. Importantly, MTEFs have to function within a clear and legitimate institutional
structure. The optimal choice would depend on historical legacies and evolving conditions.
For instance, in countries where the Ministry of Finance is typically strong, it can take full
ownership of implementing a MTEF. In other cases, the Center of Government (Prime
Minister’s Office) is better suited for this role , with the Ministry of Finance playing a
monitoring role once everything is in motion. Regardless of the ultimate choice, one actor
needs to be clearly accountable for enforcing the general rules of a MTEF, and third-party
reporting on year-to-year actual performance versus targets can also play a fundamental
part (e.g., from a civil society organization, a fiscal council, or another independent body).

291.      All in all, multiyear budgeting offers multiple key advantages :
         First, it allows governments to focus on strategic priorities for longer time horizons.
          In fact, it starts with that: the Center of Government takes on a list of key priorities,

         setting allocations matching those priorities, and then executing on the agreed
         agenda. This is more efficient and effective than a purely bottom-up process where
         each spending agency makes the case for why it should receive more funds than
         before, and what happens in the aggregate is much more the result of bilateral
         negotiations with the Ministry of Finance than the outcome of a strategic
         prioritization effort.
        Second, it grants a higher degree of predictability to the process of allocating and
         spending public resources every year. Each spending agency can plan for longer
         periods of time, without fearing massive budget cuts under normal circumstances.
         Particularly for infrastructure projects spanning multiple years, this would enable
         decision-makers to ensure that investments, once started, are fully funded through
         completion.
        Third, it is more transparent across the entire cycle . Priorities are clearer, allocations
         have to match the priorities, and there is full visibility into how each spending
         agency is doing every year compared to set targets. Assumptions around
         macroeconomic estimates stand independent scrutiny.
        Fourth, data show that adopting MTEFs, in its various forms, helps with a number of
         key indicators. Specifically, countries with MTEFs are better at fiscal discipline
         (improved fiscal balance), allocative efficiency (i.e., lower volatility for how much
         the government spends and on what sectors), and technical efficiency (more cost-
         effective measures, i.e., more bang for the same buck). The World Bank has tested
         these hypotheses in multiple countries and the results are shown to be significant;
         as a general rule, the more advanced the MTEF, the better it is. 76

In this context, the next section explores the status of multiyear budgeting in Romania,
including recent progress, emerging challenges, and potential impact on the National Local
Development Program (PNDL).


Recent Developments in Romania
292. Multiyear budgeting is a relatively recent development in Romania . The first
elements were introduced in the context of the country’s EU integration effort: the Pre -
accession Economic Programmes (PEP) required the Government to introduce medium-
term budgetary projections as early as 2004. Following Romania’s accession, these
projections were introduced in the Convergence Programmes, submitted annually by the
Government to the EU and covering a period of four years (e.g., 2014-2017, 2015-2018,
etc.). 77 Of course, Romania also participates in and benefits from the structural funds
allocated by the EU as part of multiyear programming periods – i.e., 2007-2013, 2014-2020,
etc. There are clear multiannual budgeting elements in absorbing such funds. As in other
sectors (e.g., R omania’s rule of law reforms), the shift toward multiannual budgeting has
occurred as a direct result of explicit and/or implicit requirements at the EU level.

293. At the same time, it is important to note the culture of annual budgets has been
strong in Romania – partly because of legal and regulatory reasons, partly because of
mentalities. The Romanian Constitution itself stipulates, under Article 138, paragraph 2,
that “the Government develops the draft of the budget annually […] and submits it for the
Parliament’s approval.” 78 The word “annual” is explicitly included in the Constitution.
During field interviews, interlocutors in certain institutions, including in the Ministry of
Public Finance, have noted that this particular article is an important constraint against
adopting a full-fledged multiyear budgeting framework. Experts from civil society disagree
with this view, however, noting that the Constitution does not forbid the Government of
the Parliament to develop and approve a multiyear budget annually, rolling it forward every
year (as it happens in other countries too). The Law on Public Finances (Law 500/2002)
clearly states under Article 4 that multiyear commitments are to be translated into annual
commitments by each spending agency. For an investment spanning multiple years such as
a new bridge in a city, the City Hall writes up a contract with the contractor and, annually,
signs an addendum stipulating the sums available to be spent on that particular contract in
that given year.

294. The World Bank’s “Public Expenditure and Institutional Review” from February
2010 put a bleak diagnostic on the state of Romania’s budgetary planning framework at
that point in time. The report criticizes the lack of orientation toward policies and results,
due to a multitude of factors: weak strategic planning capacity, no independent oversight of
budget execution, and deficient accountability mechanisms. This translated into significant
variance between planned allocations and budgetary execution, with multiple amendments
over the course of a single year. Moreover, in early 2010, there was no “strategic,
multiannual planning” and there was only a weak linkage between policy objectives,
resources, and actual budgetary allocations. The management of the budget tended to be
ad-hoc, with major reallocations in the last few months of the year (the “November -
December” effect ). As the report notes, “multi-year expenditure targets are only indicative
and budget execution differs substantially from previous year’s programming, especially for
capital spending.”79 Indeed, the percentage change between actual vs. planned
expenditures for capital investments was over +45% in 2006 and -30% in 2008. This
seriously undermined predictability and transparency, contributing to the problem of
starting new infrastructure investments when funds are plenty or even exceed expectations
and stopping them (sometimes for good) when funds fall short. Unlike wages and other
sensitive budgetary chapters, capital investments are less rigid and, often, they play the
“pivot” role when balancing the budget.

295. Still, there has been some progress toward multiyear budgeting , mostly since
2010, when a much expected MTEF was put in place (also as a key recommendation of
the World Bank’s public expenditure review). The crux of this effort is the Law on Fiscal
Responsibility (Law 69/2010), the first comprehensive legislative act that introduced the
requirement for the government to develop a medium-term fiscal-budgetary strategy (FBS).

The FBS “sets the objectives and priorities in the fisca l-budgetary area, the targets for
revenues and expenditures for the consolidated budget and its components, and the
evolution of the consolidated budget for a period of three years.” 80 Based on interview data
with key stakeholders in government, academia, and civil society, the law is considered a
big step in the right direction, at least at a de jure level. It was spearheaded by a number of
experts from the Ministry of Public Finance, and it draws from good practices in other
countries that have adopted MTEFs.

296. The Law on Fiscal Responsibility defined for the first time several key elements of
multiyear and responsible, prudent budgeting in Romania. These included: objectives of
the fiscal-budgetary policy (e.g., prudency, predictability, debt sustainability, etc.); rules and
correction mechanisms, including the adoption of requirements resulting from the EU Fiscal
Pact (e.g., structural deficit of under 1% at Romania’s current debt level as a medium -term
objective – MTO); budgetary expenditures and revenues; a strict cap on the number of
budgetary amendments every year (maximum of two and none in the first six months of the
year); the general framework for the fiscal-budgetary strategy; a number of rules for
enhancing the transparency of budgetary policy (publishing regular reports, etc.); the Fiscal
Council; institutional responsibilities and sanctions.

297. The fiscal-budgetary strategy (FBS) is to be published and updated annually by the
Ministry of Finance before July 31, and features a number of projections and ceilings for
the upcoming three years. 81 Parliament approves the FBS and its proposed ceilings and can
formulate amendments/objections. Importantly, however, the law forbids adjustments that
would deteriorate targets for budget deficits or would increase expenditures beyond
approved ceilings (article 35, paragraph 1 of Law 69/2010). The ceilings for the total
budgetary deficit and for personnel expenditures are fixed/required for two years following
the publishing of the FBS; other ceilings (e.g., amount of loans contracted; public debt level;
sub-ceilings for budgetary components like social security, special funds, and others) are
fixed/required only for the following year. Other main components of the FBS include an
analysis of actual results for the two previous years of budgetary execution, assessment of
policies affecting expenditures and revenues, and a comparison of potential changes from
one FBS to the next. The medium-term expenditure framework, which is part of the FBS,
covers three main sections: priorities in terms of expenditures; expenditures for the 10
largest spending agencies and, in the aggregate, spending levels for local territorial
administrative units; and major public investment projects. Moreover, Article 30 of the
Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law 69/2010) requires the annual budget submitted by all
spending agencies (from local to central level) to follow the FBS or, if that is not possible, to
explain any deviations.

 Box 7. The Romanian Fiscal Council (Law 69/2010)

     The Fiscal Council (FC) is an independent authority with 5 members, who support the Government
     and the Parliament with developing fiscal -budgetary policies and with ensuring the quality of
     macroeconomic forecasts. The FC develops analyses and evaluations and formulates its own
     “opinions,” published on its website and also sent to v arious other institutions.

     The FC includes five members nominated by: the Romanian Academy, the National Bank of
     Romania, the Academy of Economic Sciences Bucharest, the Romanian Banking Institute, and the
     Romanian Banking Association. These are appointed by Parliament for a period of 9 years. The FC
     has its own budget and Technical Secretariat, under the Romanian Academy.

     Source: Law 69/2010


298. The FBS for 2015-2017 was finalized, approved, and published in December 2014,
and follows the structure defined by Law 69/2010. The MTEF defines ceilings for broad
budgetary chapters: total expenditures from the state budget; total expenditures for 10
ministries; personnel; goods and services; interest expenditures; subsidies; transfers;
expenditures for nonreimbursable and reimbursable projects; social assistance; loans, etc.
The ten large spending agencies included in the FBS are: the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry
of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Transport, the General Secretariat of the Government,
the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of
National Education, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Public Finance, and the
Ministry of Justice. Notably, the MRDPA is not included in the list of spending agencies for
which multiyear budgeting is defined, along with expenditure ceilings and sub-ceilings.

299. Where does all this position Romania with respect to the typology defined in the
previous section? To rule out one of the three options, it is clear that the country has not
implemented performance-based budgeting (stage III of MTEFs), though it is planning to do
so in future years, with World Bank assistance. The European Commission has developed
since 2006 the medium-term budgetary framework index, which evaluates countries
against five main criteria: (i) existence of a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF or
stage II in the typology presented earlier); (ii) connectedness between the MTBF and the
preparation of annual budgets; (iii) involvement of the national parliament in the
preparation of medium-term plans; (iv) existence of coordination mechanisms prior to
setting the medium-term budgetary targets; (v) monitoring and enforcement of
multiannual budgetary targets. 82 Romania scores the maximum possible (i.e., a two) on the
first, third, and fifth criteria, and is in the middle for the rest (scoring a one). This places the
country at a median score of 1.6 – after member States like France, Spain, the Netherlands,
Latvia, Greece, and Denmark, but ahead of countries like Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland, Hungary,
and others. At least based on this theoretical assessment, Romania can be placed squarely
at the second stage of MTEFs with a fairly solid medium-term budgetary framework.

Current Challenges of Multiyear Budgeting in the Romanian Context
300. In practice, however, multiyear budgeting in the Romanian context faces a
number of challenges that require nuancing the evaluation above. In 2011, the ceiling for
total budgetary expenditures was increased by close to RON 3 billion through an emergency
ordinance, despite the fact that the Romanian Parliament had passed the FBS in 2010 and,
alongside it, Law 275/2010 for approving certain ceilings and indicators. The Fiscal Council
noted at the time that it is “regrettable” that the Government decided to circumvent the
Fiscal Responsibility Law – beyond the provisions for permissible derogations, such as
unforeseen economic events – and this created a “dangerous precedent.”83 Since then, the
Government has repeatedly issued derogations from the Fiscal Responsibility Law: for 2012,
it adjusted upward the targets for personnel expenditures; in 2013, actual deficit targets
were readjusted upward (from 2.1% for 2013 and 1.8% for 2014 to 2.3% and 2.5%
respectively);84 and, in 2014, through GEO 74/2014, the Government allowed more than
two budgetary amendments for that year (even after November 30), through derogation
from Law 69/2010 and Law 500/2002.

301. The jury is still out on what can be done to limit the number of derogations from
the Fiscal Responsibility Law. On the one hand, it is fine to allow a certain degree of
flexibility – and Law 69/2010 does indeed stipulate several instances when it is permissible
to adjust set ceilings: adjustment in the scope of the general consolidated budget; the
significant worsening of the macroeconomic outlook; or a change in Government, whereby
the incoming cabinet has the right (but not the obligation) to issue a new FBS. On the other
hand, derogations from the law open the door to abuse and lack of predictability, and
ultimately defeat the purpose of a law on fiscal responsibility. A solution would be to
enshrine certain principles (e.g., a balanced budget or a deficit of no more than 1%) in the
Constitution, following the model of other countries. Another option, albeit weaker, is to
make Law 69/2010 an organic law, hence requiring a majority of members of Parliament for
any derogations (as opposed to a majority of those present). What is certainly clear is that
the political culture of accountability should be strengthened in Romania to enable the Law
on Fiscal Responsibility to become a solid norm, with derogations only pursued in truly
exceptional circumstances. 85

302. Another potential weakness of the current framework for multiyear budgeting is
the development of economic forecasts fully under the purview of the Ministry of Public
Finance. The establishment of a Fiscal Council was a positive step in this regard, though this
body has limited ability to shape budgetary planning. It can merely comment on projections
made by the Ministry of Public Finance. Elsewhere, stronger independent bodies like the
Austrian Institute for Economic Research or the UK Office of Budget Responsibility (separate
from the Treasury) directly provide the assumptions and estimates used in building out the
budget.

303. In addition, the World Bank’s functional review of Romania’s public finance
sector, finalized in October 2010, months after the establishment of Law 69/2010, called
attention to a number of other shortcomings. These include: the lack of a clear priority-
setting process by the Center of Government (e.g., by reinstituting the Cabinet Strategic
Planning Committee); the weak framework for assessing the fiscal impact of new
legislation, including the Ministry of Finance ’s inability to enforce the fiscal neutrality clause
of the Fiscal Responsibility Law; and the lack of strategic prioritization of expenditures. This
final report seeks to address precisely this latter category, in the context of local and
county-level infrastructure projects. There is a similar effort by another World Bank team
working with the Ministry of Public Finance to enhance the prioritization of national-level
projects (based on GEO 88/2013).

304. Three aspects of the current framework are particularly worth noting in the
context of this report:
     Review and improve the methodology for setting expenditure ceilings : In Romania,
       there is no systematic methodology for the estimation of expenditure
       requirements, which means that the ministry expenditure ceilings are to some
       extent arbitrary. This makes it difficult for the Government to insist that the ceilings
       be followed during budget preparation. As a consequence, they end up modified
       significantly during budget preparation, thereby undermining the basic aim of top-
       down budgeting. 86
        Separate baseline vs. new policies and projects: Budget requests from spending
         agencies, along with the FBS, should contain a separation of baseline funding
         required to continue existing policies and projects and funding requests for new
         initiatives. The same logic applies to investment projects, which should clearly be
         separated into ongoing and new commitments, ensuring that any additional new
         projects are only pursued if there is enough room in the total budget minus the
         resources committed to complete ongoing projects. The next section explores this
         in greater depth.
        Review baseline funding to identify saving opportunities: Just because something
         received funding at some point and continues to receive funding at present does
         not necessarily mean that it should continue. There should be a clear owner of
         monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions, independent of the spending agencies
         making the funding request. The other report on “Coordination of Strategies and
         Programs” (World Bank, March 2015), also submitted under Component 1,
         recommends that the Center of Government should take on this task.

     In Canada, the Expenditure Management System is the framework for developing and implementing
     the government's spending plans, and encompasses a number of elements and activities (e.g.
     planning, evaluation, etc.) that guide decisions on resource allocation. A key pillar of this system is
     the strategic review of spending programs. All institutions receiving central appropriations are
     required to undertake, at least every four years, a strategic review covering 100% of their direct
     program spending and operating costs of their major statutory programs. Spending agencies are
     required to identify reallocation options totaling 5% from their lowest-priority, lowest-performing
     program and can even identify more potential savings in order to provide a greater range of options.

305. In conclusion, Romania’s multiyea r budgeting framework is a work in progress.
The Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law 69/2010) has introduced a number of positive measures
that have instilled greater fiscal discipline, an enhanced focus on strategic priorities, and a
more predictable and transparent budgeting process. In practice, several shortcomings
persist: budgetary projections and set ceilings can suffer changes, which affects their
credibility and predictability; the fiscal-budgetary strategy does not clearly link priorities
and resource allocation, and, in fact, there is no set process for drawing specific national
priorities across all sectors; the fiscal impact of new initiatives is not always properly
evaluated and challenged, as mandated by law, by the Ministry of Public Finances. Last but
not least, Romania’s budget ary planning should take into account performance and results,
virtually moving to the next stage of the MTEF model. This is in fact a commitment made by
the Government toward the EC; for instance, in the Convergence Programme for 2015-
2018, a medium-term goal is “the implementation of multiannual budgeting based on
programs and projects, which would facilitate important savings and would increase the
predictability and efficiency of public expenditure.” 87


A Multiyear PNDL: Between Necessity and Feasibility
306. This section discusses the advantages of moving to a multiyear framework for the
National Local Development Program (PNDL), managed by the MRDPA. This pertains
primarily to local and county-level infrastructure projects, as explained in further depth
below. The main questions addressed are: is a multiyear PNDL needed and, if so, is it
feasible?

307. According to Law 273/2006 on local public finances, expenses for public
investments and other capital expenditures financed from local public funds have to be
integrated in the budget proposals of territorial-administrative units. The budget
proposals are developed by the credit release authorities and then approved by the
deliberative authorities. The Fiscal Responsibility Law requires all public authorities –
including subnational governments – to abide by the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy. At the same
time, only investment objectives that are entirely financed through multiannual budget
proposals may be included in public investment programs. The main credit authorities are

the mayors of the TAUs (including the general mayor of Bucharest and mayors of the
sectors) and the presidents of the county councils. 88

308. The main credit release authorities for local budgets elaborate public investmen t
programs annually. For each of the objectives, financial and non-financial information is
integrated. The financial information includes: the total value of the project; the
commitment appropriations; the budgetary appropriations; the funding schedule,
structured by sources and years, and correlated with the implementation schedule; the
cost-benefit analysis; and operation and maintenance costs. The non-financial information
should comprise: the investment strategy (including investment priorities and the
relationship between different projects, and the analysis criteria that determine the
introduction in the investment program of new objectives to the detriment of ongoing
ones); the description of the project; and the physical progress of the objectives.

309. The challenges of the current PNDL framework are well-known – in fact, all
investment programs financed from the state budget on an annual basis face the same
difficulties. As noted earlier, the lack of a multiyear PNDL leads to:
      Lack of prioritization: It is virtually impossible to prioritize programs and projects
         without having a clear sense of what the total available budget is. Since
         infrastructure projects, even of small and medium size, as is typical under the PNDL,
         span multiple years, there is an inevitable mismatch between the annual allocations
         of resources and the multiyear implementation timeline. This is also partly why the
         linkages between strategic priorities, financial allocation, and projects remain weak.
          Ever-growing project portfolios: Since financial allocations may change every year,
           decision-makers at the central level face political pressures from subnational
           governments to invest in new projects whenever possible. The hope of local
           stakeholders is that, once the project begins, they would find a way to persuade the
           Ministry to allocate the funds needed to complete the investment in future years.
           This logic has generated massive portfolios of active and inactive projects – the
           difference between them is that the former receive funding in the current fiscal
           year, while the latter do not. The “active/inactive” status is only applicable to one
           fiscal year – as noted above, things can change dramatically from one year to the
           next, particularly if there is a change in the ruling coalition. Recent Romanian
           history suggests that such changes can happen often.
          Implicit preference for small projects with limited impact : Given the annual nature
           of financial allocations for PNDL projects, applicants tend to submit for
           consideration small investments (e.g., short road segments) that typically cannot, in
           isolation, generate substantial benefits upon completion. Investments financed
           through PNDL 2014 were on average three times smaller than similar projects
           financed through the ROP 2007-2013 and PNDR 2007-2013. This is also related to
           an evaluation process that requires improvement, in line with the other
           recommendations made in this report.

        “Drip funding” has almost become the norm, not the exception : As noted earlier, at
         the end of 2014 there were around 3,950 projects contracted under the PNDL, with
         a total estimated value of about RON 22 billion. It will take more than 15 years to
         finish these projects with the financial allocation that the PNDL has received in
         previous years (assuming that no other new projects are financed in that time
         interval). This raises the cost of the construction (due to the time value of money,
         the need to conserve works and repair damages, the need to update technical
         documentation and permits constantly, etc.) and delays the benefits for the
         communities where projects are located. 89 Of course, “drip funding” is related to
         the practice of funding new projects in the absence of sufficient fiscal space – this
         inevitably constrains the resources available for ongoing investments.
        Lack of correlation with EU-funded projects: As stated repeatedly, EU-financed
         programs operate based on a multiannual framework – the “n+2” rule (or n+3, as
         the case may be) allows member states to design interventions and receiving
         funding over a period of seven years of programming, plus an extra three years for
         completing implementation and seeking reimbursement. Without a longer time
         horizon for state-budget-funded investments, it is very difficult to attempt to
         coordinate them with EU-funded projects. As a matter of fact, there is a risk of
         cannibalization: subnational governments that believe they would be able to attract
         sufficient funding through the PNDL may avoid applying for EU funds due to their
         added complexity and rigor.
        Suboptimal timing of resource allocation given the annual budgetary calendar :
         When there are excess resources available, projects may receive additional
         financing only in July, the earliest that a budgetary amendment can be introduced
         (by law). Contractors also need to submit final payment requests by November to
         make sure that they can get paid. This essentially reduces the period for
         construction to 4 months or less, keeping in mind that weather in the fall can be
         unfavorable.
        Complex and burdensome legal procedures: Spending agencies use multiannual
         framework contracts covering the total period of construction/acquisition, with a
         provision for the annual endorsement of addenda covering the value of work to be
         undertaken during that year. The legal requirements to make payments are
         concentrated in the annual contracts, not in the framework contract itself, allowing
         public authorities to tailor the work undertaken and corresponding payments to fit
         the annual appropriation available. There is actually a specific legal provision
         requiring public authorities to communicate to contractors at the beginning of each
         year the sum available for payment, thus helping them avoid performing more
         work than what the beneficiary can afford paying for. 90

For all these reasons, it becomes evident that adopting a multiyear framework for the PNDL
– not just at the level of programming, but also at the fiscal-budgetary level – is a key
necessity in the context of the MRDPA’s efforts to improve the program. In short, this
promises to deliver higher predictability, more transparency, improved efficiency of
spending, higher level of attractiveness for potential applicants and beneficiaries, and,
ultimately, more impactful projects.

310. On the question regarding the feasibility of a multiannual PNDL given current
legislative and policy constraints, there are more arguments in favor than against. For
one, EU-funded interventions currently “run through” the national budget and
expenditures get subsequently reimbursed; this suggests that it is possible to have
multiyear infrastructure investment projects even under the status quo constraints of
annual budgeting, provided that there is firm commitment to a clear annual budget
allocation. Moreover, the Romanian Law on Public Finances (Law 500/2002), even under its
current form, appears to permit multiyear budgeting. 91 Article 4 (5) provides that the
budget may include “multiannual commitments,” with these commitments defined by
Article 2 (14) as “amounts allocated to certain programs, projects, subprojects, obj ectives
and the like, which are carried on for a period longer than a year and give rise to
commitment credits and budgetary credits.” 92

311. Opponents of the views expressed above appeal to the “annuality” provision of
the Romanian Constitution and to the Fiscal Responsibility Law. This report explained
earlier that the Constitution does not forbid multiannual budgets, but merely requires an
annual approval process. There is nothing stopping the Government or the Parliament from
adhering to multiyear targets, which is essentially what happens under the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (though room for improvement definitely exists). At the same time,
Article 30 (2) of Law 69/10 notes that “preallocating sums from the budget with a special
destination to spending agenc ies or sectors is not permitted.” Again, this is a matter of
framing. A multiyear PNDL would not hinge on “preallocating” sums of money for multiple
years in a row, but it would need to take into account budgetary commitments spanning
multiple annual budgets. In other words, if the MRDPA’s budget for the PNDL is “X” for
2016, there could be no new projects started in 2016 if the total sum needed in 2016 for
financing ongoing projects exceeded “X.” The following paragraphs explain in depth how
this system would work.

312. The World Bank team currently assisting the Ministry of Public Finance has
identified concrete ways for introducing multiannual investment appropriations for
significant investment projects (as defined by GEO 88/2013) . 93 This report argues that the
same model could apply to local and regional-level infrastructure interventions of the PNDL
type (most of which would count as small or medium-sized). This is based on the dual

system of cash and commitment appropriations (the French model), as explained in the box
below.
Box 9. The dual appropriations system

      Romania’s Public Finance Law (Law 500/2002), through Articles 2 and 4, introduced the system of
      dual cash and commitment appropriations. Under this system, the annual budget law voted by the
      Parliament contains two types of legal appropriations of expenditures. The first is an appropriation
      for payments, which imposes a quantitative limit on the value of payments to suppliers, contractors,
      employees, etc. that a spending agency may make during the year. The second is an appropriation
      for commitments, which imposes a quantitative limit on the value of contractual obligations into
      which a spending agency may enter during the year, and which will require payments at some stage
      in the future.

      The principle of budgetary appropriations for commitments as well as for payments is of French
      origin. In France, appropriations for commitments have for a long time existed in r espect to
      investment expenditures. The so-called LOLF legislation of 2001 generalized the principle of
      appropriations for commitments to other categories of expenditure also (e.g., contracts for the
      supply of goods and services). Budgetary appropriations for commitments play the role of providing
      a legal basis for entering into contracts that will oblige the state to make payments in several years
      into the future – something that an annual payments appropriation cannot do (by definition).

      The two types of appropriation may be illustrated by the example of an investment project contract
      providing for the construction of a road over a period of three years (starting in 2015) at a total
      project cost of 15 million RON, with actual construction to the value of 5 million RON expected to
      take place during each of the three years. This would involve the following pattern of commitment
      appropriations (CA) and payment appropriations (PA):

      Year 2015 (n)
      CA: 15 million (corresponding to a contract signed covering the full three years)
      PA: 5 million (corresponding to the payment of the first tranche)

      Year 2016 (n+1)
      CA: 0 (no new contract is signed)
      PA: 5 million (corresponding to the payment of the second tranche)

      Year 2017 (n+2)
      CA: 0 (no new contract is signed)
      PA: 5 million (corresponding to the payment of the third and final tranche)

313. As explained in the reports prepared by the World Bank for the public investment
management technical assistance, the system of multiannual appropriations can mitigate
the risks of “drip funding,” excess ive and unsustainable project portfolios, and large
numbers of inactive investments that continue to incur costs . 94 The key is to include the

total project cost (TPC) within the multiannual appropriation of a particular spending
agency, reserving the sums exclusively for that particular project. In France, this blocking
(reservation) of the full amount is regulated by the LOLF legislation dating from 2001. 95 At
any point in time, the system reserves an appropriation equal to the portion of the
approved total project cost for which contracts have not yet been signed, but which will be
signed during the remainder of the implementation period. By contrast, line ministries and
other spending agencies in Romania do not reserve from their commitment appropriations
the remaining total cost of investment projects under their purview. Rather, commitment
appropriations are intended only to cover the value of contracts anticipated to be signed
during the year in which those appropriations are granted. There is thus no requirement to
also reserve within the commitment appropriation amounts that needed to cover contracts
expected to be signed at a later stage during the acquisition/construction process.

314. The figure below illustrates the example of a RON 500 million multiannu al
appropriation over five years for a highway project. In year 1, an initial multiannual
appropriation of 500 million is made, covering the TPC. Also in year 1 a contract is entered
into, involving a commitment of 300 million, leading to 3 separate payments to the
contractor of 100 million in years 1, 2, and 3. No other contracts are signed in years 2 and
3, so additional commitments during those years are zero. In year 4, the 200 million left
from the original multiannual project appropriation is finally committed in the form of a
second contract, which then results in 2 separate payments to the contractor of 100 million
in years 4 and 5. Nothing remains of the initial multiannual total project appropriation in
year 5, as the total amount had been contracted by year 4.

Note that in practice, at least for infrastructure projects, the contract for the full amount is
signed from the beginning. This does not change the main conclusions of the example

95
  Art. 9 of the law provides that the commitment appropriation is to cover the full costs of any
project that is complete (can be operationalized without the addition of further components).

presented. By including a second contract in year 4, the figure above merely makes the
point that, even in the absence of a contract, the remaining total cost is reserved from the
annual appropriations until the project is completed.

315. The system of multiyear appropriations, as described above, should ideally cover
the entire Romanian public sector, not just the MRDPA or the PNDL, and its successful
implementation depends on multiple factors. First, the multiannual appropriation
reserved for a particular investment has to only go to that investment; otherwise, the same
problems of drip funding and diverting money from one investment to another will
continue. Second – and related to the first condition – is to have a solid project monitoring
system, tracking at all times what the projects’ total cost is, what contracts are signed, and
when. Third, the total value of multiannual appropriations for a spending agency must be
clearly and credibly defined. This would require the fiscal-budgetary strategy and the
corresponding laws on approved ceilings to define limits specifically for multiannual
appropriations for each major ministry/spending agency (this is not the case, currently).
Under such a system, no new projects could be pursued unless extra budgetary room
becomes available for current and future years, equal to the new projects’ total cost. It
would thus be impossible to reshuffle projects within a ministry’s portfolio (or program,
like the PNDL), since each investment would have a clear, dedicated multiannual
appropriation. Last but not least, the system requires strong monitoring and evaluation
functions from both within and outside the MRDPA. The Ministry of Public Finance and
other control institutions (e.g., the Court of Accounts, the Audit Authority, etc. 96 ) should
monitor project allocations and, respectively, project expenditures, while the Center of
Government should regularly evaluate the performance of investment programs. 97

316. What would adopting this system of multiannual appropriations mean for the
PNDL? The MRDPA would have a set appropriation every year for expenditures related to
the program. For each individual project for which a financing agreement exists between
the MRDPA and a local/county authority, the MRDPA would block/reserve the total project
cost (for new projects) or the total remaining project cost (total project cost minus
expenditures paid in previous years, for ongoing projects) from the multiannual
appropriation. Each project in the pipeline would thereby be accounted for, transparently,
and the resources needed for its completion would be ensured every year. As argued
earlier, there should be different appropriations for the baseline (portfolio of ongoing
projects) and (possibly) the supplementary fiscal space (for new projects, if any). The

   Established by Law 94/1992 as an autonomous, independent institution, the Court of Accounts
(CA) is essentially the main auditing public body in Romania responsible for checking and reviewing
the management and spending of public money. Members of the CA are appointed by Parliament.
The Audit Authority (AA) performs the external auditing of non-reimbursable funds, including EU
money. The AA is a financial checking body attached to the CA, but with independent operations
from the CA. The AA monitors and reviews the EU-funded projects implemented by public and
private entities, ensuring that all expenditures made are consistent with the specific requirements
for each program. The AA is coordinated by a president and two vice-presidents appointed by the
Parliament from the CA members.

appropriation for the baseline is clear from one year to the next and equals the annual
remaining cost of finishing ongoing projects. At the same time, the supplementary fiscal
space results from a top-level negotiation and is, ultimately, the outcome of a political
decision. It is critical to note, however, that any new projects taken on in the current year
create fiscal implications and must be included in the baseline for future years.

317. The following illustrative example helps demonstrate how the sy stem would
work in practice for a simplified PNDL with only three projects and an implementation
period of 2016-2020.98 It is assumed that the PNDL will have the following set ceilings for
two main categories of expenditures: ongoing projects (from the baseline) and new
projects (from the supplementary fiscal space). Their sum is the total ceiling allowed for
expenditures under the PNDL for the timeline defined earlier (2016-2019).

 2017    90                     70                                       160
 2018    75                     90                                       165
 2019    60                     110                                      170

Now consider that the PNDL has three new projects, all starting from scratch in 2016. The
projects are supposed to make the following payments in each year:
                             Project 1    Project 2   Project 3 Total space required each yr.
 Year
                             (C)          (D)         (E)          (C)+(D)+(E)
 2016                        5            20          10           35
 2017                        30           30          10           70
 2018                        20           60          10           90

Then the impact of the three projects on the ceiling and the fiscal space remaining is as
follows:
         Updated baseline                           Supplementary fiscal space remaining for
 Year                                               that particular year
         (F)
 2016 100                                           15 (=50-5-20-10)
 2017 160 (=90+30+30+10)                            0 (=70-30-30-10)
 2018 165 (=75+20+60+10)                            0 (=90-20-60-10)
 2019 165 (=60+20+75+10)                            5 (=110-20-75-10)

It is important to note that: (i) the annual expenditures are blocked/reserved from the
beginning, for all four years, reducing the fiscal space available to take on other new

  The team would like to thank Victor Giosan for providing a similar example for how the model
could work in practice




                                                                                                 159
projects; (ii) expenditures are always below agreed ceilings, even when factoring into the
new baselines the costs of the three new projects; (iii) for years 1 and 4, there is a surplus,
which can be directed to other expenditures for that particular year (i.e., do not generate
expenditures in future years) or can be reallocated to other programs/spending ag encies;
(iv) by 2020, the PNDL completes the four projects and frees up fiscal space to be able to
pursue new investments. Of course, this is a simplified model, with only three new projects
– all new and all lasting for four years – and only two categories (baseline and new
projects). In practice, it is often a good practice to maintain a small contingency to cover
unexpected costs in a given year and have at least some flexibility.

318. There are several key advantages to the proposed system in the context of the
PNDL and beyond:
     First, it addresses the major challenge of ever-expanding project portfolios, limiting
       the number investments to a sustainable level and promoting budgetary discipline.
       This is particularly important for a program like the PNDL, which had close to 4,000
       active projects in its portfolio (i.e., received financing in 2014), plus probably
       thousands more inactive/suspended investments. A precondition for this to work is
       to rationalize and sort through the project portfolio, as argued in the next sub-
       section.
        Second, it incentivizes the MRDPA – and, by implication, project beneficiaries at the
         local and county levels – to complete projects in a timely manner. An incomplete
         project continues to block resources from the approved appropriations, thereby
         limiting the ability of the PNDL to fund new projects. Only by finishing a project can
         the Ministry free up the space required by new investments it wants to pursue.
        Third, it is more predictable. Not only does the Ministry of Finance know how much
         to allocate every year, with a reasonable certainty that funds will actually be
         expensed, but the MRDPA also knows what it can and cannot do within the set
         ceilings. The predictability rolls down the process chain further: local
         administrations know which projects get financed and, roughly, when they can be
         finished, and contractors know that they will get paid for the work performed.
        Last but not least, the system’s transparency would increase significantly. At any
         point, it is clear how much is needed to complete all projects that are underway,
         thus avoiding the dangerous illusion that splitting available payment appropriations
         between more projects creates additional fiscal space. 99

Recommended Action Steps for the MRDPA
319. As noted earlier, the MRDPA can only do so much to enable the adoption of a full
multiyear budgetary framework in Romania, but there are a series of steps in can take in
this direction:
       Ask to be included in the fiscal-budgetary strategy from 2016 onward. Currently, it
        is not one of the ten ministries that is covered by this framework, which means that
        there are no ceilings defined for the main categories of expenditures.
       Help drive forward the evolution of multiannual budgeting in Romania toward a
        focus on programs and results. As the manager of the largest state-funded program
        for local and county-level infrastructure (the PNDL), the MRDPA is uniquely
        positioned to work with the Ministry of Public Finance and support its efforts to
        adopt program and performance-based budgeting. The Ministry of Public Finance is
        currently exploring a potential path forward in this respect, with World Bank
        assistance. Pilot ministries may include the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of
        Education, but the MRDPA could also express interest to be among the first
        institutions in the country to adopt performance-based budgeting.
        Recommendations on M&E mechanisms for the PNDL – included in the report on
        “Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State -Funded Investments in
        Romania’s Infrastructure” (World Bank, April 2015) – could help operationalize this
        effort.
       Work with the Ministry of Public Finance to promote the establishment of ceilings
        and multiannual appropriations for baseline capital expenditures and new
        investment projects. Again, the current system does not make this distinction,
        which is critical for having a functional model of strategic prioritization of a limited
        number of projects.
       Develop a system for project- and program-level monitoring in real time . An IT
        platform is needed to monitor the large number of projects in the PNDL portfolio
        and know, at all times, which stage they are at, how much money they are
        absorbing, and whether they are on track or face delays. The same database would
        also capture the multiannual requirements of each project in the portfolio, making
        sure that the total costs are properly reflected in the available budgetary envelope.

320. At the same time, the MRDPA can proactively institute a de facto multiyear PNDL.
This can be pursued regardless of how the broader fiscal-budgetary framework evolves,
although it would certainly make things easier to also have de jure changes that would
move the entire public administration in Romania to a multiannual system. In any case, the
MRDPA should consider taking the following measures:
       Conceptualize what the PNDL could look like through 2020 – essentially the time
        interval matching the EU programming period. This is a first step to greater
        internal discipline in allocating resources to PNDL projects and, in fact, does not
        depend on the Ministry of Finance formally adopting the model presented above.
        All that is needed is sufficient commitment by the MRDPA to stick to a certain split
        in the funding allocated to the main sectors under the PNDL. The report on
        “Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects” has proposed a multiannual


                                                                                           161
       budget for the PNDL for the 2014-2020 programming period of around RON 13
       billion RON – or EUR 2.8 billion. This budget takes into consideration budget
       allocations for 2014, assuming that the resources available for the program will be
       at least at that level, in the context of a growing economy with a positive outlook.
       Several scenarios were discussed for the proper allocation of this budget by
       individual sectors. The table below includes this proposed allocation. 100

         Next, the MRDPA should rationalize the PNDL portfolio based on budget
          constraints. Again, the current portfolio would take over 15 years to complete,
          assuming that 2014 funding levels would hold going forward. The rationalization
          should therefore be done for each sector by: (i) deploying the sector-specific
          criteria (e.g., those listed in chapters 4-6 of the current report); and (ii) considering
          project completion status, with more advanced works taking priority. Some
          investments will have to be put on hold, others will have to search for alternative
          funding (e.g., EU funds), and others will have to be canceled. While none of these
          options is politically easy, there is no other way to stopping the practice of “drip
          funding” and to enhancing the efficiency and impact of PNDL funds.

         The MRDPA should further set the PNDL baseline (for the budgeted year and for
          the programming period). This would cover all ongoing investments that passed
          the test (i.e., remained in the portfolio) in the previous step. All these projects
          should be finalized according to their implementation timeline (without intervening
          on the portfolio of ongoing investments to exclude some projects and/or introduce
          new ones), budgeting properly based on costs expected for each year. If there are
          doubts related to anticipated costs, a careful review of projects in the portfolio
          should be undertaken to preempt high volatility in budgeted vs. expensed costs.

         The MRDPA should consider new investments separately from ongoing projects
          and only when allowed by the available budget envelope . New investment
          projects should be funded exclusively by the difference between the total PNDL
          budgetary allocation (budgeted year and programming period) and the PNDL
          baseline (as defined above). These projects would be prioritized according to the

                                                                                                   162
       sector-specific criteria in this report. For all new projects accepted, the
       corresponding planned budget allocations must be included in the PNDL baseline
       for future years, as explained in-depth in the multiyear appropriations model
       included above.

      The MRDPA should also design and adopt a clear legal procedure to follow if the
       PNDL budgetary allocation is smaller than the PNDL baseline . This may happen for
       different reasons: e.g., budgetary austerity, change in government priorities, etc.
       There are mainly two alternatives under this scenario: (i) a proportional cut for all
       investment projects included in the baseline, with the price of delaying the
       completion date for all; (ii) allocation of the available funds to investment projects
       according to their evaluation/selection scores or based on costs required for
       conserving ongoing works (ongoing projects would thus be classified as “active/in
       implementation” and “paused”). Whatever the ultimate solution, if the allocation is
       smaller than the baseline then the new investment project submission would be
       suspended until there are funds to cover all ongoing projects (including “paused”
       ones) and any excess could be allocated to brand new investments.

      The MRDPA should strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms to
       make necessary corrections in the financing and implementation of the program
       promptly.

       At the program level:
           o The PNDL should set performance indicators for the entire program (e.g.,
               number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for each
               sector (length of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with
               access to water and sanitation, etc.). This would enable M&E mechanisms
               based on actual results, and the Ministry of Public Finance would also have
               a key role to play in verifying periodically that indicators (particularly
               financial ones) are on track.

                                                                                        163
    o As for program evaluations, the government should conduct independent
      impact assessments of completed projects. It is recommended that these
      tools be deployed by third-party auditors – one option would be to have
      the Prime Minister’s Chancellery deploy a cor e team of in-house or hired
      experts to evaluate whether programs have indeed generated positive
      development effects through output and outcome indicators (based on a
      sample of projects). Some simple indicators such as, in the case of running
      water projects, the number of people connected or the number of people
      connected who are regularly paying their bills, could tell a lot about the
      quality of the design of some programs and their opportunity cost. The
      impact assessments could then be used to further refine the policy
      framework for relevant investment programs and should be made public.
      Currently, there are no systematic efforts to carry out impact assessments
      of state-budget-funded investment programs and there are no public,
      transparent evaluations of such instruments.

At the project level:
    o A proper monitoring is the first step in enabling the MRDPA to correct
      issues promptly as they develop during the project implementation phase.
      Currently, the system is based on simple desk reviews of submitted
      documents, as there are no continuous mechanisms for verifying the works
      on the ground. This is critical in terms of providing a constant flow of
      information regarding how projects are advancing, how much funds they
      would require at different stages in their implementation, where delays are
      accumulating and why, etc.
    o For its part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall program
      monitoring role, with specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on
      a defined methodology (e.g., as mentioned earlier, larger/more complex
      projects should be more carefully scrutinized). In addition, the MRDPA
      could rely on a more active involvement by county council representatives,
      as well as on independent auditors. It is highly recommended to implement
      a standard electronic reporting system, easily accessible by all local
      authorities, who should be incentivized to gradually move away from hard-
      copy report submissions. This would enable faster processing and real-time
      monitoring of progress.

And, finally, for the post-implementation phase:
   o In particular with respect to financial indicators, the MRDPA should collect
        and assess all relevant information (e.g., number of projects, disbursement
        vs. planned allocations, etc.). This would enable the Ministry to engage in a
        strategic dialogue with the Ministry of Public Finance and other
        stakeholders and, if need be, have the arguments and the data to persuade
        them to expand the PNDL. This would be particularly useful during the
        negotiations for increases in budgets from one year to the next or even
        during the course of a single year (if excess resources become available).



                                                                                164
Of course, the reality is that multiyear budgeting will work best in the PNDL’s case if it is
implemented in correlation with a broader reform effort at the level of the Ministry of
Public Finance (MPF). The MRPDA should pursue the above-mentioned actions while
coordinating closely with the MPF to ensure that progress is both significant and durable.

Chapter 9: Spotlight on Territorial Contracts as a Tool for
Coordinating Investments
321. Based on the experience of other countries, territorial contracts between national
and sub-national entities hold the potential to become a very powerful tool for both
vertical and horizontal coordination of investments in Romania . Different countries have
different names for this: contracts, agreements, pacts, etc. This is not to be confused with
contracts for individual projects between, say, a Ministry serving as the Managing Authority
of an EU-Funded program and a local authority as beneficiary of the grant. Territorial
contracts involve stakeholders from public, private, and nonprofit sectors, usually at a
regional level. They include a vision for that particular territory, with goals, activities
(projects), and performance (output, outcome, and impact) indicators. They can be purely
transactional, driving financial allocations through a series of positive incentives and/or
sanctions (e.g., the Netherlands); or relational, trust-based. Most importantly, territorial
contracts have the potential to account for both state-budget and EU funds, setting priority
projects and “dividing them up” between financing sources of various kinds.

322. In the Romanian context, territorial contracts would help mitigate the high
volatility of strategic investment priorities. The basic thinking is to “lock in” subnational
and national stakeholders from a particular region/county/territory, for a defined period of
time (e.g., equal to the EU programming cycle of seven plus three years), on a list of clearly
defined infrastructure projects. Why is this critical? Recent experience in Romania suggests
that political changes happen often and also bring about shifts in strategic priorities. As
such, projects are started and not always brought to completion. Territorial contracts would
help on multiple dimensions:
     First, territorial contracts would offer an opportunity to bring stakeholders together
         – across party lines and across sectors (public, private, and nonprofit) – and
         establish a list of priority projects for an entire programming period.
       Second, they would be perceived as stronger accountability mechanisms compared
        to other existing documents (e.g., development strategies). They could have specific
        sanctions for potential breaches, penalizing those parties that decide to deviate
        unilaterally from set priorities.
       Third, territorial contracts would follow a clear format, requiring subnational and
        national authorities to think through a list of priority projects, but also potential
        funding opportunities and parties accountable for implementation. Certain complex
        interventions often involve local, county, and national bodies. This framework
        would help define, from the start, who is responsible for what.
       Fourth, by setting a more stable list of priorities, territorial contracts would reduce
        the risk of “drip funding” and starting more projects than financially sustainable.
        Because the list of priorities could not change with every election cycle or even
        more frequent episode of political instability, the financed projects would likely be
        carried forward through completion.
       Finally, this tool would enable authorities across administrative levels to nurture a
        culture based on partnership and collaboration. This experience can become
        particularly valuable in a context where ever-more-complex projects require public
        actors to be increasingly creative and collaborative – not just across administrative
        levels, but also across sectors.

323. For all these reasons, the aim of this chapter is to explore the possibility of
introducing territorial contracts in Romania. The MRDPA, as the ministry responsible for
public administration reforms, is ideally positioned to spearhead this effort. The first part of
this chapter presents an overview of the agreements between local and government
authorities in different European countries to highlight good practices and experiences,
presenting the types of contracts used in Spain, Italy, and Sweden. The second section
reviews the Polish model of Regional Contracts and the more recent Territorial Contracts, as
the main planning tools aimed at supporting and improving regional development policies
in the country. The same section also includes a summary of the contract for Podlaskie
region. The last section of this chapter looks into the opportunity of designing and
implementing territorial contracts in Romania, covering some of the institutional and legal
changes required. Finally, the same section presents a brief scenario regarding a contract
for Bihor County (chosen to illustrate a potential pilot).

Good Practices of Regional Agreements in Europe

1. Convenios de colaboración in Spain
324. In Spain, coordination between autonomous communities and the central
government is done through agreements and co-financing frameworks. Local communities
receive money from both the central and local budget through a mixed of taxes, tax-sharing
arrangements, and transfers negotiated in a multilateral forum. Local communities get
transfers from the central government for capital expenditures through equalization
funding and convenios de colaboración (cooperative agreements). Convenios de
colaboración were introduced in 1984 to run structural policies in order to manage
interdependence among policies and mitigate the strong antagonism following the
decentralization process under which autonomous communities have received significant
powers.

325. A convenio de colaboración is a bilateral agreement signed between an
autonomous community and the central government of Spain under which both parties
undertake a number of obligations and responsibilities pertaining to a project . Through
convenios autonomous communities get earmarked funds for each type of investment, be it
state-budget-funded or entirely financed by EU funds. These agreements play an important
role in regional development, and influence the long-term strategic planning of regions.
Through these bilateral agreements the central government maintains some leverage on
the development of the regions and can ensure coordination with cross-regional priorities
and projects. Convenios are negotiated on a sectorial basis between a region and different
ministries.

326. These agreements cover investments of general interest, such as airports, roads,
and waterways crossing more than one autonomous community, thus addressing the
issue of horizontal coordination among multiple territorial units. For example, convenios
signed between the Galician regional authorities and the central government target a wide
area of interventions. In 2010, for instance, most of the funds assigned by the central
government to Galicia targeted investments in environment, rural, and maritime affairs
(17%), education (14%), health and social policy (12%), industry, tourism & trade (11%),
culture (11%), and development (8%). Less money went to projects covering justice,
defense, and territorial policy and public administration (between 5% and 6%). Although
interventions under convenios are actually coordinated by the central government,
oftentimes regions and municipalities contribute financially to the projects (especially for
water investments.

327. The Spanish legislation is quite limited when it comes to regulating convenios de
colaboración and allocation of funds based on such agreements. There is a set of general
rules providing a great deal of flexibility to these agreements. C onvenios cover a certain
period of time and can be extended automatically or by signing another convenio.
Negotiations for convenios are very transparent to the public. The agreements are
published in the Official Bulletin of the central government. There is a monitoring
commission for each convenio, responsible for solving problems regarding the
interpretation and non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. If the monitoring



                                                                                       169
commission fails to solve the problems, then the matter is taken to the courts dealing with
administrative conflicts among levels of government. The disagreements over distribution
of competences between the region and the central government should be sorted out by
the Constitutional Court of Spain.

328. Except for the Basque Country and Navarra, the Spanish autonomous
communities sign tens of agreements with the central government every year. For
example, in 2010, there were 59 convenios signed on average per region. The number of
agreements increased dramatically, from only 14 in 1984 to over 800 by 2004. In recent
years, the regions improved their bargaining stance during negotiations for future
investments. Starting with 2011, a new rule reads that convenios breaching the budget’s
stability will be subject to a binding report issued by the Ministry of Economics and Finance.

329. The allocation of funds depends on current transfers . The amount of money
transferred from the central government to the regions increased after 2007, but it went
down sharply in 2010, in the context of the global economic crisis, which hit Spa in
particularly hard. At the same time, the co-financing share of autonomous communities for
investments covered by convenios went up, from 24% in 2007 to 47% in 2010.

330. As a case in point, the convenios signed between Galicia and the Spanish
Government helped the region to perform quite well compared to other autonomous
communities in the country. Galicia has a large number of convenios; only in the past few
years the region has signed 65 agreements. One of the major investments under way in the
region is the construction of the high-speed railway (Alta Velocidad Española - AVE)
between Madrid and Galicia. 101 The AVE line was prioritized by the central government. The
project has a total value of EUR 2.2 billion of which half is covered through EU funds, and
there is also a large contribution from the central government. A top priority for the
Galician authorities, the project is part of the region’s strategic objective of improving the
connection between Galicia and the rest of Spain.

331. Other agreements cover the transport and water sectors. For example, a convenio
was signed in July 2014 between the Ministry of Environment, Land, and Infrastructure and
the Galician Agency for Technological Modernization for a road management system of
mobility of public transport, with a total value of EUR 2.2 million. EUR 810,000 was
allocated by the Ministry and the rest was co-financed by the Galician Agency. 102 Another
convenio was signed in August 2014 between the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and
Environment and the Government of Galicia for the development of a new wastewater
treatment plant and collection in Ribeira. 103 It is an investment worth EUR 30 million, co-
financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economy through ERDF and the Board of Galicia

through Aquas de Galicia, the regional water company. The new wastewater treatment plan
will cater to over 32,000 people by providing a complex process of wastewater treatment in
the towns of Ribeira, and some communities in Aguiño, Ameixida, Revuelta, and Castiñeras.

332. There are also some convenios dealing with smaller projects . It is the case of the
new center of the arts in Verin, developed under an agreement signed between several
stakeholders: the Ministry of Environment, Land and Infrastructure, the Ministry of Culture,
Education and Universities, the Galicia Tourism Agency, the Ourense County Council, and
the County of Verin. 104 This EUR 3.3 million project is partly funded through the 2007-2013
Operational Program ERDF Galicia, with a contribution from the other parties to the
agreement.

2. Accordi di Programma Quadro (APQs) in Italy
333. Italy employs a participatory form of territorial development planning and
contractual forms of multi-level governance. The instrument of contractual cooperation
was implemented for the first time in the mid-1980s, and is based on the British culture of
public-private partnership and the French state-regions planning agreement. The first two
tools used in Italy for a contractual form of cooperation were the Accordi di Programma
Quadro (APQ – Framework Program Agreements). These were designed to address three
well-known issues at the time: the bureaucratic complexity, inaction, and delays in the
decision-making process. By mid-1990, these types of agreements evolved to negotiated
programming. They act like strategies seeking to coordinate development policies by
involving various public and private actors under a complex decision-making and a unified
management of financial resources.

334. The regional development policy in Italy is implemented based on contract s
signed between regions and the central government . APQs are the main instruments for
planning the so-called “additional” resources for regional development (in addition to their
own financing sources). APQs are signed between central and regional authorities and
cover interventions mutually agreed by the two parties. The APQ framework is established
under the Institutional Program Understanding (IIP – Intese Instituzionali di Programma),
which is the main structure for planning national additional resources in Italy. IIP was
established between 1999 and 2001 in order to help with the coordination between the
central government and regional authorities in defining objectives for specific areas of
interventions and implementing local infrastructure development projects.

335. APQs are signed by the region, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and other
relevant public institutions, depending on the type of project. An APQ is signed for each
project. The document has an annex describing the project, making sure that it is consistent
with the given programming tools in the region. APQs can cover infrastructure investments
in transport, cultural heritage, human resources, local development systems, and water and
environment. APQs are operative programming instruments that allow immediate

implementation of the proposed investment. They stipulate actions and methods of
implementation, point to the entities responsible for project execution, indicate the funding
framework, and ensure monitoring of implementation. Under APQs, responsibilities and
commitments are assigned to each signatory party. The agreements also include litigations
and reconciliation procedures between parties.

336. Interventions are financed from different funding sources, such as ordinary
resources, additional national funds dedicated to underdeveloped regions, and EU and
private funds. Ordinary resources are released from the central budget to regional or local
budgets of some regions – typically, the poorest ones. These underdeveloped regions
receive 15% additional funds for development. Additional national funds are disbursed
annually in order to strike an economic and social balance between different areas in the
country. APQs are also funded through EU operational programs for Northern, Southern,
and Central regions. Private funds are usually used for infrastructure investments that have
the potential to generate substantial revenues. Regions must submit project proposals to
the Ministry of Economy. Every six months, parties responsible for the implementation of
the APQ must send a monitoring report to the Joint Committee of Agreement describing
the project implementation status. The reports should flag critical and financial issues and
indicate solutions.

337. Since 2003, significant funds were released from the Fund for Underutilized Areas
(FAS – Fondo per Area Sottoutilizzate). Money is allocated by the Inter-ministerial
Committee for Economic Programming (CIPE) based on specific resolutions that identify the
projects’ beneficiaries and set the rules they must comply with. 50% of the money covering
all APQs in Italy comes from national and regional ordinary resources, 23% from the FAS,
while the rest comes from EU funds or private investors.

338. Italian regions and autonomous provinces received EUR 23 billion d uring the
2000-2006 programming period . Approximately EUR 18.6 billion was allocated through
APQs. 85% of the overall funds went to the Southern regions – in the most underdeveloped
areas of the country. 105 Between 2005 and 2006, all funds covering the APQs amounted to
15% of the total capital expenditures in Italy. Between 1999 and 2007, 567 APQs were
signed for 17,000 projects with a total value of nearly EUR 74 billion. 106

339. Money is allocated to regions based on local needs and the size of population.
Underdeveloped regions in Southern Italy receive more funds that those in the North and
Center. Sicilia received the largest amount, i.e., EUR 16.5 billion between 2001 and 2008,
through 47 APQs. Wealthy Northern regions, like Trento and Veneto, receive less money.

EUR 2 billion went to Trento for APQs signed between 2000 and 2007, while Veneto was
allocated EUR 2.2 billion between 2001 and 2009. There are some regions in the North that
still receive significant funds. It is the case of Toscana, with an overall EUR 13 billion
awarded for projects signed between 1999 and 2008, and Lombardia, with EUR 10.4 billion.
At the same time, there were regions in the South that obtained less money compared to
peers from the same geographical area. For example, Basilicata received EUR 2.4 billion for
APQs signed between 2002 and 2010, while Puglia benefited of EUR 5.7 billion from 2002 to
2010. 107 In recent years, the total value of projects covered by APQs amounted to EUR 6.2
billion. 108 Between 2012 and 2015 the largest amount went again to Sicilia, i.e., EUR 1.6
billion. Over the same period of time, Campania received EUR 1.7 billion, while Molise
received EUR 952 million, and Basilicata EUR 650 million. Other regions have gotten much
less money – e.g., EUR 26 million for Lombardia and 16.6 million for Lazio.

340. One of the largest interventions covered by an APQ is the EUR 1.16 billion
wastewater treatment project in Sicilia. EUR 213 million were allocated from the 2007-
2013 EU funds, in addition to EUR 532 million rescheduled from the previous programming
period. Other interventions included in APQs covered a number of issues, such as the
development of the South road A1-A14 San Vittore-Campobasso of national and inter-
regional strategic importance (EUR 482 million); mitigation of landslide risk in Sicilia (EUR
122 million); increasing treatment capacity of municipal wastewater in Veneto (EUR 19.5
million); and water networks in Puglia (EUR 89 million). Some of the APQs targeted social
infrastructure projects – e.g., development of the Hospital of the Sea in East Napoli (EUR
299 million).

341. Intervention areas vary quite a bit . For example, Abruzzo is strengthening regional
mobility (EUR 25.5 million) and developing local road protection in Matera (EUR 20 million).
Other APQs targeted natural and cultural heritage-related interventions, such as monitoring
the natural heritage in Basilicata (EUR 40 million) or ensuring safety and improvement of
the regional educational heritage in Basilicata (EUR 40.5 million).

3. Regional Development Programs and Regional Growth Programs in Sweden
342. Since the 2000s, Sweden relies on different regional instruments aimed at
coordinating various local and national public administration stakeholders in order to
promote regional development. The country transitioned from the Regional Growth
Agreements to the Regional Growth Programs and the Regional Development Programs.
However, these are not agreements per se, as they act rather as umbrella-type frameworks
guiding regional development in Sweden.

343. Regional Growth Agreements (RGA) were introduced in Sweden at the beginning
of previous decade to help coordination and policy adjustment in various sectors . They
were regional partnerships coordinated by county and regional boards, acting more like

platforms allowing for a more structured form of engagement, negotiation, and
collaboration between the central government and counties. These agreements were also
used to explore new approaches to regional and industrial development. The RGAs were
officially launched on January 1, 2000, and covered all 21 counties in the country. The RGAs
would allow representatives from municipalities, local business associations, and
universities to take the lead in drafting and implementing different regional action
programs. This regional partnership encouraged a cross-sectoral approach and
collaboration across various sectors and different ministries. Each county would prepare
assessments on potential opportunities and threats to regional and industrial development
that would be used when drafting regional development programs.

344. In 2004, the RGAs were replaced by Regional Growth Programs (RTPs) and
Regional Development Programs (RUPs). Both are currently the main instruments guiding
integrated regional development in Sweden, fostering an integrated approach to regional
policy. However, they are not genuine contracts nor real programs with an operational
dimension since they are not attached to a single budget or source of funding, but to
multiple sources. Both RUPs and RTPs bring together various local stakeholders involved in
regional development, such as representatives from different sectors, municipalities, the
private sector, and nonprofit organizations to formulate and agree on a particular policy
agenda.

345. The Regional Development Program (RUP) is the main instrument for designing
long-term development strategies targeting sustainable growth in each region in Sweden.
It defines investment priorities and regional strategies. From 2008 onward, the RUP acts
like an umbrella program gathering interventions from different sectors into a single
coherent strategy. It is more like a foundation for a number of regional development
strategies and programs, RTPs, EU funds, County Plans for Infrastructure, transport plans,
Environmental Programs, etc. The RUP was a key tool for implementing the Swedish
National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRDF). The 2007-2013 NSRDF was implemented
by 21 RUPs, 8 ERDF Regional Operational Programmes, and one European Social Fund (ESF)
program. RUPs proved to be crucial in mobilizing actors and funds in the Swedish regions,
especially during the financial crisis.

346. The RUP received some guidelines from the central government in terms of
design and from the NSRF on the content . The final version of the RUP is designed by the
regional authority or regional coordination body ( kommunalt samverkansorgan), which is
the County Administrative Board or regional autonomous body. The RUP is implemented by
a host of local actors, such as municipalities, county councils, businesses, relevant state
authorities, and other entities.

347. Regional Growth Programs (RTPs) are subsidiary programs based on RUPs, also
financed by the public and private sectors. The RTPs were perceived as operational sub-
programs of the RUP as they outline the priorities of the specific region, in addition to
funding and implementation methods. The RTPs are enforced by counties on a voluntary
basis. They focus on a wide range of areas, including labor, entrepreneurship, self-
employment, entrepreneurship, innovation systems, and sustainable development.




                                                                                       174
348. The RTPs have multi-objective instruments and are not linked to only one funding
program. The RTPs are seen as regional coordination bodies (county administrative boards)
for their own instrument, as they can easily adjust themselves to the regional needs. RTPs
focus on central government priorities, and they must prove these policies by justifying the
results and outcomes to the national government. This explains why there are such small
regional differences between investment priorities among RTPs. RTPs have limited capacity
to address specific development opportunities in each region.

349. Ecological sustainability was incorporated into these growth agreements, with the
aim of bringing an ecological element to sustainable development . Three pilot counties
were initially included in the new form of RTPs, namely Dalarna, Skane, and Västerbotten. A
government bill emphasized later that growth programs should be closely coordinated with
EU funds and programs and relevant areas of intervention. For example, the 2007-2013 RTP
for Västerbotten has five strategy areas, as follows: promoting environment, culture,
health, an attractive urban environment, and good living conditions; development of trade
and industry; skills and labor supply; accessibility and infrastructure; and international
cooperation and networking. 109

4. Contrat de Plan d’Etat-Région in France (State-Region Planning Contract)
350. Formerly known as state-region project contract, Contrat de Plan d’Etat -Région –
CPERs (the state-region planning contracts) is the primary mechanism of regional
development policy in France . CPERs are tools aimed at generating a coherent regional
policy at the local level, implementing the strategic directions of the central government
and the region over the past three decades in the country. The CPER is an agreement
between the state and the region, under which both parties undertake responsibilities to
plan and finance multiannual large infrastructure projects and/or support development of
specific sectors.

351. First introduced on a limited scale in the wake of the decentralization process in
the mid-1980s, the CPER is now an essential instrument of regional policy promoting
alignment with regions for clusters supported by national policies.110 France has a long
tradition in contractual practices as it had used such type of agreements in the form
contrats de ville (city contracts) in urban policies since the 1970s. The CPER is a detailed
contract that sets out specific policies and programs to be implemented by the central
government and regional/local authorities over a certain period of time. CPERs are co-
funding contracts (not delegation contracts) under which parties agree to carry out a
number of tasks and on the ways these activities should be funded. Central and regional
authorities jointly finance the interventions mentioned in the contract. Most of the money
is allocated for specific projects through the ministries. Some financial contribution comes
from the regional governments. An annex to the contract refers to the financial

tools intended to harmonize regional objectives with the targets promoted by the
government, the CPERs ensure that regional targets are not too diverse or too costly.

352. The first round of CPERs was enforced in 1984 and covered the period through
1988. There have been six rounds of contracts so far. The scope of contracts and money
allocated to regional projects expanded over the course of time. This top-down approach
to planning evolved into a more bottom-up view of agreements based on projects designed
by regions, which eventually strengthened the role of regional governments. If at the
beginning the CPER was designed as merely a tool to ensure consistency between the
national and regional plans, it gained some autonomy after the national plan was replaced
with the regional plans in the 1990s. Today, the CPER is a platform through which the
government ensures consistency among regional strategies. The CPER is planned
simultaneously for all regions and has the same duration. Starting with the 2000-2006
generation of planning contracts, the length of the agreement was expanded to six/seven
years in order to fall in line with the EU programming period and allow for some financial
contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European
Social Fund (ESF).

353. The CPERs put in practice the regional strategies that should be consistent with
national targets. However, there are some constraints on choosing regional objectives.
Most of the time, the government imposes certain objectives on regions, in line with the
national strategies. For example, funding of one high-speed train line is included in
different CPERs, although the purpose of this intervention was to build a national line and
no specifically local infrastructure was mentioned. 111 To this end, the projects included in
the CPER are within the limits set by the inter-ministerial committee for regional planning
and competitiveness placed under the French prime minister (i.e., Délégation
interministérielle à l’aménagement et la compétitivité des territoires - DIACT).

354. Both the region and the state are responsible for preparing the regional strategic
plan. Other regional actors, such as private companies, can contribute to this document.
The region and the government (the latter represented by the prefect) engage actively
during negotiations. Various analyses are conducted at this stage. The region hires experts
to conduct a SWOT analysis, while the prefect prepares the government’s strategy for the
regions, making sure that the document explains how the state would adjust its national
plan for that particular geographical area. The CEPR has a revision clause that would allow
the parties to modify the terms of the agreement, objectives, and the tools used in the
contract ’s implementation. Sometimes, the new data resulting from the analyses call for a
revision of the contract.

355.      As for the main legal provisions governing its application, the CPER was
established under the main framework for planning in France, approved on July 29, 1982,

subsequently modified by Law 2010-704 of June 28, 2010. 112 The law reviewed the central
planning system by creating a system of regional planning. The legislation set the strategic
medium-term objectives for the country’s economic, social, and cultural development, as
well as the elements to bring together the regions and different economic, social, and
environmental partners. The plan is developed in two steps. The first planning law defines a
six/seven year plan (it used to be five years) with key targets and relevant actions, setting
the ground for negotiations for the plan’s objectives. It also refers to areas where the state
should have leverage in negotiations considering the EU’s objectives. The second planning
legislation defines the legal, financial and administrative measures in connection to the
objectives identified in the first planning law.

356.       Each CPER has a regional council, responsible for conducting consultations
among stakeholders for drafting the plan. The council is also responsible for monitoring
the implementation of the contract. Members of the council include representatives from
the region, the central government, and different sectors (e.g., agriculture, banking, etc.).
The plan is developed through a complex and lengthy process. 18 months before the plan
enters into force a policy paper with priorities is prepared in consultations with all regions.
The document is submitted to the government at least one year before the plan is
enforced. The Government must draft the first planning law and send it to the Parliament
at the beginning of the year before the planning period would start. The government must
elaborate the second planning law four months before the plan becomes active. Once the
legislative body approves the second planning law, the government has the green light to
conclude the agreements with local authorities, regions, public and private companies. The
plan covers mutual obligations regarding contract implementation, and sets the duration of
the agreement. Initially, all activities outlined in CPERs had to be consistent with the
objectives included in the national plan; now the objectives should be in line with the
regional master plans. 113

357.       The prefect prepares the specific contracts between the region and the state
regarding the implementation of CPER activities. Within the limits of the annual budget,
the state shall provide investments in the form of capital grants, subsidies, loans, tax
regulations, and financial aid. The state should withdraw from projects that have not
started within 18 months following payment of the first financial assistance. EU assistance
can also be withdrawn for same reasons. During the first year of the CPER cycle and before
the end of the first quarter, the Government must prepare a report summarizing the
activities undertaken in the previous year, and then submit it to the Parliament for
approval. The achievements of the CPER must be presented in detail starting the second
year of the planning cycle. The termination clause allows both the central government and
the region to end the contract.

358. The planning contract is signed by the prefect of the region on behalf of the
central government and by the elected president of the region. Other stakeholders, such
as general councils of urban communities can join the CPER and should bring in their
financial contribution to the given interventions. The contracts are coordinated by steering
committees that include the regional prefect, the chair of the departmental authority, and
the head of the regional social and economic council.

359.       The scope of the CPER has expanded from one round of contract to another,
and so did the funds. For example, nearly EUR 41 billion was awarded for CPERs for the
period 2000-2006, by 56% more than the 1994-1999 planning cycle. Of this, the state
contributed 17.5 billion, the regions EUR 17.7 billion, and the local communities EUR 5.7
billion. The EU’s financia l input to the 2000-2006 CPER amounted to EUR 10.2 billion.

360. For many years, the CPER covered predominantly large infrastructure projects,
especially in public transportation; nevertheless, priorities have changed more recently
from so-called hard and tangible to soft and less tangible issues. Nowadays there is an
increase in the number of interventions dealing with general and qualitative goals, such as
increasing welfare of citizens, strengthening the connection among people in the region,
and sustainable development. In the 2000s, CPERs covered both hard and soft issues. For
example, the 2000-2006 planning contract for Midi-Pyrénées sought to develop the region
based on open, strong solidarity as to serve its inhabitants. 114 The CPER reform of the 2000s
readjusted broad objectives to regional contexts. Inspired by the Lisbon and Goteborg
European Councils promoting innovation, competitiveness, and sustainable development,
the new generation of CEPR narrows down the core areas to three key issues, namely
competitiveness and attractiveness of territories, sustainable development, and social and
economic territorial cohesion.

361. The 2015-2020 CPER is a new type of planning contract concentrating on six
priorities aimed at supporting the territorial reforms promoted by the French
Government. The new priorities are the following: multimodal mobility; higher education,
research, innovation; ecological and energy transition; digital technology; innovation for
the future; and territorial policies. In addition, there is cross-support targeting
employment. The newly introduced territorial component opens the paths toward
developing small projects under sub-contracts, such as contrats de pays (country contract),
contrats d’agglomération (agglomeration contracts), and contrats de parcs naturels
régionaux (regional natural parks contracts). These sub-contracts leave more room for
maneuver for local authorities since they can define projects identified by local and
regional actors. However, the projects must still be approved by the central government,
and should be consistent with the national strategy.

362. The French government will provide EUR 12.5 billion for the 2015-2020 planning
period.115 The largest funds will go to multimodal mobility (EUR 6.7 billion) and ecological
and energy transition (EUR 2.9 million). Education will receive EUR 1.2 billion, while
territorial policies will get nearly EUR 1 billion. The smallest share will fund innovation for
the future (EUR 50 million) and digital technology projects (EUR 32 million). Several public
utility services operators, such as the Environmental and Energy Agency and the Water
Agency, are among the stakeholders actively involved in the CPER. The CPER will also use
new funding sources. For example, between 2015 and 2017, EUR 900 million will come
from the Investment for Future Program, while the National Agency for Urban Renovation
will offer EUR 850 million for projects of regional interest under the new urban renewal
national program.

363. Although CPERs proved to be very useful, there are some shortcomings and
challenges to such type of contracts. One of issues is the lack of standardized or
centralized monitoring and evaluation procedures. The prefect conducted evaluations for
contract implementation in 1993, 1998, and 2000. Today, the contract performance is
assessed both at the national and regional level. Since 2005, DIACT performs the evaluation
at the national level, while an ad-hoc committee comprising representatives from central
government and regions is responsible at the local level. There have been 150 evaluations
of 1989-1993 CEPR and 160 assessments for the 2000-2006 CPER covering 16 areas of
interventions. Only the territorial component was evaluated 21 times in 13 regions during
2000 and 2006. Ninety of the 160 reports focused on seven areas, namely tourism,
methodology, employment, environment and sustainable development, cities, economic
development, and territorial policies.

364. Despite being an efficient regional policy instrument, the CPER is perceived
sometimes as a tool of state decentralization, rather than promoting a true partnership
between the state and the region . 116 Others complain that a big problem is the delay in
project implementation due to shortcomings related to availability of funds, reallocation of
money, and underestimated costs of poor or unfinished preliminary studies. At the same
time, the government’s financial contribution has not always been acceptable, and t here
have been differences in the financial support provided by the ministries to regions. For
example, in some areas the government’s financial support is quite high (e.g., education -
63%, cities - 68%, agriculture - 59%, foreign trade - nearly 70%), while in others, like health
and roads it was much lower, i.e., between 33% and 50%.
365. Some believe that the CPER would be more efficient if built on limited policies,
although some trust that such approach would actually hinder local initiative . Monitoring
and evaluation of the CPER performed by an independent council could increase the
transparency of the process. Previous CPERs pointed to the need of greater budget stability

long-term perspective. Last but not least, the region should produce a strategic document
orientation to strengthen its role as the leading intermediary structure between national
and subnational forms of government.

Case Study: CPER for Ile-de-France Region
366. In February 2015, the French government and Ile-de-France region (one of the 27
regions in the country) signed the 6th generation of planning contracts covering the 2015-
2020 period . 117 This CPER focuses on transport infrastructure, in line with priorities of the
region’s Master Plan aimed at advancing a new model of territorial planning an d
development and rebalancing the western and eastern parts of the region. This agreement
covers over 12,000 square kilometers, including Paris, with more than 12 million people
(approximately 18% of the total population of the country).

367.       The total value of the CPER is EUR 7.3 billion, by a third more than the previous
CPER. EUR 4.4 billion comes in financial support from the region and EUR 2.89 billion from
the government. Overall, transport projects account for 73% of the total value of the CPER.
The state and region shares differ from one component to another. For example, the
government will contribute by 51% to the energy component, while both state and region
shall have equal shares for education, innovation, and employment projects. The region
will cover 65% of investments in transport sector, while the state will contribute 35%.

368.       The focal point of the Ile-de-France contract planning is Nouveau Grand Paris
(New Grand Paris - NGP), an ambitious infrastructure project concentrating on the
development and modernization of public transport in the Paris area. Considered de facto
the Transportation Master Plan for the region, the project targets urban, social, and
economic sustainable development and employment as to strengthen Paris’ position
among the most attractive cities in the world. Other investments will tackle development
of river and harbor infrastructure, improving living conditions for students, development of
digital technology and renewable energy, thermal rehabilitation, and urban development.
The CPER sets a first by assigning funds for the development of cycling infrastructure.

369. The proposed public transport network should link the region’s main economic
centers and provide support to local development. NGP covers seven local territories
targeting seven areas of development, including innovation and research, health, finance,
and aeronautics. Interventions include an automated metro line encircling Paris (Grand
Paris Express), seven strategic centers, more than 200 kilometers of public transport
network, and 72 stops (of which 57 new stations) serving over 2 million passengers daily.
French authorities also plan to develop 70,000 new homes per year. The main beneficiary
of the project is Société du Grand Paris, a public entity responsible for the development of
the future metro, under the supervision of the Ministry of Territorial Equality and Housing,
the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, and the Ministry of Finance.

370. Interventions under NGP will bring together several stakeholders, such as the
government, region, local authorities, Metropole du Grand Paris (to be established in
2016), Chambers of Commerce, and a number of public transport companies . Overall,
French authorities will spend EUR 26 billion over the next 15 years, of which EUR 22.5
billion only will cover the metro network. Most funds will derive from tax revenues, state
subsidies (optional), local authority subsidies, loans, and local taxes (such as office tax,
special infrastructure tax, or flat-rate tax on network business). If needed, the state will
provide EUR 1 billion. Local authorities must contribute with up to EUR 225 million.

371. Some components of the NGP will be implemented through Contrats de
Développement Territorial – (Territorial Development Contracts – CDT). The 15-year
contracts between the state and local communities are planning and scheduling tools
designed by the state and local authorities in connection to this transportation project. 118
Established in 2010, the CDTs will translate NGP to the local level. There are 22 CDTs
dealing with 10% of the territory and 38% of the population of the Greater Paris Region,
spread across 157 local communities. As of June 2014, 21 CDTs were active. Fifteen local
territories have signed the framework agreement prompting the area of interest for future
contracts. The agreements are submitted to public consultation so citizens and interested
stakeholders learn about future interventions and provide feedback. 119

5. National Regional Policy in Switzerland
372. Since 2008, Switzerland employs a New Regional Policy (NRP) as an innovative
approach to regional development. It marks a substantial shift from redistribution of
resources from stronger to weaker areas to the promotion of endogenous growth
opportunities in less developed areas. To this end, the main objective of the NRP is to
provide assistance to rural, mountainous, and border areas as to increase their
competitiveness and help them bring some benefit to business development. Through this
new approach, the Swiss federal government aims to make these regions more attractive
for business and development opportunities and build a strong rural economy that should
eventually lead to reducing disparities among regions. The NRP aims to explore the
potential of regions and cantons and encourage cooperation among different stakeholders
– such as between regions and cantons, public and private institutions, and among
different economic sectors. 120

373. The Swiss regional policy is based on the principle of cooperation between
federal authorities and cantons. From this perspective, the NRP is established on three
pillars, namely: (i) increasing the economic strength of regions; (ii) ensuring coordination of
regional policy with relevant federal agencies; and (iii) providing expertise for regional
policy and people involved in the process. The NRP is executed through the federal
government’s eight -year program overseen by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs

(SECO). 121 The first multi-year program runs from 2008 through 2015 and focuses on areas
that have the highest development potential for rural and mountainous areas in the
country, including environmentally friendly tourism, energy industry, forestry and
agriculture, and education and health.

374. In consultation with the SECO, regions and cantons define the programs and
projects included in the long-term framework. The strategic orientation of the programs is
set by cantons, and is then reviewed by the federal government. Cantons are responsible
for implementing the activities under Pillar 1 of the NRP (i.e., increasing the economic
strength of the region), while the federal government plays a key role with regard to the
other two pillars. Pillar 1 is perhaps the main important component of regional
development policy in Switzerland, advancing development of innovation and a market-
oriented economy in order to increase competitiveness of regions and help them become
successful in a globalized economy. This pillar is the mechanism through which the
government offers support to local strategies and projects to enable cantons to boost their
economies by bringing together regional companies and institutions.

375. Pillar 1 is of the NRP is based on contractual arrangements between the Swiss
Confederation and the cantons. The cantons embark on four-year joint program
agreements in which local authorities define specific objectives for their regions. In fact,
these programs are the arena where cantons select, structure, and execute the projects
that have been agreed upon with the federal government. These agreements also point to
government’s financial contribution to specific regional policies. 122 The Swiss government
provides CHF 40 million (approximately EUR 37.5 million) per year in federal grants, in
addition to EUR 50 million annually in loans to implement the agreements. 123 The cantons’
contribution of should match the support from federal government.

376. The cantons are key players in developing, funding, and implementing the four-
year joint program agreements. First, they must propose the local strategy and identify the
necessary steps for program implementation. Only when the canton is very clear about the
development goals and the way they should be put in practice, the federal government will
start providing the money. A canton designs together with the region the program
implementation. The canton may also decide whether it would engage in cross-border
cooperation with neighboring cantons or other European countries, and incorporate the
respective strategies into the program. The second step is signing the agreement. After the
government reviews the strategy, both parties sign a joint program contract that defines
the objectives, activities, and financial contribution of each party. The final step is the
implementation of the program. The canton will ensure that it will use the funds made
available by the federal government to implement the activities included in the strategy. It
will also ensure to carry out the objectives and activities on which both parties have
agreed. The canton must also monitor the program achievements and prepare the annual
reporting. The contract can be adjusted if important changes occurred. The joint program

The Polish Model for Deploying Territorial Contracts
377. Soon after the 1999 decentralization process that awarded more powers to
regions and a few years before its 2004 EU accession, Poland embarked on innovative
institutional reforms aimed to improve coordination among different levels of
government. Regional Contracts and, later on, Territorial Contracts are the main
instruments to establish cooperation between central and regional authorities and help
better coordinate public investments in Poland.

378. Given Romanian authorities’ interest in the Polish mode l for absorbing EU funds
and managing public investments, this section focuses exclusively on Poland. Some of the
elements featured by the instruments described below are similar to those encountered in
Spain, Italy, and Sweden; others are quite unique to the Polish context. The next section
explores the potential applicability of such tools to Romania.

Regional Contracts
379. The 1999 decentralization established elected several types of administrative units
at the subnational level – 16 regions (voivodships), 308 counties (powiats), and 2,489
municipalities (gminas), totaling 2,809 “self-government” units in the country. These
administrative entities have different responsibilities with regard to transport, water, and
social infrastructure, including planning, development, maintenance, monitoring and
evaluation. Each voivodship has its own Regional Operational Program.

380. The pioneers of regional development tools in Poland, Regional Contracts (RCs),
were introduced in Poland in 2000. It was the first civil legal agreement concluded between
the government and the voivodships, with a clearly defined objective to promote and
advance regional development. The contract was signed by the minister responsible for
regional development at that time and the Marshall of the voivodship (the head of the
region). The contract was designed as a main tool for executing regional strategies and
preparing regions for managing future EU funds at the regional level. These documents
acted as the development program at the regional level, funded through sector investment
plans sponsored by the central government. Initially, RCs covered activities under regional
programs funded by the government, on one hand, and interventions supervised by
relevant ministers and additionally supported by local governments, on the other hand. RCs
were connected to the regional programs established by voivodships.

381. RCs introduced a new philosophy in that regional development can be achieved
through cooperation among different social and economic partners for a viable program.
The RC was the first instrument of regional policy to allow transferring additional funds
from the state budget to regions in order to finance development-related tasks at the local
level. Provisions stipulated in the contract endowed local authorities with responsibilities to
manage public funds at regional and local level. The main beneficiaries of the RCs were
municipalities, counties, economic and professional entities, NGOs, scientific and research
institutions, (private) entrepreneurs, and other entities involved in regional development.



                                                                                          183
382. For all their innovative character, RCs also faced a number of challenges . The main
problem was that the contracts would cover rather small projects since there was only little
money dedicated to regional development programs at that time. Also, since they were
managed at the regional level, not all parties (i.e., government authorities) appreciated
these agreements. At the same time, as most of the regional development programs were
designed at the national level, they did not give much leverage to regional administrations
to pursue their own views about regional development.

383. It is important to mention that before drafting the first version of RCs, Polish
authorities approved significant programming documents laying out the foundation for a
better preparation and implementation of regional development programs. Two key
documents in this respect were the National Regional Development Strategy defining the
main principles and implementation instruments of regional development for the period
2000-2006, and the Support Program (PW), a three-year document outlining objectives,
procedures, and conditions for state support granted for regional programs.

384. The first version of RCs was inspired from best practices applied in other EU
countries (especially France). The first batch of regional contracts was signed in 2001 for a
two-year period. These were large documents of about 300 pages (including annexes), with
a comprehensive structure. Provisions of the agreement mentioned objectives of the
contract, a detailed project description, financial obligations to be undertaken by parties,
diagnosis of the region, monitoring indicators, and some financial procedures. The contract
also outlined the rules that the beneficiaries should fulfill to get the money and financial
liabilities of the government and local administration. The Minister of Regional
Development (MRD) was in charge with assessing the implementation of RCs.

385. The second batch of RCs was renegotiated at the beginning of 2002 and the first
new contracts were signed in 2004, with a duration of a maximum of three years.
Interestingly, the country’s accession to the EU in 2004 and the implementation of the first
EU-funded program diminished significantly the role of RCs. The EU-funded Integrated
Regional Operational Programme (IROP) for the period 2004-2006 had become the basic
regional program for the RCs. The contracts still continued to maintain the role of
instruments for state-budget funds supporting areas not covered by IROP, although their
financial magnitude fell sharply and continued to decrease in the following years. The third
batch of RCs was signed in 2004 and 2005, and covered the period from 2004 through 2006,
based on an annual agreement. This version of RC took into account the annual Support
Program (PW).

386. The last version of RCs was implemented in 2007-2009. It was governed by the
2006 Act on the principles of development policy, which replaced the 2000 Act on the
principles of supporting regional development. Perhaps the most important legislation in
the field of regional development in Poland, the 2006 Act was the key document to
leverage the role of RCs by making them the basic tool for implementing national and
regional development strategies. Among other things, the Act outlined government
procedures on regional development and the rules for getting funds for regional
development projects. The law also defined the programs for disasters, emergency
situations, and economic crisis response, and other pilot programs testing the newly


                                                                                        184
approved financial instruments on regional development aimed at increasing the
administrative capacity to implement such programs. Most of the interventions included in
the RCs were drawn from the EU-funded ROPs.

387. This new version of RCs comprising a maximum of 30 pages was more effective
than the previous ones, as it put more emphasis on objectives, priority projects, funding
sources, and responsibilities of parties. It would increase transparency of the use of state
budget funds and the 16 ROPs by regulating the financial obligations for both parties and
setting some basic principles for project implementation. Also, it would be based on
diagnostics and include indicators and appropriate measures (such as reporting and
control).

388. Most of the interventions covered by RCs were related to infrastructure
development in transport, communication, environmental protection, and social services .
For example, considering the Lubelskie region, the largest number of projects funded under
RCs was in education, i.e., 403 interventions for 235 beneficiaries, with a total value of EUR
50 million. A third of the money was the contribution from the region and local
governments. Interventions targeted the construction and modernization of 69 schools and
the development of 98 sports facilities. Interventions in the transport, of which 40% was
provided through local budgets, covered, primarily, the renovation and modernization of
municipal and local roads – around 154 km of roads and restoration of 2 bridges. The RCs
for the period from 2004 to 2006 included over 100 social assistance projects totaling EUR
5.7 million, of which 70% came from the state budget. The money went to repairing and
modernization of social homes, development of new facilities, and new equipment. Around
EUR 8.8 million was spent on 48 healthcare projects. Interventions in healthcare sector
benefited of the highest co-financing from the state budget, i.e., 83%. Projects targeted
construction and renovation of healthcare facilities in order to improve medical services in
the region. In addition, EUR 48 million was assigned for development of three regional
hospitals. Environmental projects amounted to nearly EUR 8 million, of which 58% was the
contribution from local budgets. The money was used to develop, among other things, six
waste storage facilities and wastewater plants, and 40 water treatment facilities.
Approximately EUR 3.7 million were used to develop 170 km of water and 23 km of sewage
network; half of the money came from the local budgets. With support from state and local
budgets, Lubelskie also developed a few energy projects, such as the construction of 30 km
of gas network and 1 km of energy grid. A little over EUR 5 million was spent on social
initiatives activities aimed at promoting the local heritage.

Territorial Contracts
389. The Territorial Contracts (TCs) recently replaced the RCs and will be used for the
2014-2020 programming period. The TCs have become the new instruments for
coordination among central and regional governments, opening the way for investments
targeting specific needs and strengths of each region. The TCs are legal agreements signed
between the voivodships and the central government to implement regional development
policies and projects within the Polish National Strategy for Regional Development (NSRD)
2010-2020. The contracts cover priorities covering certain areas of interventions, consistent
to the NSRD and the Regional Development Strategy for each region.



                                                                                         185
390. TCs should improve coordination of development activities undertaken by central
and regional authorities and increase cohesion, complementarities, and synergies with
regard to regional development. These contracts are signed after each region and the
government have agreed on projects and funding sources. The TC’s main priorities are set
by the 16 ROPs (one per region).

391. The TCs are designed to coordinate activities undertaken by national and regional
public administration with regard to regional development. Interventions should focus on
areas of strategic importance for the country and with significant regional impact. The TCs
are meant to bring about some sort of order into the strategic thinking and management.
The new form of regional agreements are expected to strengthen cooperation and
partnership between the voivodships and the government, and trigger a higher degree of
consistency between goals and objectives set by government authorities and those outlined
by regions. It is expected that these agreements will lay out the stage for a more rational
allocation of public funds and spending, and avoid implementation of overlapping projects
or low priority interventions – Romania faces today much of the same issues.

392. Under the TCs, the government undertakes the commitment to suppo rt the
priority projects in the region . The contract defines clearly what priority projects the
voivodship should embark on in order to advance regional development. The contract is
signed by the Minister for Infrastructure and Development (MID) on behalf of the
government and the Marshal of the Voivodship (the head of the region and head of the
Marshall’s Office) on behalf of the region. The TCs set specific objectives and tasks for the
parties, and mention the source of funding to achieve these targets. Interventions included
in the TC must be consistent with regional policies and the regional development strategy.
Projects should be in line with relevant actions included in the regional strategies, the
national cohesion policy, and the EU 2020 Strategy.

393. The projects covered by a TC can be financed by different funding sources, be it
national, EU, or private. To this end, the money could come from: a) national public funds –
especially those released by the MID, including EU funds and from other donors; b) funds
managed by other ministries (including EU funds) and money from regional and local
budgets; c) International Financial Institutions (such as the World Bank); and d) other
public, semi-public, and private funds. The financial contribution from the central
government for each contract should not exceed 60%, while the regions should cover 40%
of projects’ costs.

394. The region and the MID must agree on areas of interventions, strategic
investments, specific projects, and funding sources . After the Regional Marshall Office
decides on areas of interventions, a list of projects is prepared based on proposals
promoted by relevant regional institutions, organizations, and companies. These proposals
are analyzed by a committee chaired by the Marshall. The proposed interventions are
complemented by projects promoted by the central government. A detailed table
comprising the type project, responsible entity, foreseen source of funding, and
implementation conditions is produced and included in the contract, as in the example
reproduced below. The catch is that all projects included in the TC (even those with state-
budget financing) are linked to the EU Operational Programmes, which would make quite


                                                                                        186
difficult for the parties to change the contract provisions or the list of projects. Once the
contract is signed, it is highly unlikely that the list of projects would undergo major changes,
regardless of political changes or other evolutions in the country.

Case in Point: The Podlaskie Voivodship124
395. The Territorial Contract for Podlaskie was signed between the Marshall’s Office
(through the Marshall and a Member of the Voivodship Board) and the Ministry of
Infrastructure and Development (through the Minister). The contract has three chapters.
The first section tackles general provisions (subject and duration of the contract) and
funding sources; the second one covers objectives and priority activities related to each
area of intervention and the list of projects; and the last part deals with amendments and
litigations.

396. The Act of 2006 on the principles of regional development is mentioned right at
the beginning of the text, as the governing legislation for the contract. Further, the TC
refers to 19 national, regional, and EU strategies and regulations, in addition to EU
operational programs. These include: the Resolution of the Council of Ministers approving
the TC for Podlaskie; the EU Partnership Agreement for Poland (PA); the Regional
Operational Program for 2014-2020; the National Operational Programs; the National
Strategy of Regional Development 2014-2020; the National Regional Strategy for 2010-2014
– regions, towns, rural areas; the Country Development Strategy 2030; the Strategy for
Socio-Economic Development of Eastern Poland; the Podlaskie Voivodship Development
Strategy by 2020; the EU 2020 Strategy; the European Parliament and European Counc il’s
regulations on ERDF; the European Social Funds; the Maritime and Fishery Fund; the 2014
Act on principles of implementation of the programs in the area of cohesion policy financed
in the period 2014 – 2020; and the Voievodship’s regulations on territorial government and
on public finances. The TC stipulates that Podlaskie will receive Zlot 18.5 billion
(approximately EUR 4.4 billion) of Zlot 400 billion (EUR 95.8 billion) to cover regional
development policies in Poland between 2014 and 2023.

   See Annex 4 for the full text of the Podlaskie Voivodship Territorial Contract (translated into
English). See Annex 5 for the full text of the Wielkopolskie Voivodship Territorial Contract (translated
into English), as a point of comparison.




                                                                                                   187
397.     The first section of the agreement stresses that both parties agree to collaborate
for the 2014-2020 programming period and employ objectives with regard to cohesion
policy. The Territorial Government (the Voivodship) shall ensure that the ROP will be
implemented according to the PA. Regional authorities also agree to contribute to the
implementation of the projects by getting funds from the ROP’s managing authorities and
intermediate bodies. The MID undertakes responsibility to secure state budget funds to
partially cover the domestic contribution of projects. The figures should be defined by the
Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance, after approval of the ROP by the
European Commission. The duration of the contract is from 2014 through 2023, but it can
be shortened upon consent by parties. The TC could be terminated by any party, with a
prior 6-month written note. Perhaps the most important article of this section is the one
referring to the funding sources. These can be under operational programs, the state
budget, the Voivodship budget, local budgets, funds released by other public finance sector
units, special governmental funds, other public funds, and private funds.

398. The second chapter of the contract outlines the main objectives and areas of
intervention. Podlaskie has identified 11 main areas of intervention, as follows:
improvement of research quality and strengthening collaboration between the science
sector and the rest of the economy; development of international and domestic road and
railway and transport connections; modernization of power distribution and transmission
systems; reduction of social exclusion; modernization of crossing borders in the Voivodship;
better use of the natural and cultural potential of the Voivodship; increasing employment in
the region; enhancing the level of education and competences; upgrading quality and
availability of healthcare services; development of the Voivodship city and its functional
areas; and revival of areas with high concentration of social and economic issues.

399. Each project is linked to a strategy or document covering the respective area of
intervention . For example, the relevant documents for transport infrastructure projects are
the National Roads Construction Program and the Multiyear Programme of Railway
Investments. Both the MID and the region should bring in additional funding sources,
others than those covered by the OPs; in addition, the Voivodship should also carve out
some financial contribution from local budgets. The transport projects cover a wide range
of activities, such as: construction of international corridors servicing express roads with
heavy traffic transit; improvement of national and regional roads to ensure external
connections; development of express roads connecting regional centers; development and
modernization of railways connecting to neighboring voivodships; and upgrading of railway
network providing access to local labor markets. For their part, the projects in the
healthcare sector are in line with the regional needs, and also consistent with priorities set
in the Policy Paper on health protection for the period 2014-2020 and the National
Healthcare Strategy. The TC does not tackle water infrastructure under a specific area of
intervention. The only reference to the water sector is made in the context of flood
prevention. Investments aimed at protecting against floods should be done according to the
updated water master plans.

400. The priority projects are divided into core (basic) projects and projects to be
pursued upon fund availability. The document mentions 25 core projects, in addition to 14
possible (back-up) interventions. Although most of the investments are related to transport


                                                                                         188
infrastructure, there are a number of social infrastructure, R&D, and energy projects too.
The table contains the name of the project, responsible entity for project implementation
(the Government or the Voivodship), source of funding, and conditions for project
execution. For example, the development of a few sections of S-8 Radziejowice – Białystok
road in the area of Podlaskie Voivodship will be executed by the Government with money
from appropriate the OPs for the period 2014-2020. This project is included in the
Implementation Document to the Transport Development Strategy and in the National
Roads Construction Program for 2011-2015.

401. Nevertheless, even some of the projects included in the core section might
depend on funds available for certain programs. It is the case of the S-61 Ostrów
Mazowiecka-Augustów bypass (the sections covering Podlaskie) funded through the
Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and EU-funded OPs. A note reads that if the project is not
approved by the CEF, then it should be entirely implemented through OPs. Other projects
are financed entirely from state budget funds. An example in this respect is the extension of
the Fryderyk Chopin Music University - Instrumental-Pedagogical Faculty in Białystok – a
multiyear project implemented by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. The
same goes for the reconstruction and extension of the University Clinical Hospital of the
Medical University of Białystok, a multiyear project implemented from state funds by the
Ministry of Health. The TC underlines clearly that implementation of projects from the
pipeline list depends upon fund availability. For example, the construction of the voivodship
road Białystok – Supraśl is subject to negotiations between Poland and the European
Commission.

402. Within five month upon drafting the TC, the parties must prepare and exchange
information about projects that made it to the priority list . Any other changes to the list of
interventions should be approved by both parties. If information about a particular project
is not complete, then the respective intervention could be removed from the list. By mid-
February of each year, the MID should send information about projects to the managing
authorities for the OPs. At the same time, it should request information from appropriate
managing authorities of the OPs about contract/project implementation in the previous
year. They should also ask for data from relevant authorities sponsoring projects that are
not covered by the EU programs. By the end of April, the voivodship should provide the
MID with information on contract performance for the previous year and how the
objectives and projects under the ROP were fulfilled. By the end of May, the MID should
pass on to the voivodship an assessment on the TC’s performance during the previous year.
The voivodship should provide comments on the draft within a week; the draft is approved
if there are no comments. Comments from the region should be reviewed by the MID and,
ultimately, they should be included in the document.

403. Litigations occurring during the implementation of the contract should be sorted
out amicably, as stipulated by the TC. If one party is in breach of the agreement and
infringes contract provisions, it must remedy the issues promptly. In this context, an
infringement is considered any action or negligence of not taking certain actions. The guilty
party should be asked in writing to remedy the problem. If litigations cannot be solved
amicably, they can be settled in the general county court in the jurisdiction to which the
registered office of the MID belongs. However, since it is not clearly specified what an


                                                                                          189
action or a missed action exactly means, infringement and breach of contract could be
played down easily by the parties.


Adapting and Adopting Territorial Contracts in Romania
404. Applying the Polish model of Territorial Contracts in Ro mania may require some
significant changes from legal, institutional, and administrative perspectives. In many
ways, this instrument is much harder to implement than multiyear budgeting, for which
Romania already has a legal and policy foundation in place (albeit insufficient, it provides a
good starting point). A main reason for why this model of contractual agreement between
central and regional administrations proved to be successful in Poland and helped improve
public investments’ coordination across levels of government is related to the strong
degree of decentralization in the country. The voivodships, the largest territorial
administrative unit in Poland, play a crucial role at the regional level. Romania, by contrast,
lacks a formal regional administrative level, so until that happens – if the regionalization
agenda ever leads to adjusting the Constitution and carrying forth all the other needed legal
and regulatory changes – the contracts would have to fit the current administrative
structure. In practice, this would mean signing eight agreements between the MRDPA and
each administrative region, represented by the Regional Development Council (RDC).

405. RDCs function as a partnership between authorities at different levels within a
region (county, city, communes). The RDC’s mandate, as defined by law 315/2004, 125
covers precisely the coordination of regional development policies and programs, both
those funded from EU sources and those financed through the state budget. In relation to
the ROP, the RDC of ea ch region oversees the RDA’s activities, making sure that all counties
within a region receive a fair and equal treatment. The RDC funds parts of RDAs’ budgets
through the county budgets. Its membership includes the presidents of counties in each
region and three representatives of local administrations in the county (one for each level
of local councils – municipalities or major cities, towns, and communes). The RDC is led by a
president and vice-president, positions that rotate among counties in a particular region,
and its secretariat is provided by the RDA.

406. Introducing a meaningful territorial contract between the central government –
most likely, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) –
and RDCs across Romania – would require several elements . These include: (i) strategic
projects at the county level; (ii) clear regional/local priorities and targets; and (iii) strong
commitment from relevant stakeholders to carry out these interventions, regardless of
political changes. The first two are fulfilled, at a basic level, as even currently there are
County and Regional Development Strategies that define key projects and priorities. It is
also true that their quality is not always at the highest standard – for instance, a common
issue is precisely that funding sources are not always identified and the result is a long wish
list of projects without any reasonable anchoring in priorities and resource availability.
Moreover, it is crucial that the main actors of the agreement (i.e., counties) should stick to
the priorities outlined in the contract and try not to change the provisions or the list of

125
      See “Monitorul Oficial nr. 577 din 29.06.2004”




                                                                                           190
projects. Regardless of who is going to be the president of the County Council or what
political party might be brought to power by the next elections, all relevant parties should
stick to the responsibilities and commitments undertaken through a potential agreement.
This would be the main aim – and benefit – of county-level TCs in Romania.

407. In addition to political commitment, the following principles should be followed
for an effective deployment of this instrument in the current Romanian context:
       True integration of strategic priorities: The TCs between counties and the central
        level (the MRDPA) should not duplicate or contradict existing planning documents,
        but bring everything together (development strategies, spatial plans, programming
        documents for EU and state-budget funds, etc.). This would also require
        coordination with higher-level documents (e.g., regional development strategies,
        the General Transport Master Plan, etc.).
       An appropriate legal framework: Ideally, Romania should have a specific legislation
        regulating (regional) development, just like the Polish 2006 Act on the principles of
        development policy, which is the overarching legal framework governing the
        relation between voivodships and the central government under the TCs. Another
        possible solution would be amending the Law on Public Administration as to allow
        signing and enforcing agreements between RDCs and the central government.
        Currently, counties and governments can engage in contractual legal relationships
        for specific investment projects.
       Credible sanctions and/or rewards: If one party breaches the TCs, there need to be
        clear mechanisms to sanction such actions. At the same time, projects included in a
        TC could be rewarded with bonus points during evaluation processes (whether
        under EU or state-budget-funded programs) or, in the aggregate, regions that
        manage to maintain the same TC priorities for an entire programming period may
        receive additional transfers for projects from the national budget. All this would
        serve the purpose of ensuring more predictability and stability in designing and
        implementing a set of strategic investments.
       Proper consultations: Political commitment depends on wide ownership of the
        priorities set in a TC. Indeed, drafting such a document should come as the result of
        wide-ranging consultations with all political parties, with civil society activists,
        members of the academia, and representatives of the private sector.
       Multiyear budgeting: To the full extent possible, the TCs should have the same
        timeline as EU funds (i.e., seven plus three years) and state-budget funds should
        also be able to operate in a multiannual framework. The previous chapter focused
        on this specific issue.
       Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms: The MRDPA, as the leader of public
        administration reform in Romania, should take on the role of monitoring and
        evaluating the design and implementation of TCs. This would allow for continuous
        improvement of this tool, sharing of good practices, etc.




                                                                                         191
Piloting Territorial Contracts in Romania
408. Without any doubt, before pursuing a particular framework of territorial
contracts, extensive testing and piloting is needed. One alternative to the regional model
described above is to have TCs at the level of counties – all counties or just some, based on
an opt-in or opt-out system. The following paragraphs take on the illustrative example of a
contract signed between the MRDPA and the County of Bihor in Western Romania. The
contract could be signed between the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA - represented by the Minister) and the County Council (through the
President of the County Council).

409. Bihor County has a coherent and specific development strategy for 2014-2020,
which contains clear objectives, targets and projects on short- and medium-term. The
document includes projects, sectors, budget estimates, funding sources, and priority levels
of projects. Project implementation is also clearly defined. A brief project description refers
to some key elements, like relevance of the intervention for the envisioned development
and connection to the county’s strategic goals; integration with national/regional strategies;
territorial reach; main activities; applicant and potential partners; forecast funding sources;
implementation timeline, priority degree; and project status.

410. The Bihor TC should also refer to key relevant national, regional/county, and EU
strategies. For example, among the national strategies could be the National Sustainable
Development Strategy 2013-2020-2030, the Government Program 2013-2016, the General
Transport Master Plan, the National Territorial Development Strategy 2030, the National
Health Strategy for 2014-2020, the Sectoral Strategy on Culture and Cultural Heritage for
2014-2020, the Strategy on Education and Professional Training 2014-2020, and the Sports
Strategy 2030. The most important document at the regional level should be the
Development Plan for the North-West region (where Bihor County is geographically
located). The Regional/Bihor County Water Master Plan, the Bihor County Development
Strategy, and the County General Urban Plan are perhaps the key strategic documents at
the county level. As for EU strategies, the list should include the EU-Romania Partnership
Agreement 2014-2020, the Europe 2020 Strategy, the TEN-T Policy, and perhaps some of
the sectoral regulations, like the Drinking Water Directive, etc.

411. Following the Polish model, two lists of priority projects should be drafted in
consultation with relevant local and national stakeholders. One list should include the
core projects and the other should cover interventions subject to fund availability. The list
of projects should be drafted in consultation with relevant local stakeholders (counties,
cities, and communes). A good starting point in picking the priorities could be the current
development strategy, which applies a prioritization method based on correlation with
other investments at various stages in the county and in connection to other future
investments from the strategic and specific projects. Of course, some of the projects should
be implemented based on emerging opportunities and available funding. Each project that
should make it to the list should be correlated with at least one significant strategy. It is
important to mention the source of funding for each project, as well as what would be the
financial contribution of the county/city/commune, whenever applicable.




                                                                                          192
412. For example, a project that would likely have a good chance of making it to the
core priority would be the rehabilitation and modernization of 33 kilometers of the
county road 764, with an estimated value of approximately EUR 28 million. The potential
source of funding identified is the Regional Operational Programme. The project is in line
with the county’s strategic objective targeting development of public infrastructure in the
county, and also with the specific objective of modernization of transport in Bihor. The
proposal is also included in the Development Plan for North-West region. The project is of
national importance too, as it would connect to the TEN-T.

413. The contract should indicate the entities responsible for the implementation of
the projects, their duration, and timeline. The section on litigation and non-compliance
could be improved compared to the Polish version. The actions and situations that would
lead to the breach of the contract should be better defined. To this end, the contract could
make it more clear what are the actions of non-compliance and what negligence (or non-
action) could mean. Moreover, the signatory parties might consider providing a better
definition of actions that could jeopardize the implementation of the contract, and give
examples of actions that could put the parties in breach of the agreement. In addition to
the overall performance of the contract, an assessment of each project should be required.
If the implementation is delayed or does not correspond to the timeline both parties have
mutually agreed upon, then the responsible party should be held accountable and should
face (administrative) penalties. If a certain percentage of projects included in the list are
underperforming over a period of time, then the activities undertaken by the responsible
party should be reviewed and immediate actions to remedy the situation should be taken.


Recommended Action Steps for the MRDPA
414. To move forward the conversation on introducing territorial contracts in
Romania, the MRDPA should pursue the following steps:
       Create a technical task team responsible for evaluating in-depth the opportunity of
        adopting territorial contracts in Romania. This internal team could also collaborate
        with outside experts from other Member States and International Financial
        Institutions.

       Assemble a group of legal experts and explore requirements, needed changes, etc.
        This is important to determine what can be done under the current legal framework
        and what changes are needed, if any. It would be particularly critical to establish
        the type of sanctions and positive rewards that could be tied to the adoption of
        territorial contracts.

       Launch a consultation process with subnational governments to test the idea and
        decide on the optimal structure . This could be done through a series of events in
        each region, enlisting the help of Regional Development Agencies. Of particular
        important would be to decide who the parties to the agreement could be: for
        example, the MRDPA and county councils, or the MRDPA and RDCs, or both (in
        parallel).

       Prepare a full action plan and timeline for implementation . This will depend on
        generating sufficient momentum and buy-in from all stakeholders involved.


                                                                                        193
   Launch pilot territorial contracts in a number of jurisdictions.

   Monitor and evaluate pilot results and adapt, launch, and implement the model for
    the national scale. This is obviously contingent on how well the pilot TCs perform in
    practice. External experts should be involved to assess the results of TCs, covering a
    series of critical areas: legal; technical; policy design; and monitoring and evaluation
    (M&E).

Annex 1. Input-Output Analysis to Assess the Impact of the
PNDL 2014-2020

The impact assessment of the infrastructure investment program in Romania is based on
the Input-Output methodology, facilitating the identification of the direct and indirect
effects of the changes on the demand-side variables on the economy. The Input-Output
methodology is one of the main methodologies used in assessing the macroeconomic
impact of different types of investment on the economy126 . The methodology captures the
transmission mechanism of the investment on relevant variables through the interactions
between the branches of the economy.

The data required for the Input-Output analysis is available in the symmetric input-
output tables. The data is available from the ESA supply, use and input-output tables made
available by Eurostat 127 . From this, the symmetric input-output tables are used which are
compiled by converting the supply and use tables expressed in basic prices. The tables
encompass four quadrants which reflect: a) the requirements for intermediate inputs (first
quadrant); b) final use of goods and services (second quadrant); c) requirements for
primary inputs (third quadrant); d) market transactions (forth quadrant). The data is
disaggregated at the level of 65 sectors in accordance with NACE rev2 128 . Based on the
infrastructure investment priorities an aggregation of the 65 sectors to 4 sectors was done
(see Appendix 2). This aggregation reflects the relation between the type of investments
and the sectors where the investments are directed.

The input-output tables are used to calculate specific technical input coefficients, the
Leontief matrix and its’ inverse based on which the impact o f the exogenous changes in
the final demand components are calculated. The input-output tables are used to
calculated specific technical input coefficients for intermediates, final demand components
and primary inputs129 . The matrix of input coefficients for intermediates is used to calculate
the Leontief inverse. If we accept that sectorial output is produced with fixed technical
coefficients130 then the balance between total inputs and outputs can be described by the
relation between the vector of final demand, Leontief inverse and the vector of outputs.
This algebraic relation facilitates the identification of the impact of changes in the final
demand components on output. Changes in this algebraic relation (see Annex 1.1) allows to
identify the impact of the investment program on value added and compensation of
employees.

The impact of the infrastructure investment on output, value added and compensation of
employees is calculated reflecting a threefold effect: a) on the aggregated economy, b)
competitiveness and return of investment, and c) the social impact through the
employees’ compensation. The balance between total inputs and outputs is used to
calculate the impact of changes in the final demand vector (see Annex 1.1). The
infrastructure investments are captured by the gross fixed capital formation component of
the final demand. At this point two comments are in order.

First of all, the relation between vector of final demand, Leontief inverse and the vector of
outputs is represented in differences (see Annex 1.1). The justification behind this choice
resides in the fact that the results of the transformation doesn’t depend on the level of the
components from the input-output tables, but only on the structural relations between
them.

These structural relations are stable on the short and medium term 131 thus justifying the
use of the latest input-output data, for 2010, in the analysis for the 2014-2020 time frame.
Second of all, the impact of infrastructure investment is traced in respect to three strategic
dimensions: a) the impact on the aggregated economy; b) the impact on competitiveness
and return of investment and c) the social impact through the employees’ compensation.
This facilitates a more refined assessment of the investment effect.


Impact of the infrastructure investment program. Main results
There is strong positive impact of the infrastructure investment program on economic
output, value added and compensation of employees, the highest being on economic
output reflecting the strong driving effect of investment. The impact on output comprise
the direct and indirect effects from the Leontief inverse and incorporates not only the
value added from the industry but also intermediate consumption. In this respect, the
increase in output reflects the capacity of the investment to stimulate the economy.
Adding to these it should be taken into account that this investment comprises mainly of
fixed assets for which the amortization period is longer than the actual process of
implementing the investment. This indicates that the impact of the fixed assets is even
higher than indicated by the output multipliers.

Sectors with a higher value added generate a higher net yield, consequently investments
in these sectors, for example the ones included under Services, generate a higher return
of investment. The increase in value added is strongly correlated with the net yields of the
sectors. Consequently, a higher impact of investment on value added reflects higher yields.
Table 1 suggests that the highest impact is registered in the case of services. Sectors with a
high value added multiplier are for example Education and Activities auxiliary to financial
services and insurance activities, characterized by a low weight of intermediate
consumption and a high percent of high skilled workers. These are also the sectors which
tend to increase the overall competitiveness of an economy. The construction sector has a

          strong driving effect on economic activity, but a much lower value added than the above
          mentioned sectors. This indicates that the investment program should be targeted
          strategically to optimize the achievement of multiple targets like: a) a high driving effect on
          the economy; b) a high return of investment . In this context, it should be mentioned that the
          infrastructure investment program excels in regard to the first objective, but not in respect
          to the second.

          The infrastructure investment has an important social impact generating an increase of
          680.2 million euro for the period 2014-2020 in compensation of employees. There are
          some sectors which have a higher compensation of employees’ multiplier, especially the
          ones hiring skilled workers. Cases entering this category are: Scientific research and
          development, Education, Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and
          analysis. Investments in these sectors would lead to a high increase in income. This is not
          the case of the infrastructure investment which targets sectors with a lower than average
          compensation of employees multiplier. Nonetheless due to the high nominal value of the
          investments, the increase in income is significant.

          The infrastructure investment generates 2.04 euro of economic activity per 1 euro spent,
          indicating a higher than unity multiplicative effect and underling the usefulness of the
          investment. The result reflects the relation between the total value of investment and

    increase in output. The value is comparable with other cases132 reflecting the strong driving
    effect of investment.

    The highest indirect impact of the infrastructure investment in terms of value added and
    compensation of employees is registered in the case of Services generating an increase of
    586.2 million euro for the period 2014-2020 in value added and 267.8 million euro in
    compensation of employees. The results highlights the strategic importance of the sectors
    hiring high skilled workers and the capacity to generate value with a low weight of
    intermediate consumption. At the same time it reflects the high driving effect of the
    Construction sector.

    The impact of investment programs on sectors with different profiles showcases the need
    to have a strategic mix of investment programs which optimize the outcomes in respect
    to key targets like: a) a high driving effect on the economy; b) a high return of
    investment; c) high social impact.

    The results (see Table 1 and 2) underline the specificity of the infrastructure investment
    program which excels in its capacity to have a stimulating effect on the economy, increasing
    the volume of economic activities, but has a smaller capacity to generate on the short term
    a high return of investment due to the nature of the program. At the same t ime, the
    program generates significant increases in income, due to the high nominal value of the
    investment.


    Annex 1.1. Algebraic description of the methodology
    The input-output model is a linear system of equations based on the Leontief production
    function and a specific vector of final demand. The balance between total inputs and
    outputs are reflected by the following equations:

                                                                                                (1)



Where xi,j are the intermediates from sector i to sector j, x i,d represents the final demand
for commodity i, xi represents the output of sector i.
Assuming a Leontief type of production function, relation 1 is written under the form:



                                                                                                (2)



Where ai,j = xi,j/xj are the input coefficient for domestic intermediates

By algebraically manipulating relation 2 we obtain the fallowing relation:



                                                                                                (3)



In the matrix form relation 3 can be written as:

                                                        X = (I-A)-1 Y                           (4)

Where A is the matrix of input coefficients, I is the unit matrix, (I-A)-1 is the Leontief inverse,
X is the vector of output and Y is the vector of final demand.

Relation (4) is expressed in differences so to isolate the impact of the structural relations
between the sectors of the economy.

                                                        ΔX = (I -A)-1 ΔY                        (5)

Relation (5) is used to analyze the impact of changes of final demand on output changes.



With the same token relations (6) and (7) are used to analyze the impact of changes of final
demand on value added and compensation of employees’ changes133

Annex 2. Assessing Investment Needs Generated by Climate
Change Risks

This section develops a simple risk assessment methodology to generate a risk mapping for
the main climate change induced risks (floods, drought, snow storms, and freezes). The
main message is that the mapping of risk at the county level may provide useful
information for risk management policies such as insurance for climate change induced
risks, as well as good information for assessing public funds required to respond to such
events.


Risk assessment

Measuring frequencies/probabilities
Risk is given by the frequency (probability) of an event multiplied by the damage produced.
The climate change events considered here are generated by the combined effects of
temperature and precipitations. To be able to assess probabilities of temperatures being
under/above given values and of the precipitations to be under/above their determined
limits, the data from the NAM, is used, that contain the monthly averaged 30 years’ time
series of temperatures and precipitations for each county of Romania. The values are
spatially averaged for each county from the data recorded by the monitoring networks
described above.

From this sets of basic data several probability distributions are calculated that best fit the
temperature time series and the precipitations time series in each county. In order to make
basic calculations only the normal distributions determined for each parameter and each
county, have been considered, that give the respective average and standard deviation
values. The use of large amount of data is also helping to determine probability distribution
functions that integrate the short term fluctuations of the parameters’ values. The exercise
done here is intended as a basic example that can be (and it is recommended to be)
extended to short term fluctuations, extreme values distributions, combined effects e.g. of
melting snow and rain, expected damage distributions for each county, etc.

Having these distributions, based on real data, allows for the calculation of the probabilities
of each parameter and of their combinations. Thus there are two options for temperature
and two options for the precipitation that combine with each option of temperature
resulting in 4 events as depicted in the figure below. The probabilities are calculated for the
year following the time series of data – each new year adds new data that may change the
distribution parameters, after a new distribution calculation is done.

The event tree resulting at the level of each county is presented, as an example, chosen at
random, for Argeş County. For illustration an excerpt of the optimal fit distributions is
presented below, although the normal distributions with their moments’ values are used in
the assessment done for each county.

Note: the limit between low and high temperatures is zero degrees Celsius (this makes the difference between
rain and snow in terms of precipitations). More complex scenarios may be considered where the melting snow
combines with rain at above freezing temperatures thus acting as an aggravating element. The event tree in
such cases will be extended to accommodate for more options. This report is only providing an example of
mapping and not an extended risk evaluation.



Assessing damage
The other component of risk is damage associated with each type of event and for each
county. Here the data is not as diversified as in the case of the monitored parameters. The
basic sources are the UNSDR database for Romania (average values for floods and
droughts), and the data on interventions of the EU solidarity fund (values of damage for
snow and freeze), also data on floods provided in a World Bank project on Hazard risk in




                                                                                                       208
Romania associated to floods and a World Bank study on climate change risk in ECA134
provides some general estimations. Based on these data, average damage per type of
event have been determined that were considered the same for each county. Since this
study is just opening the way to more elaborate and systematic determinations, this
approximation is used to determine the county risk values per type of climate change event
taken into consideration. The sum of these risks is presented in the section on combined
risks. The values considered (see Annex 2.3) for the damage per type of event are the
following:

          1)   Flood – 328 millions US$/event
          2)   Drought – 250 millions US$/event
          3)   Snow – 300 millions US$/event
          4)   Freeze – 300 millions US$/event

These values are just for orientation and are considered equal for each county. A thorough
program of determination of damage associated to the above events for each county is
necessary to be implemented for a very detailed risk assessment. It is also important to
note that the type of analysis done here is not an extreme value analysis for the resulting
four events. The purpose of this exercise is to assess the correlation between the
climatologic parameters (temperature and precipitation) with the potential outcome
events described above using an event tree method.

The Peak over Threshold method is not used here to determine extreme values associated
to a given distribution in order to determine the Exceedance Probability curves. Also given
is the basic assumption that damage is the same for all counties it is not the purpose of this
report to determine a Farmer curve. The values for the data series are fitted to a normal
distribution such that to have a possibility for calculating probabilities of various scenarios
of parameters’ values (such as negative or positive temperatures etc.). The damage is
considered the same for all counties (and a further research program to determine the
distributed damage is strongly recommended). The resulting risk is measured for the year
after the data series and every new real data that adds to the series requires a new
determination of the distributions to assess probabilities. Moreover, the damage is
changed by investments allocated for mitigation measures such as flood protection
systems, retention areas, water releases from dams upstream, etc. These changes are able
to assess new values for damage that determine new investment allocation.

The climate change risks maps
The risks of the climate change events mentioned above are calculated as the product of
the probability and the damage. The resulting maps for each risk at the county level are
presented below. In each map (of the four types of hazard risks described above) there are
four (e.g. for the flood risk) or more (e.g. for the snow risk) ranges of risk values to
facilitate, in each case, a better perception of the main differences.

Flood risk map
The first map is the one on flood risk. Here the Northwest and the East and South parts of
the country are the most affected along with the counties positioned along the Danube. In
fact, the affected areas by the 2005 floods were found in the same area. One should
mention though that there is an effect of the precipitations outside of Romania that are
brought in by the Danube, which is not considered here.

Drought risk map
The drought risk has a similar pattern to the flood risk which seems normal since river
basins that in some years produce floods, in other years are subject to lower precipitation
and/or higher evaporation and hence to drought. Obviously the detailed probability values
and the damage are different in the two cases. Another observation to make here is the
fact that the investments required to protect against the floods effects are not the same as
the ones relating to manage the effects of drought.

Snow risk map
The risk associated with heavy snow falling is presenting a different pattern, than the
previous events, for the counties of Romania. This time the East and Center areas are most
affected while the seaside and the Southwest (that has a Mediterranean climate) are less
prone to heavy snow. The mountains area shows high snow risk values, while the East and
Southeast plains regions have a sizeable risk too.

Freeze risk
The pattern of freeze risk is similar to the pattern of snow storm risk. Covasna County is
known as the pole of frost in Romania has the highest likely incidence of freeze events. As
in the case of snow risk, the East and Southeast plains have a higher exposure to frost than
the West of Romania.

The combined climate change effect risks
In order to map risks associated with each county a tool was built in Excel, where the value
of risk for each county is inserted into the cases associated with the surface of the said
county. The total climate change events risk map – summing the separated risks presented
above – is given below


Total Climate Change Risks (in $1,000)




The interesting thing is that the counties with the highest likelihood of climate change
events are also among the least developed counties in Romania. These counties also have
less of their own resources for mitigating climate change events and may be more reliant
on central government transfers to help them mitigate such risks.

         implementation of the given intervention;
    4) there is an infringement of the principles of financing the given intervention
         applicable to the given funding source;
    5) the entity responsible for implementation of the priority interventions is giving up
