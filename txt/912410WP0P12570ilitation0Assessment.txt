       Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
X II   An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
   Executive Summary
A Transport and Trade Facilitation Assessment (TTFA) is designed as a snapshot of a country’s trading
environment, viewed from the perspective of four key industries. In Cambodia’s case, the industries selected
were rice, garments, footwear and silk. This report dissects the inputs and outputs of each of these sectors
by analyzing how the inputs to each industry arrive at the processing plant and are then exported. Each
step of the value chain is examined for logistics issues and recommendations are made at the conclusion
of each chapter. The analysis and recommendations are designed to provide an overview of logistics issues
that affect the private sector in general in Cambodia.

This report is designed to be read as an adjunct to the Trade Corridor Performance Assessment that
accompanies this report. The TTFA is not a tool by which to measure performance, but rather a tool to assist
policymakers to understand the current trading environment. The TTFA includes recommendations based
on the ﬁndings of each industry surveyed. These recommendations could become the basis of trade- related
technical assistance projects to be carried out by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), perhaps in
conjunction with development partners. In Cambodia, the funding of such projects could include the major
sources of funding to the Cambodian trade sector wide-approach (SWAp), namely the Trade Development
Support Program and the Enhanced Integrated Framework CEDEP Program.

Cambodia’s exports have grown strongly over the past ten years, in part boosted by its accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2004. Despite this strong performance, Cambodia’s weak logistics
performance, coupled with bottlenecks caused by gaps in infrastructure and services, together with limited
storage facilities and inefﬁcient border clearance procedures, continue to hamper exports. Trade facilitation
and logistics are therefore key issues in realizing Cambodia’s full export potential. The Government is fully
aware of the importance of addressing the constraints. To this end, it has introduced signiﬁcant reforms in
Customs and is currently implementing a national single window as part of its Association of South East Asian
Nations (ASEAN) commitments.

However, in addition to the broad improvements taking place, the main export sectors of Cambodia—in terms
of actual performance and potential—have speciﬁc needs that need to be identiﬁed in turn. Garment
exports are part of a supply chain that requires speed and reliability in delivery. Rice needs good internal
freight connections from ﬁelds to border and adapted storage facilities. Cambodia’s supply chain
performance also faces the curse of size—not enough scale to justify large investments or improve efﬁciency—
while its main competitors (Vietnam, China and Bangladesh) all enjoy the advantage of economies of scale.
Cambodia’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) ranking improved signiﬁcantly in 2012, jumping 29 places.
Nonetheless, Cambodia’s logistics performance is still well below major competitors such as Thailand and
Vietnam. Several of the supply chains are also controlled by external buyers rather than local producers. Not
only it is important to improve trade facilitation at a national level, it is also critical to address the speciﬁc
requirements of its key export sectors.

    Sectoral ﬁndings
    Rice has recently gained much attention, especially with the food security agenda gaining regional and
    global prominence. The TTFA report analyzes the rice sector from a domestic market perspective with a
    view to its potential as an export industry. The rice sector suffers from a lack of large milling facilities, a
    method to aggregate the supply of raw padi, and a dependence on road transport, with its higher attendant
    costs. Lack of access to domestic credit creates a market advantage for Thai and Vietnamese traders by
    allowing them to purchase a large amount of Cambodia’s crop at harvest time. Millers are only beginning
    to offer drying and storage facilities, but in general the farmers and millers require fast cash payment to
    clear the harvest. Rice is bagged at the mills away from major trade corridors. It is transported to
    Phnom Penh by road and shipped through Sihanoukville or Ho Chi Minh City. The efﬁciency constraints of
    the current logistics methods are dealt with in detail in the rice chapter found below.

    To improve the export performance of the rice sector from a logistics perspective, the government can
    encourage public private partnerships in establishing new facilities for storing and drying padi near the growing
    areas and operated by mills or third parties. The government also needs to upgrade trade corridors connecting
    rice growing areas to loading points for international shipments, which is likely to include development of the
    river transport corridor to Vietnam and simpliﬁed procedures at the border or provisions for movement of
    trucks across the border with Thailand.

    The garments value chain is unique in the sense that this industry constitutes the bulk of Cambodia’s
    export value. Cambodia’s garment sector consists of two types of manufacturers: vendor factories and
    contract manufacturers. The size and type of each order is largely determined overseas by head ofﬁce or
    by a foreign buyer, with very little design input from the local factory. The dependence of local factories on
    decisions made overseas extends into sourcing of inputs, shipping arrangements and even access to ﬁnance.
    Factories are provided the inputs, instructed about the shipping preference of the buyer and, in some cases,

provided credit from the buyer to meet the speciﬁcation and delivery of the order. The logistics of the garment
industry are complicated by the need to import inputs into the industry and to match these against exports. The
manufacturers continue to report difﬁculties in processing duty-free inputs and report delays in exports related
to licensing requirements and inspections.

To improve logistics speciﬁc to the garment sector, resolving inefﬁciencies in trade facilitation and border
procedures are critical. This is because proﬁt margins are low in the garment sector and any improvement in
logistics that reduces costs and increases the reliability of delivery will lead to higher proﬁts across the industry.
The garment sector will beneﬁt from consolidation of services amongst manufacturers, particularly contract
factories, in order to derive faster turn-around of inputs into the manufacturing process. These could take the
form of clusters. The skills of the workers need to be upgraded; to this end, the RGC may wish to consider
linking with the industry advocacy group—the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC)—to
create an institute that could address the needs of worker skill upgrading.

The footwear sector exhibits robust growth. In footwear, as in garments, the differentiation between vendor
and contract factories is crucial in understanding the value-chain. The growth of the footwear industry
demonstrates one important difference from rice and garments, however, in that the value of each unit of output
has been growing at the same time that the volume of the exports have increased. This growth in unit value
seems to imply that the footwear industry is climbing the value chain in sophistication and quality.

Improving the logistics supply chain in footwear requires concerted initiatives to upgrade worker skills
and initiatives to further develop a cluster approach for supply industries that could support the footwear
manufacturing process and reduce order cycles. These initiatives may be usefully housed within an enclave
that fosters the development of footwear factories—an approach that is currently only somewhat possible
within Special Economic Zones (SEZs). An enclave approach would allow the various factors of production to
be integrated and closely sourced thus shortening the order cycle and production cycle. Financing is also a
constraint to further strengthening of this value chain, which may be remedied by public-private approaches
to ﬁll the credit intermediation gap.

The silk sector in Cambodia is largely informal, small-scale and is difﬁcult to deﬁne as a stand-alone industry
in its current form. The sector is characterized by small-scale orders for tourist or domestic consumption. The
orders tend to be of low volume, irregular supply and are dependent on low-quantity inputs from Vietnam and
China. As such, the current structure of the industry does not lend itself to further consolidation or even to
‘moving up’ the value chain. The transport logistics are relatively simple—the low quantities sold are generally
transported by air or sea to fulﬁll small order of less than 6kg in weight.

The fate of the silk sector depends on whether the Government wishes to promote this sector as a major export
product or keep it as a cottage industry. For Cambodia to become a major exporter of silk, the industry would
need to undergo signiﬁcant consolidation and mechanization. For Cambodia to differentiate itself from major
silk exporters such as Thailand or China, the quality and design and color of the silks produced in Cambodia
would need to be more innovative than at present. Finally, industry standards would need to be agreed and
enforced.

The ﬁndings from the survey were used to identify a number of improvements that could be introduced to
heighten trade competitiveness in the key sectors mentioned above. These are summarized in Table 1. While
there is a need to modify the supply chain management strategies in order to improve trade competitiveness, the
most important involves restructuring the inbound supply chains to improve the reliability of supply of inputs.
However, speciﬁc initiatives vary by trade. For rice and silk, the principal initiatives are to increase integration
in the inbound supply chains and increase the contracting of supplies as a means to improve the reliability and
quality of supply. In the case of garments and footwear, the principal initiatives focus on the development of
clusters and complementary zones to increase the efﬁciency of production and attract additional investment.
As for improvements in logistics services, the principal initiative would be to improve the performance along
the trade corridor linking the production sites with the port terminals.

     Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
     An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
       1. Methodology and Organization
                   of Phase II TTFA

    1.1 Methodology
    The Transport and Trade Facilitation Assessment (TTFA) is a tool developed by the World Bank to evaluate
    the competitiveness of a country’s trade and the quality of logistics services used for this trade. The tool
    has two components. The ﬁrst focuses on public policy that affects trade and logistics. The second
    examines the performance of supply chains used by importers and exporters. Both components utilize
    background research and interviews to identify current constraints and opportunities related to improving
    competitiveness and quality of service. Phase I utilizes a series of interviews with key decision makers
    and associations involved in trade. Phase II, a survey of participants in supply chains for selected trades,
    includes logistics service providers. This report presents the results of the TTFA performed in 2011.

    The primary objective of performing this assessment is to identify and prioritize initiatives to sustain the
    growth of the country’s rapidly expanding trade and to increase the amount of value added provided within the
    country. In order to accomplish this, four trades were selected and the structure of their supply chains was
    determined. The activities in the product-speciﬁc supply chains were analyzed to determine their impact on the
    competitiveness of the traded goods. This analysis examined four key areas:

             The performance of the supply chains as measured in terms of time, cost and reliability of end-to-end
             movements;
             The uncertainties associated with individual activities in the supply chain;
             The ﬂexibility and transparency of these supply chains; and
             The transactions generated by these activities and the transfer of risk as a result of these transactions.

    Some of the opportunities for enhancing trade competitiveness were examined as part of the assessment, for
    example:

       1.    Improvements in the organization and control of both inbound and outbound supply chains
       2.    Increased coordination among supply chain participants
       3.    Improvements in performance of logistics services
       4.    Introduction of value-addition logistics in the supply chains
       5.    Increased use of ITC to enhance supply chain performance
       6.    Improvement in the utilization and performance of trade corridors and production clusters
       7.    Increased scale of production and diversiﬁcation of products

    The types of initiatives that support these opportunities include:

       1.    Technical assistance
       2.    Standards and contractual relationships
       3.    Financial instruments tailored to speciﬁc requirements
       4.    Regulatory reform
       5.    IT platforms
       6.    Investments in infrastructure

1.2 Organization of the survey
The Phase II TTFA was conducted in four steps over a six-month period. The ﬁrst step was a review of the issues
facing the logistics industry and identiﬁcation of commodity-speciﬁc trades to be surveyed. Four trades were
selected based on their size and contribution to the country’s trade, both now and in the future. These were:

Subsequently, ﬁrms interviewed were selected based on size,1 market, supply chain structure, track record
and accessibility.2 For each commodity, ﬁrms were selected to include different categories of products and
different levels of integration of their supply chains.

The second step involved preparation of survey instruments, selection and mobilization of the survey team,
pre-testing the instruments and arranging the ﬁeld logistics. The instruments were prepared using the
formats provided in the TTFA manual. These were substantially modiﬁed to reﬂect the situation in the
country as well as the speciﬁc objectives. The largest adjustment was to give greater emphasis to interviews
with the ﬁrms that organize the supply chains and less to the ﬁrms that provide the logistics services used
in the supply chains.

The team was organized by Emerging Markets Consultants (EMC). Team members were selected according
to their familiarity with the commodity-speciﬁc trades as well as with trade logistics. A separate team was
selected to conduct expert interviews for trade ﬁnance, transport and freight forwarding/customs clearance.
The teams participated in a three-day training course that covered the analysis of different aspects to trade
logistics and the structure of the survey instruments. The instruments and interview techniques were
pre-tested with a ﬁrm not included in the sample. Although the members of the team were ﬂuent in English,
the questionnaires were translated to ensure consistency in the interviews. Finally the survey team was
organized into pairs with each assigned two trades.

The third step was the ﬁeldwork, which was conducted in two stages. Two trades were surveyed in each
phase. The interviewers were sent out in pairs in order to ensure a broad understanding of the ﬁrm’s activities
and to improve the interview dynamics. Four interviews were conducted with each ﬁrm responsible for
organizing the supply chains. The ﬁrst meeting was an introductory session with the general manager to
introduce the study team, review the approach and discuss the ﬁrm’s business model. The second meeting
was with the company’s logistics manager to discuss the organization of his supply chains. The third meeting
was with the head of ﬁnance to learn about the cash ﬂows and ﬁnance associated with the ﬁrm’s trade
activities. The ﬁnal meeting was a recap with the general manager to discuss strategies for enhancing the
efﬁciency of operations and improving trade competitiveness. Where required, additional interviews were
held with the ﬁrm’s principal suppliers and buyers. Between the two phases, meetings were held to discuss
preliminary ﬁndings and the survey team ﬁnalized their ﬁeld notes and prepared some preliminary essays to
document their ﬁndings.

The expert interviews were conducted in parallel with ﬁrms providing clearing and forwarding services,
transport companies and banks involved in trade ﬁnance. Most of the interviews were conducted in English
or alternatively, in Khmer.

For the ﬁnal step, the survey results were analyzed. This included preparing for each trade

          a consolidated form listing the responses of the ﬁrms,
          essays describing problems and possible initiatives for improving performance,
          ﬂowcharts for the supply chains for some of the ﬁrms, and
          cash ﬂows for some of the ﬁrms.

    The survey ﬁndings were combined with earlier efforts to map out the characteristics of each trade, the
    different business models applied, the various conﬁgurations of inbound and outbound supply chain, the level
    of control over the operation of the supply chains exercised by individual ﬁrms, the cash-to-cash cycle and
    ﬁnancing requirements for different business models, and the availability and performance characteristics
    of the logistics services used in these supply chains. Based on the results, policy recommendations were
    developed for both the private and public sector or joint initiatives proposed. Preliminary ﬁndings were
    presented at industry-workshops followed by a more detailed discussion with the associations representing
    each of the trades.

1.3 Key concepts
The analysis of the trades is organized around two key concepts. The trade itself is deﬁned as an inbound
supply chain linking production of raw materials with the processing of these materials and an outbound supply
chain linking processing with the delivery of ﬁnished products to foreign markets. The activities in these chains
were limited to those controlled by actors in the country. For this purpose, the entities involved in organizing
the supply chains (the organizing principals) were identiﬁed. These enterprises connect the inbound supply
chain delivering inputs and the outbound supply chain for international shipment of the ﬁnished products. In
most cases these entities were involved in some form of transformation of the inputs. The activities of the
organizing principal were categorized according to their business model and span of control over both inbound
and outbound logistics.

The business model refers to both the transformation performed on the inputs and the characteristics of
the outputs produced. The span of control refers to their involvement in the activities of the inbound and
outbound supply chains. Separate business models were used for manufactured goods and agricultural
products. For the manufactured goods, the standard delineation is based on value addition, as shown in
Table 2. This includes not only value addition in physical terms but also in terms of design and marketing of
the product. For agricultural products, a similar method is applied where value-added includes the extent of
processing. Hence, it distinguishes between traders, suppliers, and distributors, as shown in Table 3.

                                               An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   9
 For each of the trades studied, there is a mix of business models being applied and, in most cases, a gradual
 evolution is occurring towards those providing more value-added. The analysis therefore examines the
 initiatives required to encourage this evolution. By focusing on the span of control, this study addresses the
 organization of both the inbound and outbound supply chains. Speciﬁcally it considers the extent of control of
 the organizing principal over the activities within the supply chains. This will usually increase as the business
 model evolves in order to:

             ensure a more regular reliable ﬂow of goods through the supply chain,
             improve the quality of the inputs, and
             provide distribution channels for speciﬁc markets.

     The span of control has two dimensions: (1) how far the involvement extends upstream in the activities of
     inbound supply chains and downstream in the activities of the outbound supply chains, and (2) the mechanism
     used to control these activities. Generally, there are a variety of mechanisms ranging from direct involvement
     through investment and operational control to restructuring the transactions with the providers of these
     activities. The latter includes among others:

           simplifying the transactions,
           improving enforcement of contracts, and
           providing more ﬂexible ﬁnancial terms to ensure reasonable distribution of the beneﬁts among the
           participants in the supply chains.

            2. Rice
     2.1 Trade and markets
     The rice sector in Cambodia consists of about 2.9 million rice farms with an average area of less than
     2 hectares and producing about 3.0-3.5 tons of padi per year.3 Total production of padi grew at about
     8 percent per year from 2000 to 2010 due both to an increase in the average yield and harvested area
     (Figure 2). The increase in yield was achieved through various means including expansion of irrigation
     infrastructure; increased use of high yielding varieties; and an intensiﬁcation of the crop cycle allowing
     double cropping. Although the average productivity is considerably below the global average, it is comparable
     with Thailand, the largest rice exporting country, which has an average yield of 2.88 tons/ha.4

     The current market structure provides few incentives for higher quality varieties of rice because the output of
     many smallholders is collated for sale. Since the transactions include padi collected from a number of farms
     that grow different varieties, for non-aromatic padi there is little differentiation in price based on variety. As a
     result there are few incentives for farmers to worry about varieties and moisture content. Similarly, the local
     market does not pay a premium for well-milled rice or rice with a limited number of brokens, so most millers
     do not attempt to optimize the quality of the milled rice. The tests for Genetically Modiﬁed Organism (GMO)
     are performed in laboratories in Vietnam or Thailand. Targeted initiatives to reward farmers and traders by
     differentiating between different qualities of rice may improve the value of the ﬁnal sale.

     The exporters who operate mills sometimes purchase semi-milled rice from smaller mills paying cash at the
     time of delivery and provide an advance to assist the small mills in purchasing padi. The semi-milled rice
     receives additional processing, including polishing and sorting, at the exporters’ facilities. Transport for these
     larger shipments is organized using local transport companies.

     Some of the larger mills sometimes purchase padi directly from growers’ associations or through contract
     farming arrangements. In this situation, they are concerned with quality and will provide funding for inputs and
     advise farmers on seed selection. This is a relatively new initiative and provides a good model for the future
     direction of the industry.

     The inbound supply chain is characterized by limited storage facilities. The mills store enough padi to ﬁll orders
     for 3-4 months after the harvest season. Their storage facilities are also used to dry the padi prior to milling,
     though this drying is generally inexpert and therefore long-term storage is restricted. Some mills use silos for
     drying and a few have recently acquired mechanical dryers but the majority of mills store the padi in bags in
     warehouses, thereby limiting its shelf-life.

departing through Sihanoukville or Phnom Penh, but beginning in 2011 uncontainerized rice was barged down
the Mekong River to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Milled rice is exported in 50kg bags except for high-valued
fragrant rice, which is sometimes shipped in 2kg bags or smaller packages. Due to the limited size of orders and
draft limitations in Sihanoukville, most of the bagged rice is shipped in containers, including lower-value rice
that would normally be shipped as general cargo. The exception is rice produced from padi that is transported
from Cambodia to Vietnam, milled, mixed with Vietnamese rice, bagged and then loaded on general cargo
vessels in the terminals in Ho Chi Minh City.10

Most of the mills are located away from the river at the intersection of a major trade corridor and the rural road
network serving the growing area. The rice is bagged at the mill and transported by road to Phnom Penh where
it is stuffed in containers for shipment by road to Sihanoukville or transported by barge to loading points near
Saigon port. The domestic movement accounts for a relatively high proportion of the costs—trucking costs are
reasonable by international standards but the expenses related to informal tolls on truck transport and freight
forwarding are high. These were studied in greater detail in the World Bank’s Transport Corridor Assessment.

The formal movement of rice is costly by international standards and is constrained by the limited supply of
appropriate 20-foot food containers. As a result of the high freight forwarding costs discussed above, container
transport is relatively expensive per ton kilometer and is constrained by limited availability of empty 20-foot
containers suitable for transport of food. Most of the containers unloaded in Sihanoukville are 40-foot boxes
carrying inputs for the garment industry or 20-foot boxes carrying equipment and other goods not compatible
with food shipments. Therefore, it is necessary to reposition empty 20-foot boxes from Singapore to Phnom
Penh or Sihanoukville for loading rice destined to Europe.

Financial
The availability of working capital also limits activity throughout the supply chain from the amount of padi a
collector can buy to the order size that a trader or mill can accept. The lack of access to sufﬁcient working
capital has allowed Thai and Vietnamese traders to dominate the market for Cambodian rice. The farmers
need cash quickly at the time of harvest, which local millers cannot provide due to poor access to credit, so
buyers from across the border are able to purchase the majority of the harvest. Financial transactions on the
inbound supply chain are mostly made in cash. The principal commercial problem is lack of working capital. The
traders rely on their own cash ﬂow and a line of credit from a commercial bank. The terms are about 9 percent
ﬁxed-interest for a one-year loan (foreign exchange).

Working capital remains a serious constraint on the outbound supply chain. An advance is frequently provided
to the trader for purchase of the padi or semi-milled rice. However, nearly all of the shipments are FOB with
payment made a ﬁxed period after loading the cargo.

2.5 Supply chain performance
The ﬁrms interviewed were both rice exporters that purchased milled rice from local mills and miller- exporters
who purchased padi from collectors. They export both white and fragrant rice, primarily to Europe. Two were
large, handling 20,000-25,000 tons per year while two were niche players handling 3,000-6 ,000 tons per year.




10
     Sihanoukville Port has a maximum draft of only 8 meters for general cargo vessels. Also it lacks continuous cargo handling operations and sufficient
     bonded storage for efficient transfer of bagged rice.



                                                                                             Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                                                       An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)             15
     Segregating the types of non-aromatic padi allows traders to extract additional value from the crop. The average
     unit cost for semi-milled rice is US$300-US$500 per ton for white rice and US$650-US$750 for jasmine rice.
     The semi-milled rice and padi is delivered to their facility by the supplier usually within a day. The size of the
     orders varies with the smaller traders ordering less than 100 tons at a time. The milled and polished rice is
     sold primarily to foreign importers on FOB terms. Some of the fragrant rice is sold on CFR terms to foreign
     retailers and distributors.

     The typical size of export shipments varies from 3 to 15 TEU. However, smaller traders will ship a single TEU,
     especially for fragrant rice. The minimum shipment size for larger traders is usually 5 TEU and they accept
     orders with multiple shipments. The time from conﬁrmation of the order to loading on the ship is 5-14 days.
     The order cycle from order conﬁrmation to delivery to the buyer’s warehouse is 35-42 days for Europe but can
     be as little as 14 days for East Asia and less for Southeast Asia. The percentage of delayed shipments varies
     by trader but is generally 10 percent or less. Most delays are a result of problems in the outbound supply chain
     including

           lack of reliability in terms of domestic transport,
           availability of 20’ containers suitable for carrying food,
           inefﬁcient handling at the loading port, and
           lack of availability of customs ofﬁcials.

     There are no signiﬁcant problems with documentation for the exports but the tests can be an impediment.
     The times for acquiring the necessary export documentation are:

           Certiﬁcate of Origin about - 3 days,
           Phytosanitary certiﬁcate - 7 days
           Fumigation certiﬁcate – 1 day,
           Quantity certiﬁcate – 4 days, and
           Chemical tests - 7-12 days.


 2.6 Objectives and strategies
 General objective and strategy
 Since most of Cambodia’s exportable surplus is informally shipped to Thailand and Vietnam as padi,
 the current objective of the government is to increase the formal exports of milled rice. The country
 generates sufﬁcient surplus to reach the government’s target of one million tons per year, but there are a
 number of logistics problems, only one of which is lack of modern milling capacity - especially that of
 sufﬁcient size to accept larger orders. Meeting this target will signiﬁcantly increase the value of the
 exports but equally signiﬁcant gains can be achieved by increasing the quality of rice exports. Both efforts
 require a restructuring of the inbound supply chains which are currently based on small-scale operations.
 While the increase in exports of milled rice can be achieved through a short-term strategy, the improvement in
 quality of the rice requires a longer term strategy.

 Given the current concentration in rice export trading business, the most expedient strategy for increasing
 the share of local padi production that is processed in and exported from Cambodia, would be to encourage
 larger traders to invest in modern rice-polishing factories and rice mills. This would take advantage of the
 existing collection system but expand it to include the purchase of padi that otherwise will be smuggled to
 neighboring countries. This requires private investment in facilities to improve the outbound supply chains and
 public initiatives to simplify trade regulations and encourage competition. Complementing this strategy, there
 should be a shift in the outbound supply chain from a system based on spot market sales to one based on
 supplying rice under an extended shipping period.



          Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
16        An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
In the medium term, the strategy would shift to increasing the yield and improving the quality of both padi
and processing. This requires a more integrated inbound supply chain that provides incentives to improve
agricultural practices. It also requires a change in the organizing principal from exporters who do not own
factories to miller-exporters and polisher-exporters that sell directly to international traders and distributors.

2.7 Implementation
Inbound supply chains will be strengthened by the current trend of increasing the size and efﬁciency of
rice mills. The larger capacity of these mills implies a more efﬁcient system for collecting padi to achieve
economies of scale. This begins with a more efﬁcient mechanism for aggregation of padi in order to reduce
the cost of delivery to the larger mills. New facilities for storing and drying padi need to be established near the
growing areas and operated by mills or third parties. The mills would purchase the padi either from the farm
or from these facilities and would maintain their inventory at this facility removing it just before for milling.
These facilities would allow greater ﬂexibility in locating new mills, especially at locations that provide direct
access to the inland waterways. Existing mills located close to the areas of production would use these facilities
to supplement their own storage. The resulting restructuring of the inbound supply chain is shown in Figure 4.

A sustainable mechanism for improving the quality of export rice requires coordination between the public
and private sectors. This could begin with encouraging traders to operate their own mills either through tax
incentives or with certiﬁcation/licensing requirements. The growth in volume of trade will increase the overall
demand for working capital. The increase in the size of mills and export orders will increase the amount of
working capital required by individual mills. The increase period of storage in order to reduce moisture content
and extend the period of milling will lengthen the cash-to-cash cycles. As a result of these changes, the ﬁnancial
instruments used to provide working capital need to be modiﬁed to reduce the cost and collateral requirements
while increasing the borrowing limit and tenor.

 Improvements in performance on the outbound supply chains require upgrading the trade corridors connecting
 the rice growing areas to the loading points for international shipments. These corridors include those used by:

            Aromatic rice transport by road from the Northwest through Poipet to Laem Chabang for container
            shipments and through Khlong Toey for general cargo shipments;
            Aromatic, traditional and high yield varieties transported by barge to Ho Chi Minh Port port for loading
            general cargo ships;
            Aromatic, traditional and high yield varieties transported by truck to Sihanoukville for loading on general
            cargo vessels; and
            Aromatic, traditional and high-yield varieties transported by road to Phnom Penh for stufﬁng in containers
            and either loaded in Phnom Penh Port or trucked to Sihanoukville Port for loading on container vessels.

 The ﬁrst two corridors require simpliﬁed procedures at the borders and the provision for movement of
 trucks across the border. The second requires simpliﬁed transit procedures based on the 2009 agreement
 between Vietnam and Cambodia on Waterway Transportation.11 All four would provide economies of
 scale for the general cargo shipments and improve connectivity for container shipments. They would
 also provide shorter transit times, more competitive services and lower freight rates for both container
 and general cargo shipments.

 Although there have been considerable improvement in documentation and transport services in recent
 years, further improvements will be required to support a signiﬁcant increase in export volumes. The
 problems associated with obtaining a Certificate of Origin (CO) have been reduced and international
 certiﬁcation and inspection ﬁrms now operate in Cambodia. However, the procedures for preparation
 and approval of trade documentation need to be simpliﬁed and clearance times for exports of large
 shipments of rice need to be shortened. Currently, the Government is working on a one-window strategy but
 there is also a need for:

            Allowing non-governmental agencies such as Chamber of Commerce to CO prior to shipment,
            Licensing of private, certiﬁed testing facilities to perform phytosanitary, fumigation and GMO tests, and
            Automating the submission and processing of the additional documents introduced as part of bilateral
            trade agreements.


 Recommendations
            Facilitate greater investment in padi storage and drying facilities, perhaps by underwriting risk from
            commercial banks to encourage lending into the rice sector and reduce the cost of working capital
            sought by millers to buy rice at the end of each season.
            The RGC may wish to engage short-term agricultural experts to advise on the optimal location of these
            storing and drying facilities.
            Facilitate the creation of agricultural cooperatives in order to aggregate supply and tighten the supply
            chain in terms of quality and regularity of rice.
            Ensure that Cambodia and Vietnam jointly implement simpliﬁed transit agreements according to the
            Waterways Transportation Agreement of 2009.
            The preparation and issuance of Certiﬁcates of Origin will need to be expedited through more efﬁcient
            procedures, perhaps by implementing an automated web-based approach, or allowing issuance of
            these certiﬁcates by industry groups such as the Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia.

      The purpose of the present Agreement is to establish a legal framework for the effective implementation of freedom of navigation in the
      Mekong river system, and to create favorable conditions for transit and cross-border

 3.1 Trade
 Garments have provided the solid backbone to Cambodia’s export-led growth story over the past decade. The
 industry has tripled its share in the global market place over that period, yet it still faces constraints in its
 ability to lead the growth of Cambodia’s economy up the value chain or in leading towards greater and more
 sophisticated export product diversity. The beneﬁts and limitations of the current industry structure shall be
 examined below.

 The value of Cambodia’s garment exports grew at a relatively uniform rate until the global ﬁnancial crisis,
 which caused a temporary contraction (Figure 5). Similarly, the contribution of the apparel industry to GDP has
 risen from around 1 percent in the early 1990s to about 10 percent in 2009. Cambodia’s contribution to global
 garment trade, however, remains small, growing to about 0.95 percent in 2011 from a very low base.

 The growth in exports has been achieved through an increase in foreign investment, which led in turn to
 rapid growth in the number of factories and associated employment. The majority of garment factories in
 Cambodia are owned by investors from Taiwan, China, and, Hong Kong. Only about 6 percent are owned by
 local investors. The average level of employment per factory is about 1,100 employees. About one quarter
 of the ﬁrms employs less than 500 workers while the larger ﬁrms employ between 6,000 and 9,000.
 Locally-owned factories average less than 600 workers and Chinese ﬁrms about 650.12 The balance of social
 welfare beneﬁts accruing from the garment sector, the most direct of which is employment, thus rests in
 the hands of foreign investors.

 If the beneﬁts of foreign investment are clear, the potential instability of Cambodia’s reliance on foreign
 investment in the garment industry was also illustrated in the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008. The contraction
 in garment exports beginning in 2008 brought a halt to new investments and a number of factories closed

while others merged. The fast pace of recovery since 2010, however, has allowed exports to return to
pre-crisis levels, though employment and the number of factories and the management structure have
remained relatively unchanged (Figure 6). Recently, there has been renewed interest from foreign investors in
relocating garment factories to Cambodia and a number of proposals for investment are awaiting government
approval.

Cambodia serves a relatively small number of markets with a limited number of products. The principal export
destination is North America followed by the EU, as shown in Figure 7. ASEAN accounts for less than 1 percent
of garment exports, most of which is rag trade sent to Singapore, presumably for re-export. The concentration
on markets in the US and EU has been encouraged by the various trade agreements that provide preferential
access.

 Exports are mostly large shipments of cotton products intended for the low and medium priced market
 segment in the US and, to a lesser extent in the EU. The majority of Cambodia’s garment exports take place in
 four categories: sweaters/pullovers, men’s and women’s trousers, and t-shirts/singlets. These alone account
 for 60 percent of exports. Within these categories the type of products shipped from Cambodia includes knitted
 items such as t-shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts and polo shirts. Exports of woven garments include trousers,
 shirts, and jackets.


 3.2 Business models
 Cambodia’s apparel industry applies a variety of business models. The majority of the factories (more than 80
 percent) are either vendor factories or contract manufacturers. The type of factory ownership may have an
 impact on Cambodia’s ability to move up the garment value chain, as the current structure limits the growth
 in knowledge spillovers from foreign experts into the broader economy. Most of the foreign- owned ﬁrms
 are vendor factories. Their parent companies operate as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) sourcing
 the inputs used by their factories and, in some cases, as Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) providing the
 designs for the goods produced in their factories. Therefore, the factories located in Cambodia tend to be tightly
 controlled by offshore owners, with very little room for local initiative or entrepreneurship.

 The parent company distributes orders among factories that it owns in several countries – including Cambodia
 - according to their available capacity, unit production costs, and required skill level. It then arranges delivery
 of the inputs to the factory according to the buyers’ requests. If the parent company chooses the fabric or
 provides the design, then the vendor factory will provide pre-production samples for the buyer’s approval.
 For the exports, the factory arranges the domestic movement but the parent company or buyer’s nominated
 forwarder arranges the international movement. The factory has little ability to attract orders or identify
 markets into which it could expand.

 Most of the contract manufacturers are foreign-owned but operate as independent enterprises providing
 CMT/Assembly services. Some take orders from buyers who provide the designs and specify the inputs;
 others operate as OEMs, assuming responsibility for sourcing inputs and preparing samples for approval by the
 buyer. A comparison of the supply chains of the vendor factories and contract manufacturers is presented in
 Figure 7, which also indicates who performs each activity (a dual-color box is used for those activities that have
 two possible participants). A few factories operate as ODMs. However, these are generally small operations.
 They produce mostly accessories with the designs prepared by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
 and other social enterprises, which contributes little to Cambodia’s ability to move up the value chain.

 Vendor factories have the advantage of scale through their relation with the parent company, which provides
 access to regional suppliers and global markets. Their parent relationship also provides access to low-cost
 capital borrowed internationally against the parent company’s balance sheet. In contrast, contract
 manufacturers export to a limited number of markets and have difﬁculties in obtaining inputs of consistent
 quality at a competitive price. Furthermore, they lack access to low-cost ﬁnance, making it difﬁcult to
 evolve from the CMT/assembly business model to an OEM. The smaller, locally owned factories produce only
 for the domestic market and sub-contract to larger producers.

 The TTFA report is interested in knowing as much as possible about the upstream and downstream supply
 chain. To that end, the supplier and buyer relationships are important to this analysis of the garment sector.
 Each is examined in turn below. More information on these relationships and the facts and ﬁgures pertaining to
 the supplier and buyer relationship can also be found in the Annex.




      Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
22    An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Suppliers
All the fabrics, threads, accessories and trim used in production of apparel exports must be imported. Only
packaging is produced locally. About 70 percent of the fabric is imported from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong
and another 16 percent from Southeast Asia. The textiles are purchased from the original manufacturer or
their overseas distributors. For the vendor factories, the parent companies have long- standing relations with
these suppliers, a large proportion of which are located in the same country as the parent company.

The contract manufacturers that procure their own inputs do so in accordance with the buyer’s speciﬁcations
and, in many cases, receive a list of authorized suppliers from their buyers.

Buyers
The principal customers for Cambodia’s apparel exports are brand marketers and retail chains. The largest
customers, a selection of which includes famous brand names such as H&M, Levi Strauss, Nike, Adidas, C&A
and Target, account for the majority of Cambodia’s garment exports. GAP alone is estimated to account for 30
percent of total apparel exports. The vendor factories produce garments for larger buyers while most of the
contract manufacturers to sell their garments to buying agents and smaller retailers.

Span of control
As indicated above, the managers of vendor factories in Cambodia have limited participation in their inbound
and outbound supply chains. Aside from production, their only role is to manage the domestic movement,
including clearance and transport. In contrast, the contract manufacturers participate in purchasing inputs
that are imported on a CFR basis and selling their ﬁnished goods on an FOB basis.

3.3 Supply chain performance
Despite continued growth, the apparel industry in Cambodia faces a number of challenges. The immediate
concerns are the rising cost of production due to increasing wages and the high cost of energy. While the value
of exports is expected to grow in the short term as more factories are established, this industry may become
increasingly vulnerable unless changes in the structure and management of factories take place. At the present
time, most factories have minimal investments in ﬁxed assets and can easily relocate if operating costs are no
longer competitive. The main challenge is to solidify the foreign investment in this sector, perhaps by fostering
the span of control of local factories.

In the medium term, the industry needs to move away from basic apparel because of strong competition
from larger exporters such Vietnam, Bangladesh, and China and India that can offer economies of scale. If
it is to compete for the production of higher value goods, then the industry needs to become more efﬁcient
primarily by improving the performance of its inbound and outbound supply chains. Details of the structure
and performance of the supply chain are contained in the following paragraphs. The information contained in
this section is evaluated in following sections and informs the recommendations contained at the end of the
chapter.

As stated earlier, the majority of garment factories produce against conﬁrmed orders that are negotiated
abroad by the parent company. The only inventory is imported inputs awaiting testing, and inputs that are
being consolidated prior to the start of production. The volume of orders varies by season but peak demand is
relatively small, about 20-30 percent above average, because most products have a relatively long shelf live. To
accommodate these peaks, the factories extend their working hours, add production lines and/or subcontract
part of the order.

24    An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
The order cycle from conﬁrmation of order to delivery to the export gateway averages about 90 days. For
smaller orders of simple products, the average is closer to 45 days while for larger orders that require special
fabrics and/or various samples to be approved prior to production the average is closer to 120 days. The
delivery time for imported fabrics is 3-8 weeks and the value of shipments is in the range of US$50,000 to
US$75,000 per TEU. Factories receive consignments on a weekly basis with most shipments organized by the
supplier on a CFR basis. Payments for the imports are made a speciﬁed time after receipt of goods, typically a
week or two, using a telegraphic transfer (TT). For vendor factories, the parent company manages the ﬁnances
and transactions. For local ﬁrms, the transactions often require a Letter of Credit (L/C) and are ﬁnanced by
discounting the buyer’s L/C.

Finished garments are packed and labeled for delivery to retail outlets. The garments are then shipped in ocean
containers to the retailer’s distribution center. Ocean transport is arranged by the buyer’s nominated forwarder.
The containers are loaded at the factory for transport to Sihanoukville Port. The time for overseas shipment
adds 15-35 days to the total order cycle depending on the distance to the overseas destination. Larger orders
are sent in multiple consignments, usually on a weekly basis. Airfreight is used only for time-sensitive or delayed
shipments, which account for 1 percent and 5 percent of the shipments, respectively.

The cost for moving the container from Sihanoukville port to the factory’s warehouse is $700-$900 per
Forty Foot Equivalent Unit (FEU), which includes the terminal handling charge. For transport from the
factory to the port, the range is from US$450-US$1000. Most ﬁrms give 5-7 days advance notice when arranging
truck transport to the port.

The garments produced have an average value of US$3-US$4 per unit. The higher cost items have more trim
and embroidery. The value per FEU varies from US$100,000 to over US$200,000. The garments are shipped
FOB or Free Carrier (FCA) with payment by TT, usually 7-30 days after loading on the vessel. International
freight rates vary by destination but are currently about US$800 per FEU for East Asia, US$1,800 for North
Europe and US$3,600 for the US east coast.

The major challenge for the factories is to retain skilled labor and securing adequate energy supplies. Logistics
is not considered a major problem; although the high cost for land transport and difﬁculties with submission
of various shipping documents and with clearing the cargoes are among the concerns mentioned by factory
managers.

Although Customs has improved its performance considerably, it is still seen as inefﬁcient in processing
imported inputs. Customs declarations can be submitted electronically for imports but hardcopies must be
submitted together with supporting documents. A Report of Finding from the PSI is required for imports worth
more than US$4,000. Clearance is often delayed because customs ofﬁcials are unavailable for processing. An
import license may be required for speciﬁc commodities. The application for import permits should take only
one day but, in practice, can require three to four days. Finally, the level of inspection remains high (Table 4).

For exports, the major source of delay is associated with the issue of the certiﬁcate of origin (CO), which can
only be issued after shipment and can require 5-10 days. This delays the transfer of documents to the buyer and
payments to the exporter. The cost for reapplying for a CO is also high, about US$280.

 3.4 International competitiveness of Cambodia’s garment industry
 The contraction of the global trade in apparel during the ﬁnancial crisis produced downward pressure on the
 prices paid to the manufacturers. The buyers not only reduced their orders but also placed greater emphasis
 on reducing order cycles and increasing ﬂexibility in production and delivery. They also changed the terms
 of payment, thereby extending the manufacturers’ cash-to-cash cycle. It is unclear to what extent the
 manufacturers will be able to reverse these developments even when the global economy recovers. The impact
 on Cambodia has been limited because it produces basic apparel, with little fashion content and a long shelf
 life. However, these developments create an obstacle for manufacturers to move into higher-value products.

 The recent upward pressure on wages for Cambodian workers is creating a problem for Cambodia’s garment
 manufacturers, who compete primarily on price.13 There is greater competition from China, which has reasserted
 itself in the low end of the market. Also, opportunities for reducing the order cycle are limited since about 70
 percent of the order cycle is taken up by delivery of inputs and international shipping of exports (see details
 on supply chain competitiveness in the section above and in the conclusions and recommendations presented
 at the end of the chapter). Another difﬁculty facing the manufacturers is the trend among larger buyers to
 limit the number of suppliers and contract with OEMs that can manage the inbound supply chains. In terms of
 markets, there is an on-going redistribution of demand with much of the growth coming not from the EU and
 US but from the larger emerging economies.

 The need for more working capital to accommodate these changes has not been a signiﬁcant problem because
 most of the factories rely on their foreign owners to provide the funds. For Cambodian manufacturers to provide
 more value-addition, however, access to credit for garment factories that have been incorporated locally or that
 wish to evolve to become ODMs may need to be facilitated. For the same reason there is less concern about
 foreign exchange risk (in addition to the fact that there are few restrictions on foreign currency transactions
 in Cambodia), but the process of de-dollarization of Cambodia’s economy may pose risks in the medium-to-
 long term.


 3.5 General objective and strategies
 The export of garments has grown steadily with the exception of the recent downturn due to the global ﬁnancial
 crisis and it remains the principal export of Cambodia. However its share of total exports has declined as shown
 in Figure 4 and now amounts to about 55 percent. The objective for the industry is to sustain growth in the value
 of exports and thereby its contribution to economic growth.

 The strategy for accomplishing this objective must have separate components for vendor factories and contract
 manufacturers. For vendor factories, logistics need to be improved to reduce time and cost for the inbound and
 outbound supply chains and to address shortages of labor and power. It is also important to facilitate approval
 for foreign investments that will produce higher value garments and open new markets while also providing
 access to credit for local manufacturers. For contract manufactures, the improvements in logistics should be
 complemented with improvements in the supply chains. There is also need for technical and ﬁnancial support
 for the transition from CMT/Assembly operations to OEMs and compete effectively with vendor factories.

 3.6 Implementation
 While the private sector has been effective in organizing production of garments and expanding the volume of
 exports, there is a lack of strategic vision. Most of the management decisions are made outside of the country
 with the result that the industry lacks a consensus on the need for diversifying its products and markets,

 13
      Given the large portion of the non-farm, non-government labor that is employed in the sector, the difficulty in recruiting and retaining workers, and the growing
      assertiveness of labor unions, it is expected that this will continue.

increasing the quality of its products and/or adding value within Cambodia. First priority should be given to
developing a vision on how to achieve the growth objectives mentioned above. This requires a coordinated effort
involving the government and private sector. It also requires an assessment of the market opportunities

There are a variety of markets for higher value garments that Cambodia might consider, some of which are
shown in Table 5. Each has slightly different requirement in terms of supply chain performance. While individual
ﬁrms will continue to choose their markets, there is an advantage to selecting a target market for the garment
industry, especially for the contract manufacturers. This would allow for a coordinated effort in developing the
logistics and other capabilities that will provide a competitive advantage for that target market.

Most of the markets will require a reduction in the order cycle times. Current cycle times vary. The time for
ordering fabric varies between 3 and 8 weeks depending on availability. The production runs are typically 4
weeks but depends on the size of the order. The time for delivery ranges from 2 to 5 weeks depending on the
destination. The result is a total order cycle of 2 ½ to 4 months. A movement into high value products implies
an increase in the order time for higher quality fabric. Any reduction in order sizes would have relatively little
impact on production time because of the ﬁxed time for setting up a new production line. The delivery time is
determined by destination, which may change with the diversiﬁcation into new markets.

Efforts to reduce the order cycle to 2 to 3 months would require a tightening of the inbound supply chain,
primarily though improvements in the trade corridor linking Phnom Penh with the international container
terminals near Ho Chi Minh. This would include both the road linkage via Bavet and container barge connection
from Phnom Penh port. Current efforts to ﬁnalize the transit agreement with Vietnam and to introduce
simpliﬁed procedures for the movement of goods in transit should ensure reliable connections to scheduled
container shipping services.

This trade corridor provides a shorter transit time than the current route through Sihanoukville due to the
combination of a larger number of scheduled services and more direct connections. Initially the savings will be
relatively small because the new container terminals have yet to attract the anticipated trafﬁc. The shipping
lines have been cautious about expanding services following the global ﬁnancial crisis. While these ports
already offer better connectivity, it is anticipated that the time savings will increase over the next ﬁve years. For
Asian trade the savings in the transit time to Asian sources of fabric and to customers in Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan should be 1 to 2 weeks while for the European trade it would be 2 to 3 weeks.

Additional savings in transit time can be achieved through improvements in trade facilitation are needed to
reduce the clearance ties for both the imported fabrics and the exported garments. These would build on the
current Customs Reform and Modernization program but target the border crossing at Bavet and the Phnom

 window for processing documents, there needs to be greater use of risk management to reduce the amount of
 physical inspections, expedited testing procedures, less direct interaction between shippers and regulators and
 better control on hours of operations.

 Another opportunity for reducing the order cycle is improving the management of the inbound supply chains.
 This applies primarily to contract manufacturers since the vendor factories already have tight control over their
 supply of inputs. A reduction in the time for procurement of textiles can be achieved through various initiatives
 which can provide savings of 1 to 2 weeks in delivery times for fabrics:

               participation in the selection of fabrics,
               collective ordering in order to negotiate a higher priority in the production schedule,
               domestic facilities for dyeing and ﬁnishing fabric, 14
                sourcing arrangements with smaller factories, and
               rapid delivery for the initial delivery

     There have been proposals for development of upstream production of fabrics, but this is not feasible in the
     short-to-medium term because these activities require greater skills and are more capital and energy intensive
     than garment manufacturing. Equally important, Cambodia does not produce the raw materials required
     unlike many of its competitors.

     In order to create an environment that is attractive to foreign investors, Cambodia needs to develop garment
     clusters that can accommodate bonded factories, offer reliable utilities and logistics services, provide access
     to a large labor pool and attract supporting industries. An extensive network of special economic zones exists,
     but only three have had any success and these have a random collection of enterprises. Currently, most
     garment manufacturers prefer to operate outside of the zone near Phnom Penh or in Kandal Province
     because they have the same ability to import fabric under temporary admission and set up bonded storage
     but without restrictions on location or the activities they can pursue. To be successful, any new clusters
     should be designed jointly by the government and GMAC and offer the same advantage.

     The relatively high borrowing costs in Cambodia do not affect vendor factories which have access to ﬁnance
     raised on international markets by their parent company. However, they prevent the transformation of local
     contract manufacturers from CMT/Assembly to OEMs and ODMs. These manufacturers rely on retained
     earnings for working capital and limit their investments in new equipment. However, if they are to improve
     their control over the supply chains and produce higher value goods with more costly inputs, then it is
     necessary to create ﬁnancial instruments speciﬁcally for this sector.

 Even with development of clusters and better access to capital, the contract manufacturers need to develop
 knowledge-based competencies in the areas of sourcing fabrics, supply chain management, lean retailing,
 managing ﬁnancial risk and human resource development. It is difﬁcult for individual ﬁrms to ﬁnance training
 in these areas but it would be possible with support from the government and the GMAC. The same applies
 to the training skilled operators where the risk for individual ﬁrms is that the trained operators will be poached
 by other companies. Currently, there are two major training institutes serving the apparel industry.15 However,
 the training activity needs to be expanded in both scope and scale, which will require support from the RGC.




 14
       Equipment for dyeing and finishing would enable firms to maintain stocks of the more commonly used grades of fabric in greige form. This would reduce lead
       times and increase flexibility but primarily benefit ODM manufacturers. OEM manufacturers would have to convince buyers that they could meet their
       specifications and create an additional round of sample approvals.

       Cambodia Garment Training Center (CGTC) is funded by Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and run by GMAC and offers training in basic sewing skills;
       Cambodia Skills Development Center (CASDEC)), which is largely financially self-sufficient; offers training in technical and industrial engineering, especially
       targeting middle management offering assistance for production management, including workflow, planning, controls, and supervision.

Recommendations
     RGC should encourage contract manufacturers in particular to engage in collective ordering of inputs
     in order to beneﬁt from economies of scale and reduce costs;

     Garment manufacturers should be incentivized to move up the value chain from production of basic
     apparel which is increasingly crowded to producing niche higher-value items;

     Improve the performance of the trade corridors to ports in Vietnam. The Vietnamese ports
     (Ho Chi Minh, Cai Mep) have more frequent vessels calls with direct shipping which would signiﬁcantly
     reduce sailing times and therefore order cycle times;

     The government and private sector should develop garment clusters in order to attract more FDI.
     The clusters should offer reliable utilities and logistics services and help also to provided access to a
     large pool of labor, credit and attract support services; and

     RGC should streamline and expedite the issuance of certiﬁcates of origin. Current practices take too
     much time while the cost for renewals is high.

4.1 Trade
Over the past decade, global exports of footwear were increasing steadily until 2009, when there was
a contraction due to the ﬁnancial. Overall, the value doubled in the eight year period ending in 2010 and this
trend is expected to continue. During the same period, the value of Cambodian footwear exports tripled
(Figure 9). However, its share of global markets remains well below 1 percent (Figure 10). The increase in
value was due to an increase in volume but more importantly to an increase in the unit value, which doubled
during this period. While footwear remains the second largest exporter product, its value is only about
6 percent that of garment exports.

Almost 60 percent of the Cambodian footwear is sold to the EU, primarily to the United Kingdom and Germany.
Other signiﬁcant markets are Asia with around 20 percent, most of which is destined for Japan, and North
America with around 10 percent, most of which goes to the United States (Figure 11).

Buyers and distributors
Vendor factories sell their products to brand manufacturers, wholesalers and retail chains. The contract
manufacturers sell primarily to wholesalers and buying agents. The larger factories market their services
directly, while smaller manufactures often rely on the Footwear Order Center Cambodia (FOCC)16 to identifying
buyers and, in some cases, to manage product quality. Footwear exports are usually shipped on FOB/FCA
terms with the factory responsible for delivering the goods to the loading port or the warehouse of the buyer’s
nominated forwarder.

Span of control
The vendor factory has minimal control over its inbound and outbound supply chains. The headquarters
manages everything from sourcing of inputs and managing contacts with buyers to product design, marketing,
and ﬁnance. The factory arranges the logistics for movement between the factory gate and the forwarder’s
warehouse or loading port. Interactions between factory and buyers are normally limited to an exchange of
samples. As a result, the factory has limited opportunities to increase the value of its ﬁnished goods. It will be
allocated the production of higher value goods once it has demonstrated its capability in terms of productivity
and quality control.

Contract manufacturers have a greater control over their supply chains. They are involved in not only sourcing
inputs but also developing basic designs, obtaining trade ﬁnance, and arranging the local logistics. However, the
marketing and branding of the products is done by the buyers so the manufacturers have no direct interaction
with the ﬁnal market or consumers.

Concentration
About six of the shoe factories in Cambodia are large vendor factories that employ on average about 6,000
workers. They have a relatively high productivity, about 750 pairs per worker, due to investment in modern
equipment and are estimated to account for about half of the total domestic production of 50 million pairs per
year. The remaining factories are smaller, employing an average of 1,500 employees. These are estimated to
produce between 2,000 and 3,000 pairs per day or about 500 pairs per employee per year.

4.3 Supply chain performance
All of the factories surveyed were vendor factories. Their supply chains are relatively simple. There are few
intermediaries other than the foreign owners and forwarders nominated by the buyers, as shown in Figure
15. The leather and fabric used for production is imported primarily from China, Taiwan and South Korea.
The factories purchase leather direct from tanneries though they frequently have problems with the quality.
Fabric is ordered from suppliers nominated by the buyers. The suppliers usually arrange the shipments.
These are on an FOB basis with weekly shipments in containers. The average time for delivery of the inputs is
30-45 days.

Payment is made at the time of delivery or 15-40 days thereafter. The cost of delivering the container from
the port to the factory is US$400-US$700 for a 20-foot container and US$600-$1,000 for a 40-foot container.
A similar cost is incurred for the movement of the footwear from the factory to the loading ports/airport.

Most inputs are imported duty-free with a value per container ranging from US$15,000 to US$55,000. The
trade documents that present the greatest problem are import permits and technical certiﬁcates which
normally require 3-5 days to obtain instead of one day.

The headquarters arranges the shipment of exports, which are shipped on a weekly basis. The principal
destinations are Japan and the EU. Nearly all the exports are shipped by sea in containers that are loaded at the

Any strategy for achieving growth must differentiate between vendor factories and contract manufacturers
since the activities of the former are controlled off shore whereas the latter is more responsive to local
market conditions. With the current structure of the industry, overseas managers make the decisions
regarding markets and product value for half of the exports. For the other half, decisions are made locally but
the factories are smaller and have limited capacity to move up the value chain. The strategy for the vendor
factories would focus on creating an attractive environment for FDI. In the short run, the challenge will be
to improve productivity and quality of output of the factories so that their owners will allocate to them to
produce higher value products. In the medium term, the challenge is to create an environment that will attract
companies that produce higher value footwear. The strategy for the contract manufacturers would focus on
incentives for increasing the span of control of contract manufacturers. This would include greater involvement
in sourcing inputs and marketing their production capacity to buyers interested in small to medium orders of
high value footwear.

4.6 Implementation
Speciﬁc activities to support this parallel strategy might include:

      developing enclaves to encourage both foreign investment in factories and domestic production of inputs
      improving training for both management and semi-skilled labor and
      increasing the availability of ﬁnance to support the growth and evolution of the contract manufacturers

The enclaves would be in the form of special purpose zones. One would be for of leather processing and include
the necessary water treatment facilities and other environmental safeguards. This would be used to expand
tannery capacity and develop leather dyeing and ﬁnishing activities in order to increase the supply and improve
the quality of local leather. This would produce a signiﬁcant increase in value addition since leather accounts
for a signiﬁcant port of the cost of footwear with leather uppers. Since there would continue to be signiﬁcant
competition from low-cost suppliers in China and Vietnam suppliers, this enclave would focus on the providing
a reliable supply of higher value leather.

Another enclave would support a cluster for shoe factories, suppliers of inputs and providers of services. It
would encourage local production of inputs including lasts, soles, lining, packaging, provide bonded storage
for generic inputs and create opportunities for joint procurement of inputs and logistics services. The access
to local inputs and services would be of immediate beneﬁt to the contract manufacturers. Over time, it is
expected that the vendor factories would also increase local procurement.

These enclaves would allow for a reduction in order cycles. At present, the typical order cycle up to the point
of export is 1.5 - 3 months with imported inputs accounting for about half of this cycle. By introducing local
production and bonded storage for generic inputs, the order cycle could be reduced by 2-4 weeks.

The challenge in developing both enclaves is to provide sufﬁcient value for potential locators. In order to do
this, there would have to be substantial private sector involvement in both the planning and management
of these enclaves.

Activities related to training require collaboration between the industry and government to provide training
in areas that individual companies lack the capacity or resources to provide. The selection of the curriculum
would be done jointly; the private sector would take the lead in recruitment of instructors; and the government
would provide support for the operation of a common training facility. The assignment of responsibility for
speciﬁc areas would be assigned based on interest, for example:

      a private sector effort to provide management training in lean manufacturing and quality control,
      a public sector effort to train managers in the evolving physical, social and environment standards




                                                                      Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                                An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   35
       of importing countries, and
       a public-private effort to teach new workers the skills of shoe making.

 The target audience for the training would be the contract manufacturers since the vendor factories already
 have their own training programs. However, if the training is successful it is expected that the vendor factories
 would also make use of it in training their employees.

 Improvements in trade ﬁnance are required so that the contract manufacturers can expand their activity
 and extend the involvement in the inbound supply chain to include procurement of inputs and participation
 in the design process. These changes require an increase the working capital requirements and extend
 the cash-to-cash cycle. The goal is to provide ﬁnancing on terms comparable to that available to competing
 ﬁrms, in this case the vendor factories. This would require a joint effort by government and the commercial
 banks to reduce the risk premiums associated with lending to this sector. The expected increase in cash-to-
 cash cycle would still be within tenor currently on offer.

 In addition to these activities, the development of an efﬁcient corridor connecting to the new container terminals
 downriver from Ho Chi Minh Port would reduce the order cycle and lower freight rates for both imported inputs
 and exported products.

 Recommendations
       The foot wear sector in Cambodia has great potential for growth but RGC should encourage
       the increased use of locally sourced inputs as well as greater value addition in Cambodia;

       Government and the private sector should cooperate to develop footwear industry clusters to increase
       volume, have access to a larger pool of labor and obtain the beneﬁts from economies of scale from
       co-location;

       Develop the trade and transport corridor to Cai Mep in Vietnam, which has higher frequency of vessel
       calls to key source markets for inputs and markets for exports.

       Increase the availability of ﬁnance for contract manufacturers in particular, so they can increase quality
       and capacity.

 5.1 Trade and production
 Cambodia is located between the largest exporter of silk yarn, China, and one of the largest exporters of
 traditional silk, Thailand. Its role in the global silk trade is therefore overshadowed by the larger suppliers in
 the region. The Khmer silk sector generates signiﬁcant employment for households in rural areas, however.

      Accurate information is not available on these flows because much of the yarn is smuggled in from Vietnam, exports of silk fabric and garments move through
      a variety of outlets including local retail and small shipments, and the production of silk fabric for domestic consumption is not reported.

However, it could become a problem if there were growth in sales to foreign retailers. Formality of production
will, therefore, be necessary if silk is to be sold to foreign retailers in signiﬁcant quantities.

5.2 Potential growth in production
The outlook for growth in production differs for the production of yarn and ﬁnished goods. In the last few years,
there has been a marginal increase in the number of breeders. The competition from other crops that produce
higher yields however, and the time and effort required to manage the larvae are expected to discourage
signiﬁcant increases over the current level of production. More importantly, the farmers cannot compete in
terms of cost with the Chinese producers of cocoons from bivoltine silkworms.19 The only area where the
farmers are competitive is the production of cocoons from polyvoltine hybrids of the traditional Golden silk
(Bombyx mori). This must be done locally primarily at the village level production since the yarn must be
hand-reeled.

There is more potential for growth in the production of silk fabrics using imported yarn since weaving does not
compete directly with other agricultural activities and yields higher returns than the production of cocoons.
Domestic demand for fabric is expected to increase as the population increases and disposable incomes
rise.20 Assuming a continued preference for locally woven fabric, domestic producers will be able to compete
with Chinese manufacturers even without access to large-scale silk production using power looms such as
exists in Chinese factories. Cambodia will also be able to compete in the export market since Cambodia’s silk
exports are marketed as handicrafts and thus require the use of handlooms.

The growth in exports depends on the ability to identify new markets and improve both the quality and availability
of ﬁnished products. Currently, the larger silk producers are constrained by demand while the smaller ones are
constrained in terms of cost and availability of high quality yarn. Until these constraints are overcome, the
sector will fail to attract the attention of business and commercial banks. The decentralized nature and size of
the industry also represents a constraint on higher investment.

5.3 Supply chains
The silk supply chain includes a number of productive activities such as sericulture, processing, external sourcing
and marketing (Table 6). The ﬁrst three are conducted at the village level either by individuals or cooperatives.
These are concentrated in the northwest of Cambodia, where local yarn is weaved and incorporated in the ﬁnal
product. In the southeast, imported yarn predominates the weaving process.

Efforts by the government to promote the silk industry have focused on local production but lefts the marketing
aspects to agents. In contrast, the larger private companies integrate production and marketing.

The ﬁnished products that are exported include plain silk fabric, scarves, handbags and cushions. The most
common destinations are the US, EU (mainly France, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland), Singapore, and Australia.
Distribution channels include local retail, internet sales and exports to individual retailers. The domestic retail
is a mix of higher value goods sold through hotels and local boutiques and lower value goods produced for the
domestic market but purchased by tourists. Internet sales are business-2- consumer (B2C) with products sent
directly to the consumer.

The various markets for Cambodian silk products are summarized in Table 7.

5.4 Business models
The business models used in Cambodia can be differentiated by their sourcing of silk yarn and by the extent of
integration of their supply chains. The ﬁrst model is the village weaver that produces fabric exclusively from
local yarn. The second is the handicraft manufacturer that produces ﬁnished products using fabric produced
in the village from a mix of local and imported yarn. The third model is the commercial manufacturer that
produces ﬁnished products from fabric produced by weaving factories that use imported yarn but may also
incorporate yarn from village manufacturers.

Organizing principal
The manufacturers of the ﬁnished products organize the outbound supply chains. For products made from
local yarn, cooperatives or NGOs purchase yarn from local weavers, produce small volumes of handicrafts and
sell these direct to retailers and ﬁnal customers for sale. In the traditional arrangement, traders would have
performed this function but they are not able to provide the scale or management skills (quality control and
designs) required to produce goods for export. For products made from imported yarn, the ﬁrms manage the
manufacturing and sale of garments, accessories or household furnishings.




                                                                          Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:

 Span of control
 The span of control of the organizing principal varies. Village level organizations are more likely to
 involve themselves in controlling the quality and quantity of inputs provided by the breeders, reelers, and
 dyers. The larger commercial manufacturers buy their imported inputs through local wholesalers and
 their domestic inputs through local traders. The organizing principal has more control over the outbound
 supply chain since most of the sales are made directly to local retailers or to foreign customer via direct
 distribution channels such as the Internet.

 5.5 Supply chain performance
 The producers surveyed produce silk garments from a combination of local or imported yarn and dyes. The
 ﬁnished goods are sold through local outlets and also shipped directly to Europe, North America and East Asia.

 Imported yarn costs about US$50 per kilogram. It is purchased from local wholesalers who deliver the yarn
 within a few days and are paid in cash. Locally produced yarn is purchased directly from the producers.
 The delivery time, which includes dyeing the yarn, is up to 15 days. Payment is on a cash basis paid at time
 of delivery.

 For exports, the ﬁrms use a mix of sea and air shipments, the duration of transit and associated costs
 vary according to the method of delivery. Some ﬁrms ship by sea as Less than Container Load (LCL)
 cargo and by airfreight (60-70 percent by ocean, 30-40 percent by air). Others rely on courier services
 (e.g. DHL, UPS, TNT). The order cycle from conﬁrmation of order to delivery to the destination port/
 airport is as little as 1-2 weeks for air shipments and as much as 3 months for shipments by sea.
 Typical shipments are relatively small with about 100-700 pieces with anaverage value of the US$2,000-
 US$10,000, but orders can be as small as US$400 and as large as US$30,000.

 Payments for exported silk products vary according to the sales channel. Exports are sold on an FOB
 basis to wholesalers and retailers but on a CFR basis through Internet sales. For FOB shipments,
 a 30-50 percent advance is paid at the time of order conﬁrmation and the rest is paid at the time of
 shipment or one week thereafter. For CFR shipments, payment is made at the time the order is conﬁrmed
 or when the goods are shipped. As a result the cash-to-cash cycle is only about 2 weeks. The producers rely
 on their own funds for working capital.

 5.6 Objectives and strategies
 The government’s main objective for the silk sector may be to increase employment for the rural poor and
 older family members. The silk industry represents a very small share of the country’s economic
 activity and trade, and currently lacks the inputs, scale and organization to be a major contributor to the
 domestic economy or Cambodia’s export mix. However, as a small-scale, village-based activity, it
 provides a signiﬁcant level of rural employment especially for women or the inﬁrm. An appropriate
 strategy for increasing the volume of production at the village level may therefore be welfare-enhancing for
 local communities.

 The RGC’s policy options for expanding this industry may be most easily targeted at introducing modern
 management of productive technology, perhaps through the introduction of cooperatives in each province
 that can form a management structure and provide a framework through which to target reforms in
 the industry. The production of silk products for export continues to be a handicraft industry based on
 village- level craftsmen, which hampers the aggregation of the sector into more efﬁcient economies
 of scale. While production can expand or contract to meet demand, it is not possible to introduce modern
 management or production technology within the limits of the current industry structure. Handlooms
 allow the industry to ﬁll small orders with short delivery schedules but the outdated equipment
 makes it difﬁcult to control costs and quality. If the industry is to grow but continue to generate rural
 employment, then a new mechanism must be developed for organizing this activity.

      Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
42    An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Cambodia faces signiﬁcant competition from China for manufactured silk products and from Thailand in
traditional hand-woven products. This competition extends to Cambodia’s domestic market. Since Cambodia
lacks the scale to compete, it must currently focus on niche markets. The current mix of ﬁnal products—
primarily scarves, simple accessories and home furnishings—offer little in the way of style. Instead, they are
marketed based on the quality of the fabric and the cachet of being produced in Cambodia using traditional
means. The high-end products use “Golden Khmer silk yarn” but the supply relies on small weaving operations
creating problems with the reliability and consistency of the yarn.

A diversiﬁed set of distribution channels is used including local sales to tourists, internet sales and supply
contracts with boutique outlets. Any further diversiﬁcation would require a signiﬁcant increase in scale. In
order to grow the Cambodian silk industry in the long run, it will necessary to develop new products
supported by new distribution channels. These need to be high-value products since Cambodia cannot
compete on cost or scale. One possibility is to refocus on the production of fabric and expand village level
production and emphasize color and quality through the formation of cooperatives and solid training for
local people toward quality and efﬁciency.

5.7 Implementation
Efforts to expand production and develop new distribution channels will require cooperation between
the public and private sector. In order to make the transition from manufacturing handicrafts to
supplying fashion accessories, it will be necessary to increase scale of production. This can be achieved
through consolidation of production based on cooperatives, mergers, or marketing arrangements. Because
of the signiﬁcant level of involvement of NGOs in exporting silk products, this effort would require
collaboration from government and the private sector.

The consolidation of production would be complemented by adjustments to the inbound and outbound
supply chains. By increasing the size of orders for yarn, dyes and other inputs, the industry can develop a
direct relationship with suppliers and customize their orders. By consolidating the distribution of their
products, they can accept larger orders and reduce distribution costs. Individual producers can develop joint
marketing effort with individual brands treated as separate product lines. There are also opportunities for
reducing costs within the supply chain especially through tighter integration of the inbound supply chains
and consolidation of shipments on the outbound supply chains.

The main focus should be on increasing the value of the fabric itself, however. Since silk fabric is a
standard product, this requires differentiation in the quality of weaving, dyeing and product design. One
option is to open a second line of business that focuses on producing higher quality fabric. This would
be sold to high-end producers of fashion accessories and household furni-shings. This would take advantage
of the ﬂexibility of the village based system but introduce improved quality control. It would transfer
responsibility for design and marketing to those more familiar with the market (but not preclude
manufacture of ﬁnished products or the development of in-house designs). An example of this
 strategy is presented in the box below.



  A useful example of this was the pioneering efforts of the Jim Thompson Thai silk company
  which was formed shortly after World War II to revive the Thai silk industry. It expanded its
  business by building a relationship with the cottage industry in the village of Ban Krua and
  encouraged them to use better looms and dyes. Because of its texture, the silk was more suited
  to home furnishings and Thompson emphasized the bright colors and integrating the fabric
  into contemporary design. He provided access to overseas markets through contacts with
  high-end retailers in the US and through retail outlets in Bangkok. Over the decades the company
  has evolved its product line from fabrics to garments and accessories and home furnishings and
  now collaborates with international designers in furniture design.



                                                                    Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                              An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   43
     The company currently operates factories where weaving, printing, design and tailoring are
     performed. It promotes sericulture by raising and selling bivoltine silkworms in the factory
     and working continues to work with village breeders under a subcontracting system.



 The government can develop a more efﬁcient connection between Vietnamese suppliers of yarn and
 domestic buyers by simplifying border-crossing procedures. This would encourage the buyers to formalize
 their imports and, in the process, cut out various intermediaries. The weaving factories could import yarn
 directly from producers and establish a relationship to ensure consistency and quality of the yarn.

 The government can work with the private sector to encourage a joint purchasing effort. It can support
 marketing of the industry to complement private sector efforts to market their product lines. Finally it can
 coordinate with the private sector to develop and enforce standards for a Cambodian Silk Quality Assurance
 Label and to provide training to factories on Standards, Metrology, Testing, and Quality (SMTQ).

 Recommendations
        RGC can implement policies to encourage the formation of coope-ratives in order to increase the
        scale of production and rationalize the supply of yarn

        Encourage the production of higher quality fabric through cooperatives or marketing associations
        (still using the village-based approach emulating the Jim Thompson model.)

        Use the cooperative structure tomake formal business relationships with Vietnamese suppliers in
        order to establish a regular supply chain and bargain for better input prices.

        RGC can initiate a joint purchasing effort on behalf of the cooperatives or marketing associations

        RGC can work with appropriate agencies (such as the Institute of Standards Cambodia) to develop
        and enforce relevant standards to promote exports.

 6.1 Trade ﬁnance
 The majority of demand for trade ﬁnance is to provide working capital to increase the size orders that exporters
 can accept. This is especially important for exports of agriculture products such as rice, rubber, cassava, maize,
 and cashew nuts. Trade ﬁnance has been less important for imports of inputs to the production of exported
 products. Instead the focus has been on orders for petroleum products, construction materials, car, agricultural
 equipment, pharmaceutical products, and fast moving consumption goods.

 The annual value of the various forms of trade ﬁnance is estimated to be in excess of US$100 million, which is
 a relatively small percentage of the banks’ total portfolio. Import ﬁnancing is primarily in the form of L/C with
 more than US$200 million issued per year.

 Available instruments
 The major banks vary in the trade ﬁnance products they offer. Some focus on L/C but others provide a broader
 range of services including guarantees (advance, payment, retention, shipping) and documentary collections.
 Most banks offer discounting and pre-shipment ﬁnancing for exports. Domestic L/C are for exports that require
 domestic inputs are available, but there is little demand to date. A few banks offer trust receipts for import
 transactions.

 L/C for imports are issued in amounts up to several million US dollars for periods of 1-3 months although
 longer periods can be arranged. The fee charged for L/C varies from 0.10-0.15 percent per month plus an
 issuing fee. The collateral required may be as much as 100 percent of face value. The terms of the L/C do not
 require that the bill of lading be issued in the name of the issuing bank but this is preferred.

 The most common method of payment for both imports and exports is TT followed by a sight draft. Time drafts
 are less common.

 Loans
 Commercial banks offer loans for working capital in the form of overdrafts with a deﬁned credit line. The
 maximum tenor is 180 days to one year. The loans are backed by collateral and the balance sheet. Where
 there is a clean ﬁnancial statement and other indicators of ﬁnancial soundness, loans may be issued without
 collateral. Banks prefer lending to exporters for speciﬁc contracts rather than for general working capital.

 For exports arranged through L/C, banks will discount the face value of the L/C up to 70-80 percent. However,
 50-60 percent is more common. The annual interest rate is about 12 percent and processing fees are relatively
 small although in some cases additional collateral is required. Some banks only provide post-shipment
 discounting.

 The interest rate in Cambodia is high compared with the interest rates in Hong Kong or Singapore. Therefore
 Cambodian traders often use offshore ﬁnance arranged through their foreign buyers/traders. Foreign owned
 ﬁrms arrange offshore ﬁnance through their parent companies. This is particularly common in the garment
 industry. Other sources of trade ﬁnance, e.g. credit from foreign suppliers and buyers, or supply chain
 intermediaries, are not signiﬁcant.

 It is unclear to what extent high interest rates and collateral requirements depress demand for trade ﬁnance,
 but the expectation is that the volume of trade ﬁnance will grow and a broader range of services will be offered
 in the future. Possible changes in trade ﬁnance as a result of new regulations might include international rules
 on the issue of L/C and the establishment of a credit bureau for sharing credit information.

Foreign exchange
The exchange rate regime in Cambodia includes ofﬁcial and parallel exchange rates. The ofﬁcial rate is
determined by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) for transactions between the NBC, government and the
public sector. The parallel rate is a freely ﬂoating rate used for all the private sector transactions.

All exporters and importers of goods and services need to make payments for their commercial transactions
through banks permanently established (domiciled) in the Kingdom of Cambodia. For exports, the proceeds
need to be credited to the exporters account with the domiciled bank.

The only restrictions on foreign exchange operations such as purchases and sales on foreign exchange
markets, all types of international settlements, and capital ﬂows in foreign or domestic currency is that these
operations be undertaken through domiciled banks. As a result, banks are able to offer foreign exchange
transactions including spot, swap, forwards and options, however, so far demand has been limited.

Clearing and forwarding services
The logistics industry in Cambodia is relatively large given the size of the country. The Cambodian Freight
Forwarding Association, CAMFFA, has more than 200 members and is a well-organized union. The industry is
composed of many small ﬁrms, fewer medium sized ﬁrms and some large, international players. Most of the
medium-sized companies are part of international forwarding companies or networks.

For clearing and forwarding (C&F) agents, imports make up the largest share of their business, reﬂecting
the trade imbalance of the country. Nevertheless, C&F companies also handle exports, mainly rice and
garments, as well as some admissions.

The C&F ﬁrms provide both domestic and international forwarding and may act as NVOCCs (non-vessel
operating common carriers). Almost all offer transport, consolidation, storage, packaging and labeling.
The larger ﬁrms provide inventory management and bonded storage. The more sophisticated companies,
mainly large international operators, perform assembly and customization, manage cold chains and provide
testing and quality controls.

The large, international forwarders compete primarily on quality of service. They operate in a different market
segment from the smaller service providers, which offer basic services and compete on price. The foreign
forwarders serve predominantly foreign suppliers, wholesalers/distributors and retailers. They serve a range
of clients including small and large volume shippers.

The foreign buyers have the dominant role in structuring export supply chains for FOB shipments. The
international forwarders often have service contracts with their larger clients giving them authority to
manage all logistics. Among the interviewed ﬁrms, all freight forwarders provide door-to-door service.
The dominant destinations are North America and Europe, followed by East Asia.

Major clients are producers of consumer goods (~60 percent) as well as ﬁrms from the construction sector
(~15 percent). Construction material is in most cases project cargo. Most of the contracts are for speciﬁc time-
periods with a ﬁxed unit price for shipping.

For outbound shipments, the forwarders issue bills of lading, combined bills of lading and multimodal transport
document. Some of the documents conform to the standard International Federation of Freight Forwarders
Associations (FIATA) format. The C&F ﬁrms use computer systems for all kinds of business operations,
including coordination of transport services, processing cargo/shipping information, coordination with the
consignees and communicating with banks.

All interviewed ﬁrms mentioned licenses and regulations as key impediments to expanding their services.
There were also problems with the reliability of trucking services as well as restrictions on what services they
are allowed to provide.



                                                                     Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                               An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   47
 Clearing
 The larger ﬁrms are more involved in clearing manufactured goods while the smaller ﬁrms cleared mostly
 agricultural products. Large ﬁrms clear between 200-300 shipments per months while smaller ﬁrms clear as
 little as one shipment a week.

 The information for clearing cargo is entered into the system at the customs ofﬁce by the customs ofﬁcer or
 the broker. Delays in the clearing process are caused primarily by missing supporting documents or errors in
 evaluation.

     Imports are cleared either at the point of entry, an Inland Container Depot (ICD) or an inland customs facility.
     The fees charged for clearing cargo vary with some brokers charging by declaration and others by the
     quantity of goods cleared. There are signiﬁcant differences in the fees charged. Large international ﬁrms
     have signiﬁcantly higher fees than their competitors. However, the absolute amount of informal fees seems
     to be the same for all ﬁrms.

     The time to obtain an import license or a certiﬁcate of origin varies depending on the issuing agency, the ﬁrm
     and the commodity (manufactured or agricultural products). For example, a large international forwarder is
     able to obtain these documents within one day for manufactured products, but it can take up to 10 days for
     smaller ﬁrms. For agricultural exports it takes 3.5 days.

     The time to clear exports depends on the gateway. The fastest clearance time is 2-6 hours at the airports. At
     the land borders, cargo is cleared in 2-12 hours. At seaports the time is ½ - 2 days while at ICDs it is ½ - 1day.
     According to the ﬁrms interviewed, it is often not clear what the exact document requirements are or what the
     rates for duties and taxes will be. Further, there is a problem with discretionary behavior of ofﬁcials, informal
     payments and irregular enforcement of laws.

     While computer systems are widely used in the industry, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is rarely used
     for communication with clients or service provider.

 International freight rates
 The freight rates on the international routes ﬂuctuate with global demand. They dropped dramatically in
 2009 as a result of the global ﬁnancial crisis. They have since recovered but are still below the 2008 rates.
 Examples of current rates for typical shipments from Cambodia to typical destinations are shown in Table 8.
 These incorporate the basic discounts but not the deeper discounts available to large foreign importers. The
 rates are also for basic level of service. These will increase for shipping lines offering faster or more reliable
 services and decrease for those offering slower, less reliable services.

6.2 Road transport
While Cambodia has an extensive inland water network and a backbone rail line, road transport is the
dominant mode of freight transport. The railway consist of 640 km of single track meter gauge lines linking
Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville and to a terminus about 50 km from Poipet. The railway is used to transport
to the port but otherwise has a small share in the freight market. A concession to develop the rail system
was signed will Toll Railways in 2009 and should eventually generate a signiﬁcant increase of rail freight
despite the short travel distances. River transport is growing in importance with containers and bulk
cargoes moving by barge from the area around Phnom Penh down the Mekong to Cai Mep and the terminals
near Ho Chi Minh Port. These include schedule feeder services provide by some of the largest international
container shipping lines. The development of new terminals to serve both routes is indicative of the growing
interest in this mode. The trucking sector has been growing with the increasing trade in recent years and
is expected to continue its growth path.

It is estimated that about 340,000 TEUs entered Cambodia in 2010 of which about 86 percent was transported
on trucks (around 290,000 TEU) and the remainder on inland waterways (Figure 19). The large imbalance
with imports overweighing exports results in a large percentage of empty containers moving outbound, which
increases the cost of transporting the loaded containers.21

Cambodia’s trucking ﬂeet is estimated to include 1,500 heavy trucks. There are ﬁve large trucking companies
with more than 100 trucks and a few more in the range of 60-100 vehicles. The majority of ﬁrms, however, are
small operators with 5-40 trucks. The Cambodian Trucking Association (CAMTA), has 15 members with a total
of 800 large trucks, the majority of which are semi-trailers. The trucking companies do not hire independent
operators to meet peak demands but instead rely on informal networks with other trucking companies
providing additional capacity. During the dry season, demand for transport increases between 30-50 percent.

Almost all trucks in Cambodia are second-hand imports from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the US. The
average age at time of imports is between 5-7 years. The present average age is about 15 years. Most companies


21
     This problem is exacerbated by the problem of matching demands for 20- and 40-foot containers, for containers controlled by different lines and the limited
     time shipping lines allow for boxes to be returned to the port.



                                                                                            Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                                                      An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)                     49
 rely on their own funds to purchase trucks. Because of the age of the trucks most of the operating costs are
 for labor, fuel consumption and maintenance accounting together for around 80 percent of all operating costs.
 While this allows the local trucks to compete effectively for short haul movements within Cambodia, it places
 them at a competitive disadvantage for transport goods to the ports in Vietnam and Thailand.

 The principal cargos carried by the larger trucking companies are construction material, other project cargo,
 imports/exports especially for the garment and footwear industry, and bagged rice in containers. Trucks
 typically make only 5-6 lost distance trips per month, giving an annual mileage of less than 40,000km. They
 have a low load factor due to of the lack of return loads. Some ﬁrms have their trucks wait at the destination
 to try and obtain a return load. The return cargo is usually located through agents employed by the company
 in e.g. Sihanoukville.

 It is estimated that between 5-15 percent of trucks are overloaded with some trucks extending the chassis in
 order to carry more. The use of strengthened twenty-foot containers which can carry over 20 tons of imports
 are contributing to this problem. The average percentage of damaged or lost goods is around 3 percent. Most
 of this occurs because of accidents or during cargo handling.

 Competition from foreign truck operators is limited. Thai trucks can cross the border but are restricted to
 operating within 30 km of the border. The number of Vietnamese trucks crossing the border carrying freight to/
 from the Vietnamese ports is increasing but they often must return empty since they cannot carry local cargo.

 The trucking market is divided in two segments. The ﬁrst provide basic movements on a shipment-by- shipment
 basis with competition based on price. This market is dominated by local companies. The second offers a more
 complete service including consolidation warehousing, and clearance with the emphasis on quality of service,
 Recently some large foreign operators, mainly from Japan, have entered this market offering their services
 primarily to foreign companies.

 The larger companies engage in contract haulage with time-based contracts. They use IT systems to manage
 their ﬂeet and are increasing their use of GPS systems. The smaller family-run companies provide haulage
 on a shipment-to-shipment basis with few long-term contracts. They operate on a limited number of routes
 such as Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville. The use of computer systems is very low and the company’s management
 capacity depends solely on the ability of the owner.

 The terms of payment for trucking services varies from payment at the time service is provided to payment
 from 10 days to a maximum of 3 months after the service is provided. Normally, it takes 5 to 30 days to collect
 payments.


 6.3 Clusters and corridors
 Corridors
 The trade corridors serving Cambodia have had a signiﬁcant impact on trade. They have improved access to
 the port at Sihanoukville but also provided access to the more efﬁcient ports in Vietnam thereby reducing
 the time and cost for international shipment. They have fostered regional trade by expediting both formal and
 informal trade with Vietnam and Thailand. The four major trade corridors are:

     1. Western Cambodia-Poipet-Bangkok
     2. Central/Eastern Cambodia-Bavet-H o Chi Minh Port
     3. Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville
     4. Central Cambodia- Mekong-Ho Chi Minh Port to Cai Mep

 The ﬁrst two are land routes. The last two are multimodal and include water routes that use barges
 carrying both containers and general cargo. The ﬁrst three are shown in Figure 19 and the fourth in Figure


      Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
50    An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
20. The physical characteristics of these routes are described in Table 9. For the water routes, the transit
time is 2 to 3 days for Sihanoukville including the time for loading and unloading and 4 to 5 days for Cai
Mep. A typical container barge is shown in Figure 20. It has a capacity of 144 TEU, length of 78 meters and
draft of 4.8 meters.

The most important corridors are those providing connections to the Vietnam deepwater facilities (No’s 2 and 4).
For agricultural goods these provide access to larger general cargo vessels. For containers they provide access
to direct calls by vessels operating on the global corridor to the US and to Europe. Both offer savings in freight
rates because of the larger trafﬁc volumes at the Vietnamese ports. The only constraint is the procedures for
border crossing and movement of goods in transit. Efforts to facilitate trade on these routes are being pursued
at both the regional and bilateral level but more needs to be done to insure uninterrupted movement. The
performance of these corridors is improving as the shipping lines become involved in providing feeder services
to the ports. Additional improvements in performance should be prioritized based on the impact on the cost and
time for movement over the entire length of the corridor.

     Clusters
     Most of Cambodia’s manufacturing is clustered around Phnom Penh while its agricultural production is
     clustered near the borders with Vietnam and Thailand. Although Cambodia has an extensive collection of SEZs
     (Figure 21), there are few industrial clusters that provide economies of scale or support a network of suppliers.
     Only four of the zones have signiﬁcant levels of activity and even these have occupancies of 20 percent or less.
     Also there is little specialization. Two of the zones, Manhattanville Svay Reing and Tia Seng Bavet, have a large
     number of garment factories and one, Sihanoukville, has a signiﬁcant number of factories producing leather
     goods (Table 10). However, all have a random collection of enterprises.

     Manhattanville and Tia Seng are located on the Vietnam border and serve as transfer points for goods moving
     through the port facilities near Ho Chi Minh. However, they do not provide signiﬁcant logistics services. The only
     logistics hub is along the Mekong near Phnom Penh but it is more a collection of cargo-handling facilities than
     a hub offering broad storage, transport and trade facilitation services.




          Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
52        An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
It is likely that there will be some agglomeration of garment and footwear industries as the larger zones increase
in size. It is also expected that the Phnom Penh logistics hub will grow in terms of capacity and variety of services.
Efforts to improve the existing clusters develop additional clusters should focus on increasing competitiveness
by providing efﬁcient connections to the trade routes and encouraging development of domestic suppliers to
serve the factories located with these clusters. This requires better coordination between government and the
private sector in planning the development of the clusters. The development of new zones should be based
on a value proposition that emphasizes efﬁcient logistics rather than taxes and other ﬁnancial incentives.

  Global trade
  The global trade has grown steadily over the last two decades as shown in Figure 1. Of global production, trade
  accounts for only about 7.2 percent. India and China produce about half of total output, but generate only about
  11 percent of total exports. In contrast Vietnam and Thailand account for half of total exports but only 16
  percent of global production. Five countries account for over 4/5 of total exports as shown in Table 1. Of these,
  India’s value per kg is highest since most of its exports are Basmati rice. Thailand has the second highest value
  per kilogram because of its various branded products, including fragrant rice, and the quality of the milling.
  Vietnam has the lowest value since most of its export is generic, white rice.

         Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
56       An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Most of the traded rice is milled and packaged in bags for shipping. As rice is a highly segmented crop, each
market has different prices and consumer preferences. Prices are determined by type, quality (moisture
content, grain length, percentage broken, translucency, etc), consistency of variety and impurities (disease
and foreign matter)22. The basic distinction is between glutinous, aromatic, Japonica, and Indica. The trade
in glutinous rice (sticky rice) is extremely small, about 300,000 tons per year. Indica is the most prevalent
with roughly 23.5 million tons traded annually. The remaining two, aromatic and Japonica, average 5.7 and
1.5 million tons per year, respectively.

The majority of the rice trade is conducted between developing countries. There are two primary channels
for this trade. The ﬁrst is government to government which generally involves large quantities of low value
rice shipped in multiple shipments over a period of time. Although the government negotiates the contract,
it is often left to the private sector or individual state-owned enterprises to procure and mill the rice for export
at an agreed date. The other channel involves contracts between private parties. These are usually arranged by
brokers, international grain traders, or buying associations. International traders take long and short positions
in the commodity market, but also take ownership of the grain and may use back- to-back sales-purchase
agreements to connect the exporter and the importer.

In contrast the brokers act as middleman in the negotiation between the exporter and importer. They assume no
commercial risk and collect only a commission. The associations purchase grain for their members. The largest
is Associated Marketing Service in Europe, which represents Ahold, Dansk, ICA, Migros, and WM Morrison
Supermarkets among others.

Prices
The price of traded rice is determined by availability of supply and demand. Demand increases with population
but varies with the increase in disposable income. On the other hand, a variety of factors affect supply and
because rice is a thinly traded commodity and there is limited substitution between varieties, price volatility can
be quite high (Figure 2). In 2008, the international price peaked due to various factors that led major exporters
to restrict shipments to maintain domestic stockpiles with a reciprocal panic buying by importers.

 Cambodia production and trade
 Cambodia’s rice production consists of mainly three types: (1) fragrant rice grown in the northwest during the
 rainy season; (2) traditional, non-aromatic rice grown during the rainy season in the southeast and (3) IRRI high
 yielding varieties grown during the dry season in the southeast along the Vietnam border. A recent report by
 the World Bank estimates that half of the total harvest is made up from the traditional non-aromatic varieties,
 which include Phkar Khney, Neang Minh, and Neang Khon. About one third to one fourth of the total production
 consists of the IRRI rice. Fragrant rice has signiﬁcantly expanded in recent years, and is about 20 percent of the
 total production.

 The rice growing areas run diagonal from the Northwest to the Southeast of the country along the Tonlé Sap
 and the Mekong River (Figure 3). The fragrant rice is grown in the northwest along the border with Thailand,
 while the IRRI rice is grown in the southeast close to the Vietnam border. Due to the relatively high cost for
 transport, the proximity of modern mills and large-scale trading operations just across the border, a signiﬁcant
 portion of Cambodian padi is transported to Thailand and Vietnam for processing.23

      Other factors contributing to this movement are the lack of domestic milling capacity and shortage of working capital to purchase padi.

The rice sector in Cambodia consists of about 2.9 million rice farms with an average area of less than 2 hectare
and producing approximately 3.0-3.5 tons of padi per year.24 Total production of padi grew at about 8 percent
per year from 2000 to 2010 due both to an increase in the average yield and harvested area. The increase in
yield was achieved through various means including expansion of irrigation infrastructure; increased use of high
yielding varieties; and an intensiﬁcation of the crop cycle allowing double cropping during the main wet season.
Although the average productivity is considerably below the global average, it is comparable with Thailand, the
largest rice exporting country, which has an average yield of 2.88 tons/ha.25

Rice is harvested throughout the year, but about 60 percent of production is harvested during the wet season
(November to January). The majority of wet season rice is planted in traditional varieties. Farmers usually
choose these because they are easier to grow, require fewer imported inputs and meet local tastes. The dry
and early wet season rice is planted using improved varieties because of their higher yields and shorter growing
periods.

Rice for export is collected from June to December (early and medium rice, Table 2). Late rice, ﬂoating rice and
upland rice, all of which are traditional varieties, are consumed domestically.26 Rice is collected from Eastern
Cambodia between December and May and from the Northwest between July and November

The amount of rice exports has increased rapidly in the last few years from 10,000 tons in 2008 to 51,000 tons
in 2010 and 175,000 tons in 2011. In 2010, over 90 percent rice exported shipped to the E.U. and Russia both of
which provide duty-free access. This was due in part to the granting duty free access for Cambodian rice to the
EU in 2009 under the EBA initiative. The principal destination is France with a 55 percent share of Cambodian
rice exports, followed by Poland and Lithuania with another 15 percent. Asia imports less than 4 percent and
North America less than 2 percent.

     Based on ABiC survey data, average landing holding of farmer is 1.2 hectares (minimum landholding is less than 0.5 hectares and maximum landholding is 200
     hectares). Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery records that average paddy yield is 2.97 tons per hectare.

 Rice exports to Russia are primarily non-fragrant rice, about one-quarter of sales to the EU last year was
 fragrant rice. The principal competitor for fragrant rice is Thailand, but Vietnam also provides competition.
 The principal competitor for non-aromatic rice is Vietnam. Demand for non-aromatic rice comes from large
 consumers such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Africa.

 Rice is exported by private traders. Despite a large number of traders, the market is dominated by ﬁve as
 shown in Figure 5.

 Rice processing
 The farmers solar dry the padi and sell their surplus at the farm gate to collectors or directly to mills. In that
 way they avoid the cost of transport. Also this is a cash transaction. Post harvest losses are on the order of
 15-20 percent depending on whether the padi was machine threshed or hand threshed.

 The only check on quality of the padi is performed at the larger mills during the sale transaction when
 measurements are taken for moisture content, percentage broken and purity.27 However, during peak buying
 times, quality control is often done manually by random checking.

 After the millers acquire padi, they pre-clean it to remove sand, straw and other large foreign matter and then
 dry it using a mechanical dryer. The husk is then removed using a rice huller and a separator to collect the
 brown rice. A de-stoning machine removes any remaining stone or metal. The rice may then be polished at the

mill if it has a polished or at a separate polishing factory. Otherwise it is sold unpolished. Additional processing
includes the use of a length grader to measure the length and thickness of the rice and a color sorter to ﬁlter
the rice into different grades.

Cambodia’s modern rice milling capacity has doubled since 2009, but there are still only 14 medium-size rice
mills located in the rice producing regions (Table 3). The average capacity of these modern mills is about 15
tons per hour but a few of the newer mills (built after 2009) have a capacity between 20 and 30 tons of padi
per hour. These have yields in the range of 65-72 percent. The smaller mills that process padi and supply rice
to the larger mills or polishing factories have a capacity of less than 10 tons of padi per day. The yields for the
smaller mills are lower due to their age, about 62 percent -64 percent.

There are four rice-polishing facilities, two each located in Battambang and Phnom Penh. Their combined
capacity is about 250,000 tons per year.

 It is estimated that over 3,000 varieties of rice are cultivated in Cambodia.28 As a result, various types of padi are
 often mixed during the farming and collecting stage. Because of the low quality of the post- harvest processing,
 lack of segregation of varieties during transport to the mill and limited quality control during milling, most of
 the rice produced is of low quality with a high proportion of broken and immature rice.

     The domestic pricing of rice for export varies by variety and percentage broken with the typical categories
     Somaly, Phkaa Khnhei and mixed white with 5 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent broken. The price
     range is +25 percent of the median value.

 Rice transport
 The transport of rice from the farm to the mill is done using small vehicles up to 10 ton trucks. The latter
 are used for deliveries from growers associations to the larger commercial mills. Trucks capable of carrying
 up to 40 tons are used for the movement of rice from the mills to Phnom Penh or other loading points. They
 are also used for the transport of padi to mills in Vietnam and Thailand. From Phnom Penh the rice is loaded
 in containers and moved by road to Sihanoukville where it is loaded onto container feeder vessels and then
 transshipped at Singapore or Hong Kong for movement to the ﬁnal destination. Rice destined for regional
 markets is moved directly from Sihanoukville to the destination on regional carriers. Beginning in September
 2011, limited quantities of uncontainerized rice have been barged down the Mekong River directly to general
 cargo vessels for loading in HCMC. The principal corridors over which the export rice moves out of the country
 are shown in the following Figure 6.

62         An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Characteristics of ﬁrms surveyed
1.    The 4 traders interviewed are locally owned rice trading companies that purchase milled rice from local mills
2.    Their principal products are white and jasmine rice. They buy both padi and milled rice from farmers
      groups and local rice millers, respectively.
3.    This is delivered to their facility by the supplier
4.    The supplier is paid cash on delivery
5.    The only problem with suppliers was inconsistent quality rice reported by one of the traders
6.    The only difﬁculty in obtaining adequate supply is that of working capital
7.    These traders export from 60-100 percent of the amount that process
8.    They sell the output primarily to Europe
9.    The product is shipped on FOB terms and sold to foreign distributors (international traders). However
      some of the Jasmine rice was sold to foreign retailers and distributors and shipped CFR
10. After export the rice receives additional processing in the form of packaging for retail purposes
11.   These traders provide rice against ﬁxed orders put in one case maintain a stock of Padi for milling
12.   The products are exported through Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville ports
13.   The time from conﬁrmation of the order to loading on the ship is 5-14 days
14.   Payment is received the time of transfer to the buyers representative
15.   There are no signiﬁcant problems with documentation by the exports
16.   The principal commercial problem is lack of working capital
17.   The principal source of competitive advantage is the quality of the product and speed of delivery followed
      by cost
18.   In order to grow the business, two traders need to increase available supplies while one sees a need
      to improve the quality of the export. For the former is necessary to expand warehouse capacity
19.   The principal factors limiting the growth are working capital and ability to invest additional capacity
20. For exports there are problems with the availability of transport
21. Two of the traders are large-scale handling 20,000-25,000 tons per year while two are smaller niche
    players handling 3,000-6,000 tons per year
22. The small traders handle orders with individual shipments whereas the large traders will also handle
    orders with multiple shipments
23. The availability of milled rice/padi varies by season but is generally delivered the same day as ordered
    or one day later
24.   The size of the orders for input varies with the larger traders ordering in the thousands of tons of smaller
      ones less than 100 tons
25. The larger traders receive daily deliveries
26. They export both white and jasmine rice
27.   The typical sizes of export shipment varies from 3 to 15 TEU
28. The larger traders try to limit their minimum shipment to 5 TEU whereas the smaller traders will

                                                  An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   63
 29. Shipments are made on a weekly basis although for the smaller shipments on a monthly basis
 30. The average value of shipments for white rice is about US$12,000-US$14,000 per container while
     for Jasmine it is about US$21,000
 31.   One of the traders arranges their own shipments but the others use forwarders
 32. Most of the rice is shipped in containers although one of the traders also ships as loose cargo
 33. The rice is transported by truck from the factory either in container or in full truckload
 34. The domestic movement is arranged by the traders and generally requires a one-week advance notice
 35. The total order cycle from order conﬁrmation to delivery to the buyers warehouse depends on
     the location of the order, for Europe this is 48-60 days but for East Asia it can be as little as 14 days
 36. There are problems in the outbound logistics in obtaining containers and arranging for transport, both
     of which need to be addressed
 37.   The percentage of delayed shipments varies by trader with the largest reporting 50 percent delays
       but the other 3 reporting 10 percent or less
 38. Most of the delays result from problems with production and difﬁculties in coordinating transportation,
     however the largest has problems with obtaining suitable quality rice at a reasonable price
 39. The typical penalty for late deliveries is only 0.1 percent of the invoice value
 40. In event of the delay they notify the buyer
 41. The time for acquiring the necessary documentation for exports is 3 days for the letter of origin, 7 days
     for the Phytosanitary certiﬁcate, one day for the fumigation certiﬁcate, four days for the quantity
     certiﬁcate and 7-12 days for the chemical tests
 42. There are no signiﬁcant problems with staying up-to-date on regulations and procedures
 43. The principal problems in the outbound supply chains are lack of reliability in terms of domestic transport,
     inefﬁcient handling at the loading port and lack of availability of customs ofﬁcials
 44. The average unit cost for semi-milled rice is US$300-US$500 per ton for white rice and US$650-
     US$750 for Jasmine rice
 45. The inputs are priced based on the spot price and are paid for in cash at time of delivery although a partial
     payment is often made at time of order
 46. The traders are reliant for ﬁnancing on their own cash ﬂow and a line of credit from a commercial bank
 47.   The terms for the lines of credit are about 9 percent interest for a one-year loan with a ﬁxed interest
       rate (foreign exchange)
 48    Communications between the traders and the buyers is by telephone, fax and e-mail
 49. The trader is paid for the exports by TT when the goods are shipped
 50. One of the traders uses letters of credit
 51.   The traders use various banks to ﬁnance their trade

 Supply chains and cash ﬂow
 Two models were examined. Both are rice trading and milling operation. The ﬁrst involves smaller volumes
 transported from Phnom Penh dry port to Sihanoukville via road. The second involves large shipments moving
 by barge from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville.

 Global production and trade
 The growth of the global textile and apparel industry is driven by increases in population and disposable
 income.29 Total revenues from the textile and apparel industry are estimated to have grown by about 30 percent
 between 2006 and 2010. During this period, trade in textile and apparel grew by only half as much due to the
 global ﬁnancial crisis, which reduced demand in both the US and EU. Despite this reduction, trade in textile
 and apparel increased by more than 100 percent over the last decade (Figure 11). The volume of trade has
 rebounded in 2010 and 2011 despite the on-going European sovereign debt crisis.

The outsourcing had the greatest impact on the US where only 4 percent of its apparel is produced domestically.
Europe has been less affected although 85-90 percent of its apparel is still imported. Nevertheless, some
European countries continue to export. The largest exporters are Italy and Germany with each contributing 5
percent to global trade. Turkey and France contribute 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, as shown in Figure
12. When intra-EU trade is considered, Italy is the second largest textile and clothing exporter in the world and
is the leader in the high value market, which has a large fashion component. Turkey has been able to achieve
strong growth in exports by creating a number of regional brands.

The principal destinations for exports of garments remain the US and the countries in the EU as shown in Figure
13. While the share of exports destined to the US and EU has remained relatively steady as shown in Table 4,
growth in demand in the last few years has come primarily from the larger emerging economies.

Market segments
The market for apparel can be divided into different segments based on the ﬁnal consumers, the fashion content
and the international buyers.

Final consumer
From the perspective of product sophistication, apparel can be classiﬁed into ﬁve main categories. The
traditional categories are men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing. Athletic clothes have emerged as a separate
category in recent years. The remaining products include accessories and miscellaneous. Each category has
different characteristics as follows.

       Women’s clothing has a signiﬁcant fashion component and a broader range of products in each of
       the subcategories from formal to work to casual.
       Men’s clothing has an increasing fashion component but remains much less than for women. The range
       of products is also smaller.
       Children’s clothing is a smaller market with fewer products because of the age range. The fashion
       component is minimal but increasing, especially in mature markets.
       Athletic clothes serve as casual clothes and sportswear. There is an increasing fashion component
       and strong emphasis on the brand
       Accessories include a wide product range most of which has a fashion component.

Consequently, women’s clothing accounts for roughly 50 percent of global trade, while men’s clothing adds up to
only 25 percent as shown in Figure 15.

 Fashion content
 Whereas, each of these segments has a fashion component, it is most important in women’s clothing and
 accessories. The fashion component can be divided into ﬁve categories, which are represented in the fashion
 pyramid shown in Figure 15. The top of the pyramid, haute couture is the smallest but most expensive, whereas
 basic garments is the largest in terms of volume but lowest in terms of cost. The characteristics of these ﬁve
 are as follows:



         Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
74       An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
           Haute couture: This is the most expensive and exclusive of all segments and consists of custom-
           made clothing from a small number of ﬁrms. Haute couture is sold exclusively at fashion shows
           and through appointments at the designer’s store. Although the market is small it has been expanding
           due to the new wealth in emerging markets such as India, China and the Middle East.

           Designer collections: All couture houses also produce ready-to-wear clothes. The mass- produced
           ready-to-wear collections are more proﬁtable because they have a larger market, but depend on the
           haute couture to preserve the brand’s image. Examples are Giorgio Armani, Christian Dior, Chanel,
           Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Emanuel Ungaro, John Galliano, and Alexander Mc Queen. The designer
           collections are sold through a small number of branded retail stores located in upscale markets.

           Fashion Basics: These mass-produced brands target middle-income households but retain a fashion
           component. They have a relative short shelf life and generally produce several collections per year.
           Examples of this segment are Inditex (Zara), H&M, Marks & Spencer, C & A, Next. Benetton, Coach,
           Polo Ralph Lauren, and Abercrombie & Fitch Company. Fashion basics are sold through a small
           number of branded retail stores located in upscale markets although the outlets are more widely
           distributed in metropolitan areas.

           Retail brands: These are similar to fashion basics but the brand is associated with the retail chain,
           which sells a variety of brands. Retail brands are distributed through large retail chains.

           Basic Apparel: These are the discount brands produced in large volumes and targeting low- income
           consumers. They are distributed through large volume retailers such as Wal-Mart J.C. Penny, Carrefour,
           Metro, Target, Kohl’s etc.

International buyers
Buyers can be divided into four categories depending on their involvement in the downstream activity. These are
branded marketers and branded manufacturers, independent buyers and global retailers.30

Branded marketers are directly involved in design and marketing but contract out the manufacturing. They set
standards and speciﬁcations for the products. They use international third party logistics service providers but
their regular manufacturers assume an increasing role in the provision of logistics. Typical examples of brand
manufacturers are Nike, Adidas etc.

Branded manufacturers are involved in the entire supply chain. They have their own factories and retail outlets
in their major markets. However, many have refocused on their core competency and outsource most or all of
their production in order to concentrate on marketing and retailing.

Global retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Carrefour and others outsource the supply of apparel through
buying agents and sell their products exclusively in their own retail outlets

Independent buyers and wholesalers/distributors act as an intermediary between garment producers and
large retailers. They oversee production and the logistics between the factory and the retailer’s distribution
center. They are also assuming responsibility for quality control and social audits. These specialists, such as
Li-Fung, are increasing their share in the market as their clients refocus on marketing and retailing

Distribution channels
Basic apparel is distributed through buyers and wholesalers, who sell to large discount chains or outlets. Haute
couture is sold at fashion shows and through appointments at the designer’s store. Retail brands are distributed
through large retail chains. The basic fashions and retail brands are purchased by the retailer either directly or
through buying agents.

                                                  An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)   75
 In recent years, distribution channels have evolved as more brand manufacturers and marketers open their own
 stores. At the same time, large retailers are developing proprietary brands using either in-house design teams
 or brand marketers. Their production is often outsourced to one or more foreign factories. The large retailers
 are also using different sources for fashion and basic apparel. While for brand manufacturers quick market
 response and ﬂexibility are important, large retailers place mire value on low costs.

 The role of intermediaries in the distribution channel has also changed. Some manufacturers manage their
 global supply chains and act as direct suppliers to the buyers. In contrast, many retailers use buying agents that
 provide a broad range of services including basic design and product development, quality control and supply
 chain management, and monitoring the performance of factories with regards to social and environmental
 standards.

 Finally the relationship between supplier and buyer is changing as the development of global supply networks
 creates demand for greater reliability. This has led to diversiﬁcation away from a single source or multiple
 sources within a single country. At the same time, it has meant a reduction in the number of suppliers and
 encouraged longer-term relationships with larger suppliers that serve multiple clients.

 Value proposition
 The branded retail chains used for fashion basics, e.g. H&M, Zara, Gap, Benetton, Diesel, introduced the concept
 of fast-changing fashions. They increased the frequency of design changes (seasons) and focused on providing
 an image for their fashion-oriented consumers. This implied a larger design component but focused on trends
 rather than on original designs. The variety of colors and sizes increased, while prices were kept reasonable.
 They also signiﬁcantly improved the performance of their supply chains in order to provide

       Fast development cycles, with smaller batches and greater variety to offer customers the latest designs
       in limited quantities to provide a sense of exclusivity;

       Increased information and supply chain transparency to better monitor in-store stocks, to respond quickly
       to consumer demand, to supply the design and marketing departments with real-time information on
       sales and to deliver new fashion lines just-in-time; and

       A large retail network covering all major cities of a country/continent. For example, H&M has 2,300
       stores (in 43 countries), Mango 2,000 stores (in 103 countries) and Zara more than 1,000 stores worldwide.

 Despite the great reliance on fast production and efﬁcient logistics, not all companies operating in this segment
 have their own factories. For example, Gap, Mango and H&M do not have their own production facilities and
 outsource all production while others outsource only part of their production.

 Production of garments and textiles
 The complete supply chain for apparel begins with the production of the textiles and ends with the distribution
 of the apparel to different retail outlets as diagrammed in Figure 16. The production of textiles follows the
 ﬂowing sequence spinning and either weaving or knitting the yarn then dyeing or printing the fabric and
 ﬁnishing the fabric. For some fabric, dyeing is done before weaving. The ﬁnishing process for fabrics includes
 various treatments to change the appearance, durability, etc. Mechanical spinning is used for natural ﬁbers,
 while melt spinning of the polymer is used for synthetic ﬁbers. Natural ﬁbers are usually woven while
 synthetic yarn is normally knitted.

or the buyer’s representative who contracts the              production activity

of the garment manufacturer are cutting, making,

assigned to the manufacturer. The business models                                            Fabric

activities.

One variation involves vertical integration with the
                                                                   Uncut or

more of the activities in producing the fabric as shown
in Figure 17. Dyeing and ﬁnishing involves the least               Unﬁnished              Trim and
investment and labor, but simpliﬁes the sourcing of                Garments              Accessories

capital intensive and also requires a larger labor
force.

 In order to ensure an efﬁcient weaving operation, the garment manufacturer continues to obtain some fabric
 from other producers and the weaving operation sells part of its output to other manufacturers.

 Alternative business models
 The extent of backwards integration is one of the parameters that deﬁne the business model applied by a
 garment manufacturer. The other parameters relate to design and marketing.

 Assembly/CMT (cut, make and trim) is the simplest model. The manufacturer produces the garments but is
 not involved in design of the garment or the sourcing of the fabric. The manufacturer is paid a processing fee,
 and uses fabric sourced, and in some cases produced, by the buyer.

 Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM)/FOB/Package Contractor is a model in which the manufacturer
 sources and procures the fabric and produces the garments. The buyer provides exact speciﬁcations as well as
 the design. A manufacturer with backwards integration may also produce the fabric.

 Original Design Manufacturing (ODM)/Full Package Contractor is a model in which the manufacturer
 carries out all steps involved in the production, including design, sourcing and procuring fabric, and distribution
 of garments. The buyer approves the design and material used for production through an exchange of samples
 produced by the manufacturer. In some cases, the manufacturer may also produce the fabric.

 Original Brand Manufacturing (OBM) is a stand-alone business in which the manufacturer sells products that
 are designed and produced under the company’s own brand. The manufacturer may also produce the fabric but
 the actual manufacturing is frequently subcontracted. The ﬁrm may act as the supplier by taking control of the
 distribution channel but the buyer often retains this responsibility.

 Supply chain performance
 The demands on supply chain performance increase as the value of garments rises (Figure 18). Higher value
 garments have a greater fashion component and, therefore, a shorter shelf life. They require shorter order
 cycles and, at the same time, greater attention must be given to managing product inventory to avoid either stock
 outage or overstock. In order for local manufacturers to win orders from producers of higher value garments,
 they need to improve not only the quality of their production but also the performance of the inbound and
 outbound supply chains including quality control. In many situations, an increase in garment value is associated
 with sourcing a greater variety of higher value inputs. It also involves a greater variety of order sizes, both for
 the initial orders and restocking. These changes require faster setup times for production lines and better
 management of both inbound and outbound supply chains and the associated transactions. The manufacturer
 must improve the rate of order fulﬁllment by providing on-time delivery of products in good condition. While
 there may be less emphasis on delivered cost relative to delivery time and order fulﬁllment, the manufacturer
 still expect the manufacturer to control the costs of both of inputs and production.

Cambodia’s garment industry
The value of Cambodia’s garment exports grew at a relatively uniform rate until the global ﬁnancial crisis
caused a contraction as shown in Figure 19. Its contribution to the global trade rose from 0.33 percent in
1998 to 0.95 percent in 2011. The contribution of the apparel industry to Cambodia’s GDP rose from around
1 percent in the early 1990s to about 10 percent in 2009. The apparel and footwear industry accounted for an
increasing portion of total industrial output until 2005, when it contribution leveled of at 55 percent as shown
in Figure 20.

 The growth in exports was achieved through an increase in FDI, which lead to a rapid growth in the number
 of factories and associated employment. Beginning in 2008, there was a contraction with the result that new
 investments came to a halt (Figure 21), and a number of factories closed while others merged. The recovery,
 which began in 2010, has returned output to pre-crisis level, however, the employment has recovered only
 slightly and the number of factories has remains relatively stable (Figure 22). Current employment is a little
 above 300,000 of which 92 percent are female.31

 Only about 6 percent of the garment factories in Cambodia are owned by local investors. The foreign factories
 are owned primarily by investors from Taiwan, China and, Hong Kong as shown in Figure 23. Most of the foreign-
 owned ﬁrms are vendor factories managed by the overseas headquarters of their parent company. These
 factories have little discretion over the inputs and minimal contact with the buyer.

The headquarters allocates orders from the buyers to the factory based on its capacity, unit costs, and
skill level relative to the other factories owned by the parent company. It then arranges for delivery
of inputs as well as shipping of the exports. As a result, the individual factories have little ability to attract
orders or to identify markets into which they could expand.

Most of the factories are located around Phnom Penh or in Kandal Province. While some are located in the
Export Processing Zones, most are outside because there is little difference since inputs can be imported
duty free.

             Annex Box 1: Cambodia OEM factory
             One large company factory in Phnom Penh operates as an OEM. It is part of a Group that most
             of its operations in South Asia but also has stand-alone factories in Cambodia, Mauritania and
             Madagascar. The one in Phnom Penh, which has about 3000 employees, serves Gap.

             Gap presents various styles to its contract manufacturers and asks for bids. The Group presents
             bid but factory contributes to cost estimate. The factory will take orders of 10 thousand to 1
             million but do not take orders for rapid replenishment. If they require additional capacity, they
             subcontract other factories.

             Gap nominates the suppliers and forwarder. Fabrics are sourced from ﬁve suppliers in China,
             India and Pakistan. The factory arranges procurement from these suppliers because group has
             no particular advantage since material is not from Bangladesh. The fabric is usually shipped on
             a CFR basis with payment on receipt in Sihanoukville, CAD using a TT. For this transaction they
             use HSBC because of limitations on both Bangladesh and Cambodian banks. They do not use a
             L/C because the Gap effectively acts as guarantor.

             Once the order is conﬁrmed, the factory has 90 days to deliver to nominated forwarders. The
             time for procurement of fabric is generally 30 days plus time to Cambodia for a total of 45
             days. Samples are prepared to test for ﬁtting, washing and pre-production and approved by
             GAP headquarters in SF. These involve relatively short turnaround times. Trim is obtained from
             a variety of sources, e.g. zippers from HK, buttons from India and thread and packaging from
             Vietnam, but these require less time for delivery. Production generally requires about 30 days.

             Exports are shipped to Gap’s distribution center in forty foot containers with ocean transport
             arranged by GAP’s nominated forwarder. Goods are shipped CFA with payment CAD and TT not
             L/C. When shipments are delayed, they consult with GAP. About 1 percent of the shipments end
             up being sent via Air-Sea

             At present, there is no demand to reduce order time. They could try to produce fabrics locally,
             but Cambodia has no tradition for textile manufacturing. They could produce their own synthetic
             knitwear as is done in Bangladesh, but there is no justiﬁcation for this investment. The factory
             does some washing and occasional over-dyeing, but see no beneﬁ t in trying to establish a dyeing
             and ﬁnishing operation.

             Marketing and costing are done at the Group headquarters while merchandising is done through
             its India ofﬁce. They use local banks to manage documents and local ﬁnancial transactions.
             Otherwise they manage their cash-to-cash from internal funds.

 The average level of employment per factory is about 1100. The largest are those with Taiwanese
 and Malaysian owners with an average of about 1,500 employees while locally owned factories average less
 than 600 and Chinese ﬁrms about 650.33 About a quarter of the ﬁrms employ less than 500. The largest
 factories employ 6,000-9,000.

           Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
82         An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Cambodia has no domestic suppliers of fabrics, threads, accessories and trim. Local inputs are limited
to packaging materials. About 70 percent of the fabric is imported from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong
and another 16 percent from Southeast Asia. A large proportion is ordered by the large foreign-owned
factories, which order from suppliers that have a relationship with the parent company and are very often
from the same country. For the factories that procure fabric, most do so according to the buyer’s speciﬁcations
and in many cases, from suppliers designated by the buyer.

There are a large number of buyers of the apparel exports. These include retailers from all segments, brand
marketers and retail chains. However, GAP is estimated to account for 30 percent of the production and the 15
largest buyers, which include H&M and Levi Strauss, Nike and Adidas and C&A and Target, purchase over half
of the exports.

 Exports are mostly high-volume, low value-added products intended for the low and medium market
 segment in the US and to a lesser extent in the EU. Most of the exports are made from imported fabric
 (Figure 26). The majority of exports are knitted and the proportion has been increasing over the past years
 as shown in Figure 27. Knitted garments typically include items such as T-shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts
 and polo shirts while trousers, shirts, and jackets are normally classiﬁed as woven garments. Of all the
 different products, seven account for 60 percent of the exports as shown in Table 6. The majority of
 the garments are cotton. For the exports to the US in 2010, 75 percent was made from cotton, a small
 portion from wool and the rest from synthetic ﬁbers.

 The contraction in 2008-09 was caused by a number of factors in addition to the global ﬁnancial crisis and
 current European debt crisis. These include:
           increased competition from China in the low end of the market (basic garments);
           reduced trade restrictions on Vietnam and China by Europe and the US;
           increasing wages relative to its competitors; and
           higher logistics costs.

During this period of slack demand, the buyers have been able to negotiate lower prices, introduce more
favorable payment terms, shorten their order cycle and require higher rates for order-fulﬁllment. These
changes are unlikely to continue even after the economic recovery.

The challenge for the Cambodian apparel industry, aside from diversifying its market and reducing energy and
labor costs, is to adjust its production to changing market conditions. At the same time, it will have to increase
the unit value of its exports. Therefore, it must reverse the slide that has occurred primarily in the US market
over the last decade (Figure 28).

Cambodia has an extensive network of Special Economic Zones that were developed to attract new investment
and provide an environment that would stimulate the growth in exports. However, this has had very limited
impact. Most of the Zones are either non-operation or have few locators. Only a few are successful, but these
have attracted a potpourri of investors rather than creating clusters which would beneﬁt speciﬁc industries.
Perhaps most telling is the preference of garment factories to remain outside of these zones allowing them
more alternatives in choosing a site for their factories while retaining most of the beneﬁts that the zone offer
such as duty free import of inputs and bonded storage.

 Summary of ﬁrms surveyed
     1.    Of the ﬁve ﬁrms surveyed three dealt primarily with knitted fabrics and the others with woven
           textiles
     2.    All of the textiles are imported from either the original manufacturer or foreign distributors
     3.    All the ﬁrms use multiple suppliers but predominantly from China. A few ﬁrms also use material from
           Southeast Asia
     4.    All ﬁrms have difﬁculties with uncertainty of supply and price variations. Problems with delays
           indelivery or quality control were less prevalent.
     5.    The ﬁrms produce primarily women’s’ wear for North America but one ﬁrm shipped primarily to the EU
     6.    All production is on a ﬁxed order basis with the exported products ready for retail
     7.    Demand for the products is subject to seasonal ﬂuctuation, however, most products are not subject
           to variation in fashion and have a relatively long shelf lives
     8.    The typical order cycle, up to the point of shipment, is either 45 or 90 days depending on order size
           and source of fabric
     9.    The time for international transport up to the buyer’s warehouse is typically 14-30 days
     10. During periods of peak demand, orders would rise by about 25 percent. In order to meet the additional
         demand, ﬁrms extend their working hours, add production lines and/or subcontract order ﬁrms
     11.   The ﬁrms indicated they shipped about 5 percent by air and the rest by ocean
     12.   While the time for payment vary according to the buy, it was typically 7-30 days after loading
           onto the transport for export
     13.   Each of the ﬁrms had difﬁculties with the time and the cost required for import permits and customs
           declarations, both, however the most serious delays occur when waiting for the certiﬁcate of origin
           which can only be issued after shipment and can take 5-10 days.
     14.   To obtain approval for Customs declarations for inputs often poses a problem because of the limited
           availability of Customs ofﬁcials. This process can take around 5-7 days.
     15.   The principal ﬁnancial risk faced by the ﬁrms was the variation in demand and pricing. Issues with
           the logistics were not cited
     16.   The ﬁrms did not distinguish between cost, quality and uniqueness of product in terms of their
           contribution to competitive advantage
     17.   The ﬁrms expect to grow their business through increasing volume. Only two indicated that
           they contemplated increasing the unit value of the products they produce
     18.   The principal constraints to growth are the perceived lack of demand followed by difﬁculties with
           retaining skilled labor and securing adequate supplies of energy
     19.   Difﬁculties with the inbound supply chain include the availability of inputs followed by customs
           formalities. For the outbound supply chain, there are problems with certiﬁcate of origin and
           customs formalities
     20. Inputs are ordered as both single and multiple shipments
     21.   The order time for imported inputs range from 21 to 55 days with shipments ranging in value
           between US$200,000 and US$900,000 or 4-12 TEU
     22. Inputs are received on a weekly basis with shipments organized by the manufacturer who ships
         them primarily on FOB basis
     23. The ﬁrms operate in a duty-free zone and goods are kept there until the time they are exported

    24.   The cost for moving the container from Sihanoukville port to the factories warehouse ranges
          from US$715-US$905 which presumably includes the terminal handling charge; for exports
          the range is US$470-US$1,000
    25. A major cost of production is electricity. Depending on their size, factories spend between US$25,000
        and US$117,000 per month
    26. A typical shipment ranges in size from 1 to 20 containers. Shipment size depends on the size of
        the ﬁrm and the season, but most ﬁrms will not accept shipments less than one container load
    27.   Products are shipped on a weekly basis
    28. During the peak season between May and October volumes increased by 15-60 percent
    29. The average value of export shipments varies from US$110,000 to US$325,000
    30. Between 1 percent and 5 percent of the exports are shipped by air, the rest by ocean
    31.   Most shipments are arranged by forwarders
    32. Trucking ﬁrms are given 5-7 days advanced notice for transport from factory to the port.
    33. The average time from start of production to delivery to the ports is usually 2 weeks but can extend
        up to 30 days.
    34. Delays occur usually for 3-5 percent of shipments but one ﬁrm experienced delays in half of their
        shipments. These delays are caused by problems in delivery of supplies and delays in production.
    35. When a shipment is delayed, the ﬁrms notify the buyer and in some cases switch transport modes
    36. The rate of rejection of shipments due to shortfalls or damage is 2 percent-5 percent with the result
        that the buyer merely deducts the amount of the shortfall from the total payment
    37.   There are problems with obtaining information on current Customs regulations. Sources of
          information include government, forwarders and GMAC
    38. The ﬁrms use both forwarding agents and individual customs brokers to clear their goods ﬁrms used
    39. Customs is seen as the biggest problem on both inbound and outbound supply chains
    40. Imports are purchased through direct negotiation of contracts for a speciﬁc quantity, however,
        all inputs are normally provided by the buyer.
    41. Payments for imported inputs are made by arranging a speciﬁc time after shipment using time
        drafts (TT). Only two ﬁrms used an L/C.
    42. Typically the period of payment is 7-45 days after receipt of goods
    43. Most communication with the buyer is through fax or e-mail
    44. Four of the ﬁve ﬁrms obtain funds to purchase the inputs by factoring the LC from the buyer
    45. Payment for exports is received using a TT with a ﬁxed period after delivery of the goods to
        the buyer’s warehouse. However, in some cases exports are paid according to a ﬁxed schedule.
    46. The only cargo insurance is arranged by the freight forwarder.
    47.   None of the firms have a foreign exchange hedging strategy, potentially because they are
          foreign-owned factories.

Flow charts
The ﬁrms surveyed were all vendor factories. As a result they had very similar supply chains of which an
example is shown below. They did not have signiﬁcant cash ﬂows because all transactions were handled by
their overseas headquarters. As a result the principal focus of the factory managers outside of production
was the domestic movement inputs and exports and the clearance of imported inputs and exports at the
international gateway, which in nearly all cases was the port of Sihanouk Ville.

       Annex III: Footwear

Global trade
Global Market and Centers of Production
Global revenue in the footwear industry has increased steadily. In 2005, it was about US$114 billion and
US$127 billion in 2010, implying and average annual growth of about 2.2 percent. The continuing global
ﬁnancial crisis has depressed this rate with growth in 2010 reduced to 0.8 percent. The impact of the economic
situation can also be observed within geographical regions. In 2010, for example, demand was noticeably weaker
in Europe’s periphery while demand in the US picked up in 2010 only to level off in 2011. Currently, China and
Japan are generating signiﬁcant growth in footwear consumption.34 Over the long term, a steady increase in
global shoe production is expected to continue driven both by population and increase in disposable income.

Because the production of footwear, especially shoes, requires a signiﬁcant input of semi-skilled labor, more so
than for the manufacture of garments, there has been a natural gravitation of the industry towards countries
that can offer the combination of skills and low wages. This led to the outsourcing of production beginning
in Japan in the 1970s. Since the 1980s, there has been a gradual shift in the center of production to Taiwan,
then South Korea and China. Now a further shift is the beginning to South Asia. Currently, most footwear is
manufactured in Asia, Latin America and Europe although the latter is declining sharply. The largest region
producing footwear is North Asia, with China producing about 7 billion pairs (2010) or 57 percent of the world’s
footwear production. The second largest producing region is South East Asia. Vietnam produced about 1
billion pairs in 2010 or around 8 percent of world production. Indonesia and Thailand were important shoe
manufacturers prior to the Asian ﬁnancial crisis and have only partly recovered since then.

South Asia accounts for about 9.6 percent of world production led by India, which has attracted many investors
from US, Europe and Taiwan. They are interested in producing mid-price shoes for both the domestic market
and for export. However, the growth rate for India is slower than for China. The second largest producer in South
Asia is Bangladesh, which is rapidly expanding its production.35 Latin American accounts for about 6.9 percent
of world production with the Brazilian footwear industry accounting for about 90 percent of the production.

Europe provides about 5.3 percent of global production. Italy produce premium-quality footwear accounting
for more than a third of Europe’s output. Low-cost producers have moved their factories to Eastern Europe,
but face strong competition from manufacturers in Asia. Turkey is also a major producer. The North American
footwear manufacturing industry has been in decline for several decades. In 2009, the US and Mexico accounted
for only 2.5 percent and 1.9 percent of the world production, respectively.36

The major markets for imported footwear remain North America, Europe and high-income countries in Asia e.g.
Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore. However, in the future, the share of total production consumed in these countries
will decline as consumption increases in China, India, Brazil and Southeast Asia, and other producing countries.

 International Trade
 International trade in footwear has increased signiﬁcantly as barriers to trade have been reduced and the relative
 cost of international transport has declined. Also distribution networks have become more international as
 consumer’s preferences changed.37

 Demand for imports to the US has been relatively stable ﬂuctuating between 2 and 2.4 billion pairs between
 2004 and 2010. The majority has been supplied by China (~85 percent) followed by Vietnam (~7 percent). The
 remainder was source from 19 countries. Cambodia’s contribution, while still small, has grown from nothing in
 2005 to over 3.2 million pairs.38

 A similar picture can be drawn for the European market (EU-27). China is the leading supplier of footwear
 products with a 72.6 percent market share followed by Vietnam with 11.9 percent. India and Indonesia are
 also important suppliers with market shares of 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent respectively. In total, the EU-27
 countries import about 2.5 billion pairs of shoes. Of this, Cambodia provided about 21.5 million, slightly less
 than 1 percent of the imports.39

 The rate of growth of China’s footwear exports has begun to slow in recent years, due to increasing wages,
 increases in tariffs on imports to the EU, and efforts to diversify suppliers. This led to a migration of export
 manufacturers to South East Asia, especially Vietnam, to take advantage of cheaper labor and production
 costs. At the same time, India attracted investments from footwear manufacturers in the US, Italy and Taiwan.

 While the trend for both the US and EU markets is a slow increase in the average price per pair for imports,
 Cambodia has experienced a slight decrease in its average price for exports to the US but continues to export
 higher value footwear than Vietnam and China. In Europe, Cambodia’s exports have experienced an increase in
 average value and have remained at a higher level than China and Vietnam as shown in the ﬁgures below.

The decisions on where to produce the different categories of shoes depends on labor costs and two other
factors:

        Type and availability of materials
        Fashion component

The ﬁrst is an important consideration for the production of shoes with leather components since sourcing
higher quality leather is difﬁcult and there is considerable competition. The production of hides and tanned
leather is typically a small-scale activity and most producing countries depend on local sources for a majority
of their production. Synthetic materials, including synthetic leather is relatively easy to obtain given the uniform
quality standards for different grades of synthetic resins, the scale of production and the concentration
of petrochemical plants in countries that are not major producers of footwear. Fashion is an important
consideration as it determines where design is executed. This has allowed high value producers such as Italy to
retain market share in terms of the value of exports. However, increasingly the production is being outsourced
initially through FDI and now through marketing arrangements.
The importance of these two factors varies with the different segments of the market, but is especially
important in the production of women’s footwear and athletic shoes.

 Market segments
 The footwear industry is segmented not only by the materials used but also by the end user. The general
 categorization is as follows:
 In terms of global revenues, women’s shoes are the largest product type with a 31.2 percent market share.
 They have a very high fashion component and style changes regularly. In wealthier countries, woman purchase
 multiple pairs for different occasions. Because a signiﬁcant portion of the value is in the design, these may be
 designed and produced competitively in the developed countries, but increasingly production of even the
 higher-value shoes are being outsourced to developing country producers.

 Men’s shoes account for roughly 24 percent of global revenues. These shoes have a lower fashion- component
 and therefore a longer shelf life. They can be mass-produced in countries with low-labor cost using less
 sophisticated machinery. While synthetic leather has become an increasingly important segment of men’s
 footwear, the demand for leather shoes remains strong and availability of leather limits the countries that can
 compete in this segment.

 Athletic footwear (both men and women) has become the most identiﬁable segment of the market. It is
 dominated by a handful of international brand manufacturers, such as Nike and Adidas. These companies
 design and market their products. They outsource the production but retain a signiﬁcant role in monitoring
 production to insure the quality of the product and conformance with health and safety standards and good
 labor practices.

 Children shoes account for only 8 percent of industry revenue. While there is a growing segment that emphasizes
 quality, design, and, brand, most of the market focuses on cost and durability. As a result, these shoes are
 usually produced in countries with low labor cost.

 Others account for about 8.2 percent of industry revenue. At the low-end are slippers (house slippers, slipper
 socks and leather slippers). They represent 4.1 percent in terms of global revenues but much more in terms of
 pairs. These are mass-produced in low-wage countries. At the mid-value level is safety footwear that typically
 includes steel cap shoes, water shoes and. The remainders are niche products and include higher-value sport
 shoes (ski shoes, football, ballet, hiking, golf, etc).

Value proposition
The footwear market can be divided into sub-markets differentiated in terms of quality, cost and time for
delivery. The most basic division is based on quality. High-value footwear includes men’s leather shoes, women’s
shoes and internationally branded athletic shoes. These require high quality in terms of inputs, ﬁt and ﬁnish.
Design is also an important source of value especially for athletic shoes and women’s shoes. Quality control
is important throughout the supply chain, from sourcing of inputs through delivery to the buyer. The average
ex-works value of these products ranges from US$10 a pair and up. The buyers are larger brand manufacturers
or high-end retailers. Principal markets are Europe and North America although there is growing demand in
higher income developing countries, too. The logistics used for this segment emphasize high reliability both
inbound and outbound. On the inbound supply chain, consistency in the quality of inputs are critical whereas for
outbound it is important to deliver consignments with many different models and styles at ﬁxed delivery dates.

The mid-value products cover the ﬁve basic types: men’s, women’s, kid‘s and athletic shoes, and specialty
footwear. These use a mix of materials, textiles, plastics (including synthetic leather) and rubber. The inputs
are mid-value but consistent in quality and the level of automation varies with product type and scale. The
designs are variations on standard designs. Buyers are wholesalers and large retail chains and logistics strike
a compromise between cost and reliability.

Lower-value footwear includes simple shoes and sandals produced from plastics. These use less expensive
inputs and are less durable. The designs are standard. Production of those allows for more automation as
well as higher volumes. The average value ex-works ranges between US$2-4 per pair. Buyers are primarily
wholesalers selling to low-end retailers. There is strong demand for these products both domestically and
for export but there is also strong competition from manufacturers in China. As for the logistics requirements,
volumes are large and value in terms of cost per pair is low. For inbound logistics, priority is given to
on-time delivery to support a lean production schedule. For outbound logistics, the volumes are large with
consignments having only a few models but a full range of sizes and colors and the emphasis is on minimizing
cost while maintaining reasonable delivery times.

Global production and employment
While the number of pairs of shoes produced between 2006 and 2010 increased by about 4.5 percent,
employment in the sector is estimated to have grown by about 6.5 percent. During this period wages as a
proportion of total revenues declined from 18.3-16.5 percent due to the migration of production to lower wage
cost countries continued. Premium-quality, high-value shoes continue to be produced in Western countries.
Based on value, nine European countries are among the top 15 exporters of footwear. Italy, Spain and Portugal
account for about 23 percent of total export value. On the other hand, most of the production in China, Indonesia
and other large manufacturing countries are predominantly low or low- medium value. Only a few countries
such as Thailand and Brazil produce med-high value shoes.

Footwear supply chain
There is a distinct division of activity in the footwear industry. Production takes place primarily in developing and
emerging market economies while design and marketing takes place in North America, Europe and East Asia.

Countries that were major production centers in the past e.g. South Korea and Taiwan, have managed to convert
themselves from domestic manufactures to managers of overseas factories and distributors of footwear
manufactured overseas. They are a signiﬁcant source of FDI for new factories in developing countries and
manage the distribution of branded products. Hong Kong and other trading centers act a buying agents and
wholesales for unbranded footwear produced by local manufacturers.

 The brand is built and managed by global and regional headquarters with support from large distributors,
 especially in less developed markets. The inputs, quality and design, are strongly related to the product design
 and hence the marketing of the product.

 Sourcing of raw materials is generally arranged at the manufacturing level subject to quality requirements
 developed as part of the design. As indicated previously, the sourcing of leather is the most challenging. This
 involves acquiring from slaughterhouses hides of suitable quality from various animals, tanning the hides (an
 environmentally challenging process), and processing the leather to obtain a suitable ﬁnish. Acquiring and
 tanning the leather is relatively low skill unlike producing ﬁnished goods.

 Footwear production
 The sequence of footwear production begins with sourcing of material, accessories and components. The
 suppliers include leather tanners, manufacturers of synthetic resins, canvas and other textiles, and producers
 of insoles and outsoles, shoe lasts, and accessories. The insoles and outsoles are made of different materials
 including rubber, PVC and polyurethane. These can be purchased in molded form (most common), pre-trimmed
 in standard sizes or in uncut sheets. Shoe lasts are obtained from both local producers or imported. Materials
 such as chemicals, buckles, threads, foam, etc., are usually sourced locally but include some imported materials.

 The production sequence begins with preparation of samples either at the request of individual buyers or to
 promote existing models. The designs may be obtained from the buyer, especially for high value footwear.
 For footwear with a limited fashion component, manufacturers often revise existing designs sourced from
 magazines, retail stores and other sources.

 Once an order is received and conﬁrmed, procurement of materials begins. Only a few of the inputs are
 maintained in inventory. First, the patterns and lasts are prepared for the required sizes. Once all inputs
 have been delivered, production begins. The materials are cut based on patterns. This is done manually by
 craftsman except for manufacturers handling very large orders. Machines are used for skiving and sewing.
 The next step is the assembly process, which involves shaping the uppers on the lasts and attaching the
 inner sole and then the outer sole. Once assembled, the shoe is taken for roughing, ﬁnishing and ﬁnal quality
 checks before being shipped. Complete production of a pair of shoes normally takes two days. A typical
 footwear ﬁrm using manual production produces an average of 1,000 pairs per day. This volume can increase
 to 3,000-5,000 pairs with semi-automated processes. Large factories in China, Bangladesh and elsewhere
 can produce over 10,000 pairs per day.

 Cambodia’s footwear industry
 In Cambodia, the footwear industry is relatively small consisting of about 37 export-oriented factories. Most
 are owned by investors primarily from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan. In recent years, the number of factories
 has increased rapidly. Twenty plants have been opened since 2008, most of them in the past two years that
 were branches of existing ﬁrms. Over the next ﬁve years, the industry is expected to continue its expansion,
 growing by another 50-80 percent. Most of the plants are located in Phnom Penh and Kandal Province. Total
 production is around 50 million pairs, less than 0.4 percent of total current world production.

 Most factories are merely production facilities managed by their owners, who also control the input supply
 chain. However, some of the facilities operate as OEMs and produce products directly for the buyers.

 These factories produce primarily leather shoes as shown in Figure 33. The average value per pair has been
 increasing (Figure 34) but remains very low at about US$4.25 per pair. Textile shoes have an average value
 of US$9, which still relatively low. The typical factory has about 1,500 employees but some manufacturers
 employ up to 6,000 workers. Total employment in the sector amounts to around 70,000. Wages are slightly
 higher than in other industrial sectors because it is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd and retain qualiﬁed personnel. The
 average monthly wage is US$61 base wage and US$30-40 in overtime and bonuses. These are slightly
 higher than in China. Average productivity per worker is between four and eight pairs per day.

 Most of the inputs including soles and the leather for the upper parts are imported. In 2010, the Cambodia
 customs reported exports of footwear amounting to about US$180 million. The data from the importing
 countries indicated about three times this amount. Some of the discrepancy can be explained by the difference
 between FOB and CFR prices, but it still suggests a signiﬁcant under-reporting. More importantly, there is a
 signiﬁcant difference in terms of commodity classiﬁcation, primarily for plastic/synthetic footwear. Both sets
 of data indicate the dominance of leather shoes, but the mirror data suggests a growing proportion of plastic
 and textile footwear.

     The EU is the principal destination accounting for around 60 percent of total exports. The United Kingdom
     (23 percent), Germany (15 percent) and Italy (6 percent) are the largest individual markets within the EU. Other
     large buyers are Japan (16 percent) and the United States (9 percent). Most of the shoes produced are casual
     shoes, sports shoes and sandals with some waterproof and safety shoes. Around 60 percent of all shoes are for
     woman, 30 percent for men and 10 percent for children. About 80 percent are made with leather uppers and 10
     percent each for synthetic and textile uppers. There is only little variation in demand by season.

Characteristics of ﬁrms surveyed
     1.                        The ﬁve factories surveyed are all production facilities for foreign vendors who manage the orders
                               from the buyers.
     2.                        These factories use imported leather and fabric obtained from Asian sources, primarily from East
                               Asia, China, Taiwan and South Korea.
     3.                        The leather is obtained directly from the tanneries whereas the fabric is ordered from suppliers
                               nominated by the buyers.
     4.                        The principal difﬁculty with the inputs is the consistency and quality especially for the leather. This
                               delays production and deliveries.
     5.                        These factories produce a mix of products but generally specialize in one or two, e.g. men’s shoes,
                               women shoes, kids shoes.
     6.                        The principal destinations for exports are Japan and the EU.
     7.                        Most of the output is purchased by the factory’s foreign headquarters rather than directly by
                               the buyers.
     8.                        The products are produced against ﬁxed orders and manufactured ready for retail.
     9.                        The shelf life of the products is 3-6 months reﬂecting seasonal demand.
     10. Order cycle from when the initial order is conﬁrmed to when the ﬁrst shipment is loaded onto
         the vessel is 60-90 days for new orders and 30 days for repeat orders. Another 12 to 20 days is
         required for the transport by ocean to the importers warehouse.
     11.                       During peak periods, the increase in orders are handled by extending the working hours.
     12.                       The percent of shipments outside the region that use airfreight varies from less than 3 percent
                               for three of the factories to 10-20 percent for the other two.




                                                                                          Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
                                                                    An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)                          99
       13.   Payment for exports account received within 7-30 days after shipment, either ex-factory or when
             the goods are loaded on the vessel.
       14.   The documents that present the greatest problem are the permits and technical certiﬁcates for
             the imported inputs. The time for obtaining the permits is supposed the only one day but normally
             takes 3-5 days.
       15.   For the exports there are difﬁculties with both the certiﬁcate of origin and the customs declaration.
             For the former there are additional problems associated in with correcting minor mistakes. For
             the latter customs will clear could setup factory.
       16.   The major ﬁnancial risks are those associated with not only ﬂuctuation demand and prices also
             ﬂuctuation in exchange rates.
       17.   The current approach to growing the business is to increase the volume of orders by improving
             the quality of the product, reducing the cost and speed of delivery. The reduction in cost includes
             the transport costs although these are not major cost components.
       18.   The principal factors limiting the growth of the factories are the availability of skilled labor and
             reliable energy.
       19.   Financing for investment and working capital are not important since this is the responsibility of
             the headquarters.
       20. The factories varied in terms of the amount of imported inputs delivered by air. The maximum was
           60 percent for one of the factories but two of the others use no airfreight.
       21.   The average time for delivery of the imported inputs was 30-45 days.
       22. Some of the orders involve multiple shipments.
       23. These shipments are received on a weekly basis.
       24.   Shipments are arranged by the supplier but are shipped FOB.
       25. These inputs are imported duty-free.
       26. The smallest size shipment of exports is 1-2 TEU or 3,000-5,000 pairs.
       27.   An average shipment has a value between US$110,000 and US$550,000.
       28. Exports are shipped on a weekly basis.
       29. Peak shipments occur between June and October when the volumes shipped increase by 45-100
           percent.
       30. All shipments arranged by forwarders or shipping lines and nearly all are shipped in containers
           which are loaded at the factory.
       31.   In general 5-7 days were required to arrange the domestic transport to the ports/airport.
       32. Delayed shipments were 5 percent or less for three of the factories but 20-50 percent for the other
           two with the principal cause being delays in receiving inputs often complemented by delays
           in production.
       33. When this occurs, the factory notiﬁes their headquarters which in turn informs the buyer.
       34. Only one of the factories reported having a high rate of rejection of their shipments due to damage
           or shortfalls. This results in an average discount of 8 percent on the payment.
       35. The principal certiﬁcation for the exports is the certiﬁcate of origin which requires 3-5 days to obtain.
       36. The inputs are ordered through long-term contracts.
       37.   Typical value for inputs range from US$15,000-US$55,000 per container.

    38. These are paid for using a TT with payment made at the time of delivery to the forwarder’s warehouse
        or the vessel or a speciﬁed time thereafter, 15-40 days.
    39. Most orders are handled through fax or e-mail.
    40. The cost of delivering the container from the port to the factory is US$400-US$700 for 20-foot
        container and US$600-US$1,000 for a 40 foot container.
    41. A similar cost is incurred for the movement of the goods from the factory to the loading ports/
        airport.
    42. Cargo insurance is arranged by the forwarder.

Global production and trade
Production
Silk production has its origin in China, where it is produced for a few hundred years. Today more than 60 countries
in the world produce silk. Most producers are located in Asia, which accounts for roughly 90 percent of mulberry
production and almost 100 percent of non-mulberry silk. However, in recent years, mulberry silk production
has also been established in less-traditional silk countries such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Egypt and Madagascar.40

The role of developing countries has increased strongly in the production of silk over the past decades. The silk
sector employs an estimated 1.8 million people, mainly in rural areas. More than half of them, around 1 million,
produce silk in China. Silk production is particularly important to rural areas, as not much land or capital is
required. Also sericulture provides an income opportunity for woman and older family members and therefore
counteracts urbanization.

As can be seen in the chart above, global silk production is by far dominated by China and India (both by value
and weight). Together they accounted for a production of about 124,000 tons in 2009. The next largest producer,
Uzbekistan, Brazil, Thailand and Vietnam produced a total of only 2.8 million tons.41 Cambodia produced
somewhere between 250 and 350 tons.

International trade
A large portion of silk production is consumed locally, however, there is signiﬁcant trade in intermediates
with cocoons exported to producers of silk yarn, silk yarn exported to produce of silk textiles and silk textiles
exported to producers of silk garments. Even countries such as India, which produce the full range from cocoons
to garments, import a signiﬁcant level of intermediate goods. Most large producers of silk textiles, with the
notable exception of China, import silk yarn. Countries such as Thailand and India do so in order to supplement
their own production.42

   The global trade in silk can be divided into four categories: cocoons, raw silk, silk textiles, and ﬁnished
   silk products. The growth in trade of the ﬁrst two categories is shown in Figures 37 and 38. In the last ten
   years, trade in silk yarn has ﬂuctuated between 10,000 and 16,000 tons with values between US$240 and
   US$390 million.

   The trade in silk textiles grew rapidly up until the global ﬁnancial crisis but appears to be recovering as shown
   in Figure 39. The trade in silk apparel has grown along with the growth in apparel but at a slower rate due to
   limitations on supply. Sill textiles and apparels remain a luxury good and account for a very small portion of
   the global trade.

   The largest exporter of silk yarn and silk products is China, which accounted for more than half of the trade in
   2010. China remains he leading source of silk yarn, but is increasing its exports of ﬁnished products. The next
   largest exporters are Italy and India, accounting for roughly 11 percent and 10 percent by value, respectively.43
   Cambodia has a minimal market share of silk trade, less than 0.05 percent.

   Cambodia’s trade in silk products increased from US$2.2 million in 2001 to US$3.2 million in 2010, (Figure 40).
   In reached a record-high of US$3.5 million in 2009, but has since declined due to the current sovereign debt/
   Euro crisis.

Production process
The silk production process is complex and involves a diverse set of activitie (Figure 41). The production
cycle can be divided into sericulture, production and distribution. The former represents the inbound supply
chain that delivers silk yarn for weaving. Production refers to weaving and the manufacture of textiles
and garments. Distribution refers to the outbound supply chain and includes marketing and can include
downstream value addition.

The activities in the inbound supply chain are shown in the diagram below. It begins with the production of
cocoon and the reeling of silk yarn. There are three types of silkworms commonly used for producing cocoons.

Native mulberry silkworms are traditionally produced by farmers and are based on egg stocks that are
maintained by the farmers themselves. The native silkworms offer low cost and greater disease tolerance but
have lower yields than other varieties. These are used by small-scale farmers to supplement their income.

   Foreign hybrids (bivoltine) produce larger, usually white cocoons that can be reeled in factories. The eggs can
   usually be hatched at any time. Their silk ﬁlament can be as long as 1500 meters and therefore has a high
   yield that provides quick return. However, the eggs are expensive and are more susceptible to diseases so that
   breeders must be trained in their use. These hybrids are promoted by private companies and used by medium-
   sized farmers who breed silkworms commercially.

       The primary inputs to the production of the cocoons are the silkworm larvae and the mulberry leaves to feed
       the silkworms. Improved varieties that produce many more leaves have been introduced but they require
       improvements in cultivation techniques and irrigation.

       Silkworm cocoons are purchased from the breeders by reelers who produce the yarn. The reeling technology
       depends on the type of silkworms. Traditional and poly-voltine varieties require hand-reeling, while foreign
       bivoltines can be machine-reeled. The difference can be seen both in terms of quality and quantity: hand-
       reeling produces a lower yield of uneven yarn. After reeling, the silk de-gummed, bleached and dyed. Traders at
       the village level act as a middlemen between reelers and dyers in their village or within short proximity of their
       village. Provincial and district traders then sell the yarn to weavers.

       The production of fabric and garments is organized as a traditional cottage industry or as a small scale
       commercial activity. For the former, the breeders reel their cocoons, weave the yarn ad produce silk fabrics,
       usually on handlooms. This type of arrangement is maintained in relatively few countries, speciﬁcally India,
       Thailand, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. For the latter, the breeders sell the cocoons to silk reeling
       factories, which then sell it to weavers either directly or through a trader.

         Bi-volitine refers to silkworks that can have two generations per year. Polyvoltine, also called multivoltine, refers to silkworms that can have more than two
         generations (life cycle) in a year.

The weavers may be individual craftsmen but are more often part of cooperatives or employees of private ﬁrms
manufacturing silk handcrafts. Depending on the silkworm, weaving can be done with traditional handlooms,
modernized handlooms, or semi-automatic looms. Local traders sell the dyed yarn to small producers or a spot
basis while provincial or district traders sell to lager producers under longer-term arrangements. Some of the
larger traders may also be involved in the production of textiles.

From the weavers the silk product goes to garment manufacturers or home textile producers. These have
different levels of involvement in the supply chain. The larger ones generally exert greater control over
the supply chain (starting from the silkworm production), while the smaller ones limit their involvement to
purchasing silk from weavers or traders.

There are several types of products that can be made from silk or silk blends including home textiles and
interior decorations, fashion garments and accessories, and both modern and traditional garments. These are
sold primarily in medium and high value markets. The principal distribution channels are local stores and hotels
that cater to tourists, Internet sales and foreign boutique outlets and small chains.

       from the frame and each yarn is subsequently

Cambodia’s silk industry
Cambodia participates in all three activities of the silk trade. At present there are about 1300 breeders and
160 hectares of mulberry trees that produce approximately 5 metric tons of silk yarn per year. This is
considerably less than the 50 metric tons produced during the 1950s. The loss in production is due in large part
to low productivity in silk production and higher returns from other crops. However, the number of breeders has
increased slightly in recent years are shown in Figure 42.

           Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
112        An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
The region most suitable for mulberry tree cultivation is in the northwestern region in Oddar Meanchey and
Preah Vihear provinces and in the eastern region in Prey Veng, Kampong Cham, Kratie, Stung Treng, Rattanakiri,
and Mondulkiri provinces. Some mulberry plantations have been established in Banteay Menachey and Siem
Reap provinces.

Production of the yarn is concentrated in the Northwest while the weaving of the yarn takes place in the south
(see map). The total number of weavers is estimated to be between 18,000 and 20,000, most of whom are
concentrated in ﬁve areas: Takeo, Kandal, Kampong Cham, Prey Veng and the Northwest area (Figure 42).
Cambodia produces about 2.4 million sq m of fabric, which requires it to import about 400 metric tons of the
silk yarn. The yarn is sourced from Vietnam with smaller amounts from China and Uzbekistan. Gross output of
the sector is about US$50 million, of which about US$25 million represent the cost of yarn import. Most of the
production is for domestic consumption. Less than 10 percent is exported.

The majority of manufacturers of ﬁnished products are located in Phnom Penh. The sector is dominated by
small producers and NGOs but there are also a number of joint ventures and foreign-owned companies.
Their capacity for design and product and market development is limited.

Thai silk industry45
Most of Thailand’s silk is destined for the domestic market (about 70 percent). The rest is exported and consist
of intermediate products such as silk fabrics and yarns (64 percent of exports) and ﬁnished goods including
garments and accessories (24 percent) and home textiles (12 percent). The value of its exports is around
US$31 million.

Thailand has two silk supply chains, one for polyvoltine (producing multiple generations in a year) and one
for bivoltine (producing two generations per year). These are used to produce hand and machine reeled yarn.
Polyvoltine varieties cannot be machined reeled and are rougher and thicker, whereas bivoltine varieties can
be machine woven. Thailand produces only about 1,400 tons of silk yarn per year. Of this about 1,080 tons are
handicraft production from polyvoltine and poly-bivoltine cocoons, while 320 tons are industrial production
from bivoltine cocoons.

The supply chain for the former starts with the production of cocoons by rearers farmers. The three main
stages of processing, cocoon rearing, yarn reeling and weaving are all performed at the farm level. About
117,000 farmers produce an average of 80kg of cocoons. About 15kg of cocoons produce about 1kg of yarn of
which 60 percent is sold to traders and the remaining 40 percent is degummed and woven into fabric. Thus
the total yarn available for weaving on traditional wooden looms is around 265 tons, which produces about 1.15
million yards of woven fabric or 4.3 yards per kg of yarn. Some 30 percent of this is kept for own consumption
and combined with 180 thousand yards of fabric coming from the poly- bivoltine chain to produce more than
half a million yard yards for domestic consumption. The other 70 percent of fabric produced in the polyvoltine
marketing chain is sold to small fabric traders who also purchase fabric from the poly-bivoltine chains. Half of
the about 1.225 million yards is sold.

The polyvoltine cocoons are reeled by hand and used for weft yarn. Machine reeling is done in factories using
bivoltine cocoons purchased from contract farmers to produce both weft and warp yarn. Most of the weft yard
is produced locally while a signiﬁcant portion of the warp yarn is imported (often smuggled) from China and
Vietnam, The power loom sector dominates the production of fabric in the country, accounting for more than
90 percent of the total fabric production.

       The poly-bivoltine supply chain involves bout 31,500 breeders that produce about 130kg of cocoons per farm
       and sell around 70 percent of their yarn. Most is sold to other farmers who reel weft yarn. Only about 15 percent
       is sold to reeling groups and reeling factories. After degumming their yarn the poly- bivoltine producers have
       around 80 tons of yarn to weave. This is augmented with another 40 tons of yarn purchased from local traders
       and woven to produce about 5 yards of fabric per kilogram of yarn. About two-thirds of the fabric is then is sold
       to small traders.

       The traders combine the fabrics from poly-voltine and voltine silk and sell about half through street vendors
       and the rest through formal retail trade.

       Thailand has also evolved two general business models based on village-level production of the silk yarn.
       One relies on a cooperative and the other on a private ﬁrm to organize the production and sale. The marketing
       channels are similar but with slight differences as shown in Table 10.

            Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:
1 14        An Analysis Using a Trade and Transpor t Facilitation Assessment (T TFA)
Characteristics of ﬁrms surveyed
1. Three small producers of silk garments were interviewed.
2. They import either silk yarn which they weave or cloth which they used to produce garments.

3. They also import chemical dyes as well as some natural dyes primarily from the region.

4. The imported silk and silk yarn is purchased from local wholesalers who deliver the yarn and cloth to the
   factory and are paid cash on delivery.

5. There is a problem with the availability of supply as it varies from month to month and has inconsistent
   quality. However, this does not appear to have a signiﬁcant impact on their ability to fulﬁll orders.

6. They produce scarves, bags, shawls and also fabric for export.

7.   The major markets are developed countries in Europe, North America and East Asia.

8. These products are sold on an FOB basis to foreign wholesalers and retailers.

9. Producers receive a 30-50 percent advance payment at the time of order conﬁrmation.

10. They produce to order except for one small producer who maintains export inventory.

11. Firms vary in terms of mode of shipment with one ﬁrm using only airfreight, another shipping 70 percent
    by air and the third shipping two-thirds by sea.

12. The order cycle can be as little as 1-2 weeks with airfreight but by sea 3 months for distant destinations.

13. The ﬁrm’s principal source of competitive advantage is the uniqueness of their product, the quality and the cost.

14. All 3 ﬁrms are looking to increase the volume of orders as a way to grow their business. For this purpose
    are attempting to improve the quality and diversity of products.

15. The greatest constraint to grow is lack of demand followed by limited working capital, production
    technology and quality control, as well as the availability of labor.

16. The outbound supply chains do not pose any challenges other than the cost of domestic transport.

17. The consumption of inputs is only about 50-100 meters of cloth month, which is delivered within a few
    days by road from the local wholesaler.

18. Deliveries are relatively small and correspond to size of the producers output, nevertheless inputs are
    delivered weekly.

19. Export shipments are relatively small, with 100-700 pieces.

20. The average value of an export shipment is US$2,000-US$10,000 although it can be as small as US$400
    and as large as US$30,000.

21. A forwarder selected by the producer arranges for export shipments, but in certain cases the buyer
    nominates the forwarder.

22. Exports are shipped from the factory in cartons by road with the movement arranged by the forwarder.




                                                                       Improving Trade Competitiveness in Cambodia:

    23. The goods produced are ready for retail.

    24. Two of the three ﬁrms have very few late shipments but 30 percent experience delays due to delays in
        production.

    25. The yarn costs about US$50 per kilogram and the cloth about US$10 per meter based on the spot
        market price.

    26. The inputs are purchased on a cash basis and paid at time of delivery.

    27. The delivery time is generally one-day for fabric and yard but most dyes require up to 15 days.

    28. The producers rely on their own funds to manage their cash ﬂows.

    29. The export sold on a shipment by shipment basis.

    30. Communication with the buyers by e-mail.

    31. Payment for the goods occurs at the time of delivery or one week thereafter and is paid by TT or bank
        transfer.

    32. Letters of credit are not used in this trade.

    33. The cash-to-cash cycle is only about 2 weeks.

    Supply chains and cash ﬂows models
    Three business models were examined. The ﬁrst uses local yarn together with imported yard in its weaving.
    The second uses exclusively low yarn while the third uses exclusively imported yarn. All produce silk
    products for retail and are distributed both locally and internationally.
