Bulgaria
Economic growth is low and fragile (GDP growth in the third quarter was 1.5%; not seasonally adjusted, yoy).
Though strong exports (especially of goods) helped achieve the growth and the current account surplus,
subdued domestic demand led to feeble credit growth, investment, and job creation. Deflationary pressure
could also hinder the economic recovery through weaker demand and higher real interest rate.

      GDP growth strengthened in the third quarter of 2013 to 1.5% (not seasonally adjusted, yoy) (Fig.1),
       supported by net exports and public consumption. On the supply side, the growth was led by
       agriculture, public administration and financial services.
      Exports of goods kept growing, while exports of services lost its momentum in the second half of 2013
       (Fig.2). The growth of goods exports was driven mainly by the exports to the euro zone countries (such
       as Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands) (Fig.3). Food products and investment goods (such as machinery,
       equipment and auto parts) accounted for close to three quarters of total export growth while petroleum
       products, which led exports growth in 2012, decreased as a result of falling oil prices.
      Current account balance (year-to-date) was 2.8% of GDP at the end of November (Fig.4). It is 3.3
       percentage points higher compared to the same period in 2012. Improved goods balance (from -7.9% of
       GDP in 2012 to -4.8% in 2013) contributed most to the current account surplus, while services balance
       slightly decreased (from 5.8% of GDP in 2012 to 5.0% in 2013).
      Industrial production index increased for six months in a row, supported by the favorable industrial sales
       on the external market. However, the index in November 2013 was only 0.5% higher relative to the
       same period of 2012 (Fig.5). Employment was decreasing throughout the third quarter (Fig.6).
      Real labor productivity improved by 1.9% in the third quarter of 2013 compared to that in the second
       quarter. However, it was not sufficient to cover the rise of real unit labor cost in the first and second
       quarters, which was triggered by the increase in the minimum social security income (Fig.7).
      Downward adjustments to administered prices (electricity and heating) and subdued domestic demand
       contributed to deflation; CPI inflation has been negative for five months in a row since August. The year-
       end CPI inflation was -1.6%, much lower than the markets’ consensus forecast. (Fig.8 and 9).
      Total credit growth and that to corporations remained positive, but low due to weak demand (Fig.11).
       Continued and careful monitor will be required on potentially dragging factors for credit growth; such as
       an increase in real interest rate due to negative inflation, deleveraging by foreign-owned banks (Fig.12),
       high non-performing loans ratio (17.2% as of September) (Fig.13), and political instability.

Backed by its sound fiscal management, Bulgaria’s sovereign borrowing cost has been low. With such
financial credibility, Bulgaria managed to raise €290 million in Schuldschein loans to cover the additional
financing needs under its relaxed fiscal stance (Budget deficit targets are 2.0% of GDP in 2013 and 1.8% in
2014). To maintain the favorable sovereign borrowing situation, policies toward economic growth are critical.

      The actual budget deficit in 2013 was estimated at 1.8% of GDP, lower than the revised plan 2% (Fig.14).
       Both revenues and expenditures fell short of expectations. Underperformance on the revenue side

                                                       1
          reflected lower tax revenues collected by the Customs Agency, affected by weak imports and frequent
          management changes in the Agency. While grant revenues (mainly from EU) increased compared to
          2012, they were only 70% of the plan. Lower absorption of EU funds has meant lower than planned
          public investment.
         Bulgaria’s Parliament approved the budget for 2014, in which the deficit target is 1.8% of GDP.
         General government debt to GDP ratio was 16.3% at the end of September, which is well-below the 60%
          threshold under the Stability and Growth Pact (Fig.15).
         Short-term external debt to GDP ratio was decreasing from 26.3% at the end of 2012 to 24.6% in
          November 2013 (Fig.16). It was well-covered with official reserves, which were €13.1 billion as of
          November 2013, at the ratio of 130% (Fig.17).
         Bulgaria’s sovereign borrowing cost has been low and stable (The 10-year government bond yield was
          3.6% on average in 2013) (Fig.18). Under this circumstance, Bulgaria completed the private placement of
          Schuldschein loans with German and Austrian institutional investors to raise €290 million on December
          14th (the mix of 7-year, 10-year, and 15-year bonds).
         Bulgaria has also been weathering well the recent emerging market volatility thanks to its strong anchor
          to Europe and strong fiscal position. The bond yields and CDS spreads remain stable, while Hungary,
          Romania, and Poland faced a sharp rise in their bond yields (by 40-75 bps in 10-year bonds and by 61-87
          bps in 3-year bonds) in the second half of January 2014 (Fig.18-20).
         On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Bulgaria’s outlook on December 13th from “stable”
          to “negative” based on its low economic growth, high unemployment and political uncertainty, even
          though the long-term sovereign credit ratings still remain BBB (within investment grade).

                               Growth-enhancing fiscal policies and business environment reforms are
                                        key to accelerated, sustainable economic growth.
