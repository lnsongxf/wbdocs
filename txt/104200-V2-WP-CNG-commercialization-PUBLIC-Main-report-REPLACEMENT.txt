        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
        The study has analysed current Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) technology for its
        potential to monetise small volumes of this gas (1-15MMscf/d) and avoid or reduce
        the gas flaring.



Introduction
        Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is natural gas transported and stored in compressed
        form (pressurised to between 100 and 250 barg) in order to reduce the volume to be
        transported or stored by between 150 to 300 times that of gas at atmospheric
        pressure.
        Historically, CNG has been used onshore for gas supply over short distances and in
        relatively small volumes. While the cost of delivered CNG depends on project
        specific conditions such as gas volume, in general CNG can be economically viable
        for volumes up to around 5 MMscf/d and distances up to 800 km.
        Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is mainly used as an alternative fuel for vehicles.
        Natural gas vehicles are very popular worldwide, particularly in countries such
        Pakistan, Argentina, India and China. Use of CNG as fuel for road vehicles has been
        driven by two main factors: rising gasoline prices and increased environmental
        concerns.
        Use of CNG at a larger scale is not yet commercially viable but is being investigated
        by several companies as a potential economically viable alternative to Liquefied
        Natural Gas (LNG).



The CNG Chain
        The CNG chain is composed of four elements: Production, Transportation,
        Receiving and Storage.


 Production
        CNG production consists of gas pre-treatment and compression. The pre-treatment
        process is simpler than in an LNG liquefaction plant and is generally set by the
        requirements of the end users. The main pre-treatment activities are:
              Removal of heavy hydrocarbons to avoid condensation when storing as CNG,
              removal of contaminates: hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, etc., and
              dehydration.

        The amount of compression required depends on the delivery pressure of the source
        gas reservoir and gas quality.

Transportation
      CNG may be transported on-shore or off-shore (marine). There are a number of
      different options available for each alternative.

      Marine CNG Transportation
      Transportation cost is the most important factor in the CNG chain. The cost of CNG
      marine transport is directly proportional to the volume of gas and distance between
      the gas source and the consumers.
      Since the early 1960’s the marine transport of CNG has been investigated and
      analysed by various developers. The current marine CNG developers and their
      transportation concepts are as follows:

      On-shore CNG Transportation
      On-shore CNG transportation is a proven technology that has been used for decades.
      The on-shore CNG transportation system consists of:
         gas compression and truck loading at the gas source location;
         truck offloading, heating, let-down and metering at the customer site.

      Analysis of the cost of delivered CNG for a number of volumes and distances (see
      below) shows that, for production capacities higher than 5 MMscf/d, delivery of
      CNG by truck becomes difficult not only due to the substantial number of vehicles
      required (especially for longer distances), but also the significant extent of loading
      and offloading facilities required.
      The CNG storage type used for transportation is the main difference between the
      various suppliers. The main characteristics are as follows:

Examples of CNG chain costs
      The sizing and cost of the different elements of the chain depend on the specific
      characteristics of each project such as: gas volume and composition, distance to
      consumers, storage and infrastructure requirements, geographical location etc.
      The unit cost (capital and operating) for four scenarios have been evaluated: Gas
      volumes of 3 and 10 MMscf/d, and short and long distances to customers. It must be
      noted that these cost estimates are only indicative as specific circumstances (e.g. a
      challenging physical environment, high labour costs in an overheated business
      environment such as the Bakken in N. Dakota), can affect the costs and hence
      economics significantly.

CNG market overview
       Onshore
       There are currently almost 20 million road vehicles in the world in a wide range of
       countries using CNG as fuel. The ten countries with the largest CNG vehicle fleets
       (in millions) are:
              Rank                Country                     Registered fleet            Rank                    Country                    Registered fleet

       The fast growth of CNG as fuel for vehicles has been to a large extent driven by
       government subsidies and initiatives to promote conversion to CNG for
       environmental and economic reasons.
       Other uses of CNG, such as for power generation; industrial consumers etc., are
       currently less developed mainly because the gas volumes required are often too high
       for truck distribution.

       Offshore
       The lack of proven commercial options for marine transportation of CNG is the
       main obstacle to faster business development in these areas.
       Indonesia may become the first-mover in marine transportation of CNG. A 2,200m³
       CNG carrier is currently being built to supply gas to a CNG storage facility in
       Lombok. The project is planned to start commercial operations in 2016.

Conclusions
       CNG on-shore transportation is well established in a number of countries since the
       1990s. Marine CNG transportation, however, is still under development and with no
       units yet in commercial operation.
       While the cost of delivered CNG depends on project specific conditions such as gas
       volume and composition, in general:
           On-shore delivered CNG can be economically viable for volumes up to
              around 5 MMscf/d and distances up to around 500 miles (800 km).
           Marine CNG is not yet commercially proven but could be economically
              viable for large volumes and distances up to around 2000 nautical miles.

1.    INTRODUCTION
      Pressurising Natural Gas and sending it into pipeline network systems is the major
      means of transporting natural gas, especially for onshore purposes. Long distances
      pipelines together with compressor stations distributed along the pipeline route
      transport the gas from the producing area to consumers.
      However, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) used as an alternative fuel for vehicle is
      now popular worldwide and the twenty-first century has seen an important growth in
      onshore bulk transportation and infrastructure for delivery and distribution of natural
      gas at vehicle refuelling stations.
      At the same time, several marine CNG transport technologies have been developed
      for short-distance transportation of small volumes of gas competing with less
      economical LNG solutions. However, despite marine CNG transportation options
      being promising, no project has yet been put into commercial operation.
      This is expected to change in the coming years, influenced by emerging energy
      demand in countries with less developed infrastructure and with the growing
      sensitivity towards environmental impact of higher emission fuels.
      Indeed, the development of economical CNG transportation could be part of the
      possible solutions for the recovery of associated gas as mentioned in the Global Gas
      Flaring Reduction (GGFR) program led by the World Bank.
      The following sections focus on CNG solutions applicable for use with small
      volumes (1-15 MMscf/d) of associated gas in offshore and onshore conditions.
      Before investigating the status of development by the various technology providers
      and their proposed technologies, it might be useful to first describe the issues linked
      to the handling and recovery of associated gas for the purpose of transporting it as
      CNG.

1.2. Constraints for the recovery of associated gas
     as CNG

 1.2.1. Nature of associated gas
        Associated gas is a form of natural gas which is found in association with oil within
        the reservoir and is produced when oil arrives at the surface. Once separated from
        crude oil, raw natural gas usually consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons in various
        proportions, principally ethane, propane, butane, pentanes and small quantities of
        heavier components.

        In addition, raw natural gas contains water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO2), helium,
        nitrogen, sometimes hydrogen sulphide (H2S), and other compounds. Typical
        compositions of associated gas are given as an example in Table 1 but each field and
        sometimes even each well has its own production characteristics and gas
        composition.

       There are different ways to deal with the production of associated gas. Depending on
       the quantities involved, the field location (at sea, on land, remote or not…), and the
       composition of the gas (e.g. some may contain a large proportion of carbon dioxide
       or nitrogen), the gas can be just flared off, re-injected into the reservoir for enhanced
       oil recovery, used as fuel gas on the platform for electricity generation or exported
       by pipeline for further processing or direct injection into gas grids.
       Unfortunately, today associated gas is flared rather than used in many countries and
       contributes to climate change.
       Whatever the destination (except if flared), the gas must be treated and conditioned
       accordingly. This is also the case for its transportation as CNG due to the fact that
       the intent is to recover the gas to burn elsewhere, generally after being injected into
       a gas pipeline.


1.2.2. Constraints linked to CNG transportation
       For economic reasons, CNG transportation especially marine CNG must maximize
       the ratio of the weight of the transported gas to the weight of the containment. This
       implies that the gas should ideally be transported athigh pressure and low
       temperature. Usually, transport pressures range between 100 and 250 barg giving a
       volumetric efficiency (reduction of the volume occupied by the gas at atmospheric
       conditions) of 150 to 300:1 compared to LNG (about 600:1). Some technologies
       also cool the gas to -30oC.
       The amount of gas that can be loaded, equipment required and operating procedures
       depend on several parameters:
          the gas composition,
           the pressure and temperature conditions at the field,
           the production rate of associated gas and thus the filling rate of the marine or
           land transport container,
           the type of CNG container,
          the gas storage conditions (pressure and temperature).
       At the point of delivery, equipment required and operating procedures will depend
       on:
         the pressure and temperature conditions for CNG offloading,
        the possible limitation of the offloading rate,
        the required quality specification for the received gas.

       All these parameters are relevant for CNG solutions at onshore or offshore gas fields
       but the issues are particularly important in case of marine CNG transportation for
       which approval is required by a Certification Society such as Det Norske Veritas
       (DNV).

1.2.3. Gas quality
       As previously mentioned, associated gas is present in various compositions that may
       require the gas to be treated before being stored under pressure for transportation.
       Normally the gas must be dried so that no moisture will form in the container which
       may cause formation of hydrates and corrosion in the presence of carbon dioxide.
       Hydrogen sulphide is not allowed for reasons of corrosion. Furthermore, at the
       reception point, the gas will generally have to meet pipeline quality specifications
       with restrictions on injection temperature, water and hydrocarbon dew points,
       sulphur content and Wobbe index.
       Depending on the composition and on the gas utilisation, the extent of gas
       conditioning required prior to transportation as CNG will be a combination of
       several different processes such as:
          removal of heavy hydrocarbons to avoid condensation when storing CNG,
          removal of contaminates: hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide…,
          dehydration.


       Typical contaminant concentrations in associated or stranded well gas are:
          water vapour:                    1 – 3% (gas is saturated)
          H2S:                             0 – 300 ppm
        CO2:                               0.1 – 10%
        Condensable hydrocarbons:          1 – 1000 ppmv
       For onshore gas pipelines, the requirements for the content of contaminants typically
       are:
          water dew point:                -10°C at 70 barg
        hydrocarbon dew point:            -2°C at 1-70 barg
        H2S:                              maximum 5 mg/m³
        total sulphur:                    max. 30 -50 mg/m³
        CO2                               2-3 % (molar)
       These requirements could be more    severe depending on the loading conditions and
       the gas containment material.


1.2.4. Recovered gas pressure at the production site
       Separation of the oil, water and gas produced in their original phases is achieved by
       a stepwise reduction in pressure (usually one to three separation stages) down to
       nearly atmospheric pressure, flashing off the gas. Associated gas is produced at all
       pressure levels and additional compression equipment may be required to reach the
       required transport pressure..


1.2.5. Stored gas temperature
       The mass of gas stored is a function of the density of the gas. Gas can be carried
       under chilled conditions but this requires appropriate conditioning equipment and
       insulation to avoid over-pressurization of the containment during transportation.


                                      17
       Also, one must take into account the unavoidable warm-up during the loading itself
       resulting from the compression of the gas into the containment especially if the latter
       is insulated. For example, lean gas compressed to 250 barg would increase in
       temperature by 40-50°C. This issue should be carefully addressed when developing
       the operating conditions at the loading point.
       The depressurization of the cargo at the delivery point will have the opposite effect
       i.e. cooling, and this should also be taken into consideration when defining the
       offloading conditions.


1.2.6. Production rate
       Oil production is generally continuous and therefore also the production of
       associated gas. It is generally not acceptable to interrupt the oil production and
       therefore CNG offtake facilities must be able to support continuous operation at the
       field or well gas production rate. However, the volume of gas produced is not
       constant and will also decline overtime. This has a direct impact on the solution to
       be put in place.
       In this report, the production rates considered are:
        minimum 1 MMscf/d corresponding to a hourly mass flowrate of around 1 t/h of
         associated gas (Lean Gas of Table 1),
        maximum 15 MMscf/d corresponding to a hourly mass flowrate of around 14 t/h
         of associated gas (Lean Gas of Table 1).



1.2.7. Offloading Rate
       As for the production rate, the offloading rate may be limited by the end user and
       may be required to be continuous. This has a direct impact on the offloading
       facilities and ship immobilization time (marine CNG) or CNG storage (onshore
       CNG) hence on the whole delivery chain.


1.2.8. Offloading conditions
       Most of the time, the transported gas will be injected into a pipeline connected either
       to a single customer (e.g. a power plant) or to an existing natural gas grid which are
       operated within certain pressure and temperature ranges. This will require heating
       facilities to prevent gas temperatures being too low due to the Joule-Thompson
       cooling when depressurizing the CNG. A scavenging compressor would need to be
       provided as, at some point during the gas offloading, the CNG pressure will be
       insufficient to deliver the gas at the rate and pressure required by the receiving
       pipeline. It will also maximise CNG recovery and reduce the heel pressure, the
       residual pressure in the transport vessel.


1.2.9. Safety
       Transporting large quantities of gas under high pressure raises three major safety
       issues:


                                       18
         Integrity of the containment system: the stored energy of compressed gas is very
         high. For instance, a 30m tall 24” diameter pipe pressurized at 110 barg contains
         the energy equivalent of 120 MJ. Damage from a rupture can result from shock
         waves, flying projectile fragments from the ruptured piping, and unrestrained
         movement of piping and equipment propelled by the escaping gas,
        Integrity of the carrier’s hull: the tremendous weight of the containment system
         results in the transfer of the loads from the CNG containment to the support
         structure, and so must be checked for suitability. It must also be verified that the
         support of the containment system can sustain the loads from the ship movement
         in difficult sea conditions or potential collisions. Furthermore, the impact of an
         accidental leak of the containment system must be fully assessed and the risks
         mitigated by adequate safety measures being implemented throughout the
         lifetime of the transport unit. This requires the possibility to inspect the
         containment system at regular intervals or to provide a continuous monitoring
         system,
        Risk of explosion: The nature of the containment system, which often consists of
         side-by-side assemblies of cylinders, may create a confined space in the ship’s
         holds in which a gas leakage (not necessarily from the cylinders but from the
         manifolds) may create an explosive atmosphere. (N.B.: DNV’s rules require the
         hold space to be inerted with nitrogen or other suitable non corrosive medium).


1.2.10. CNG ship certification
       The development in the early 2000’s of marine CNG alternatives to LNG led the
       classification societies to develop guidelines for both the containment systems and
       CNG carriers. New design criteria and acceptance procedures have been proposed to
       depart from the conventional pressure vessel codes and International Gas Code
       (IGC) which previously made such CNG concepts uneconomic and even practically
       unfeasible.
       The current existing codes and standards are:
          American Bureau of Shipping (ABS): Guide for Vessels Intended to Carry CNG
          in Bulk,
        Det Norske Veritas (DNV): Rules for Classification of Ships – part 5 CNG
          Carriers,
        Bureau Veritas (BV): Rule Note NR 517 – Classification of CNGCarriers.
       Any marine CNG transport design must be approved by one of the classification
       societies.


1.2.11. Container design for marine transport
       The cargo containment system, especially the cargo cylinders (individual pressure
       vessels for storage of CNG) must be proven safe and reliable through the whole
       range of process and mechanical stress conditions, including:
         low temperatures which may occur in case of sudden depressurization including
         the impact on the ship hull (impingement of gas cooled by the Joule-Thompson
         effect),
        high and low temperatures resulting respectively from the gas compression and
         the gas depressurization,
        fatigue induced by the pressure-cycling in the loading and offloading process,
                                      19
           external loads (deadweight, acceleration forces due to ship’s or truck’s
           movement),
         stress corrosion cracking,
         …
        Governing codes applicable for high pressure gas cylinders can be conventional
        codes like ASME VIII div1 but several approaches have been taken to optimize the
        design namely to make more efficient use of material and reduce the weight of the
        cylinders.
        ASME VIII div2 was revised in 2007 in order to promote more competitive design
        and div3, originally developed for design pressures above 10,000 psi (690 bar), in
        2010 incorporated composite wrapped vessels for CNG.
        DNV proposes to design the cylinders using its Standard for Submarine Pipeline
        Systems OS-F101 which, for the X-80 standard pipeline steel, allows a 50%
        reduction in wall thickness of the gas cylinders as compared to the IGC.
        Four types of cargo tanks are differentiated in the ABS’s guidelines:
         Type 1 metallic cylinders with nominal diameter 200 mm (8 ”) or less,
         Type 2 metallic cylinders with nominal diameter above 200 mm (8 ”),
         Type 3 cylinders constructed from composite materials,
         Type 4 cylinders constructed with an inside metal liner and wrapped outside with
          high strength steel wires.
        This classification corresponds the current designs proposed by all the marine
        transportation CNG developers.


1.2.12. Onshore CNG transportation
        Safety of CNG land transport is mainly concerned by the risk off collision hence by
        the integrity and resistance of the containment system.
        Transportation of pressurized gases by road is not new and is well regulated all over
        the world e.g. Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive (TPED) in Europe, U.S.
        Department of Transportation (DOT), the Hazardous Substance Act in Thailand, the
        Canadian TDG Regulations (transport of dangerous goods)… including size and
        weight restrictions for vehicules.




2.      STATUS OF CNG TECHNOLOGIES – MARINE
        CNG
        The concept of marine CNG transport has a long story. A first attempt at
        transporting natural gas under compressed form for commercial purposes was made
        in the 1960’s by Columbia Gas Company of Ohio. The attempt failed mainly
        because the weight of the gas containment designed at that time according to
        International Maritime Organization (IMO) code occupied too large a portion of the
        loading capacity of the vessel. Since then, with the use of advanced pressure vessels
        codes and sometimes non metallic materials (composite), several design have been
        proposed in order to make marine CNG transportation commercially viable.

      Many papers have been published and presented at conferences on the subject. They
      are referenced in appendix 1. Also information found on the website of the
      technology providers has been used for this report. In particular, the Canadian
      Centre for Marine CNG Inc. has, since its establishment in 2003, been an active
      promoter of large-scale marine transportation of CNG by providing technical
      support and testing facilities to companies involved in the development of CNG
      technology for offshore transport of natural gas. The current partners in the Centre
      include CNG technology providers, shipping companies, classification societies,
      natural gas infrastructure providers, offshore technology providers, petroleum
      producers, universities, research organizations and the governments of
      Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.
      The following descriptions reflect the current status of the various technologies
      presently in the market together with considerations regarding their applicability to
      handle small volumes of associated gas in offshore conditions.
      The current proposed concepts for CNG shipping are:
         Compressed Energy Technology AS (CETech),
         EnerSea-VOTRANSTM (Volume Optimized Transport and Storage System),
         Sea NG Corporation – Coselle,
         Trans Canada CNG technologies,
         Knutsen,
         Transocean.



2.1. Compressed Energy Technology AS
      Compressed Energy Technology (CETech) is a company jointly established in 2004
      by Leif Höegh & Co, Statoil and Teekay Shipping. Since June 2009, CETech has
      been a 100% owned subsidiary of Höegh LNG AS.




                                      21
 2.1.1. Technology
           CETech's CNG containment system consists of cylinders built of composite
           material. The cylinder is now in the process of qualification testing in order to
           develop fabrication methodology and determine material selection.

 2.1.2. Marine transport vessels
           CETech has developed two major concepts:
             the CNG Shuttle that is intended to transport either natural gas from a supply
              location to a receiving terminal pipeline, or to transport associated gas from an
              oil producing unit to a receiving/processing terminal,
            the Shuttle Producer which can transport both oil and compressed gas and is
              aimed at fields which require simultaneous production and offtake of oil and
              associated gas.
           The basic idea in the CNG ship design is to separate the CNG storage system from
           the vessel’s hull, the latter being similar to standard oil tankers.

2.1.2.1.   THE CNG SHUTTLE
           The design could take two different configurations:
           1)   design using a vertical cylinder containment arrangement




                                            22
                              Figure 3 Courtesy of CETech

The gas is stored at 150 barg in cylinders of 3 m diameter and 30 m length. The
cylinders are installed vertically in the ship in a supporting frame. No insulation of
the containment system is required due to storage at ambient temperatures.
The stored gas weight per cylinder at operating pressure is 29,000 kg for the lean gas
composition given in Table 1, and 37,500 kg for the rich gas composition. Higher
loading capacities can be achieved by using low storage temperatures (down to
minus 30°C), the cylinders having a design temperature of minus 60°C. However, an
operating procedure is not available and the energy of compression could
compromise achieving such low temperatures. Should it be possible, then insulation
would be required to maintain the gas in its initial storage conditions during the
ships voyage.
No transportation capacity has been communicated by CETech. If we assumed the
cylinders were to be installed in standard oil tankers, 250 to 500 MMscf could be
transported.
Therefore the maximum daily production of associated gas considered in this study
could be stored in just 10 cylinders which would represent a small portion of the
total ship storage capacity.




                              Figure 4 Courtesy of CETech




                               23
           The ship is provided with a cargo compartment that contains a heating system for
           use during gas offloading and also has a small gas processing unit that may be
           required by the gas conditions at the loading location. In that respect, liquids that are
           separated from the gas can be stored in dedicated tanks or, says CETech, “ be spiked
           into the tanks together with the gas”.It is not clear how the liquid would be
           recovered at the delivery side.
           2)   Design using a horizontal pipe system




                                          Figure 5 Courtesy of CETech



           This CNG containment system consists of stacked layers of 200 m long horizontal
           pipes mounted within and on the ship’s deck. The pipes, made of high strength X-80
           steel, are 1.2 m diameter with a wall thickness of about 36 mm.
           The proposed ship would contain a total of 510 pipes with a total volume of about
           120,000 m³. The gas will be stored at a high pressure of 250 barg which gives a ship
           transport capacity in the range of 30 to 35 million standard cubic metres (1,000 to
           1,200 MMscf).
           CETech claims to have been looking at CNG Shuttles with horizontal pipe system
           having gas transportation capacities of 300 to 1,200 MMscf to be considered when
           compared with the maximum production rate of 15 MMscf/ d for this study.
           The ship can be equipped with processing facilities so that it can accommodate gas
           from a production platform or directly from seabed facilities via a connecting buoy.
           At destination, both alternatives may be contemplated (jetty or buoy).

2.1.2.2.   THE SHUTTLE PRODUCER
           The concept is a very versatile solution aimed at collecting simultaneous production
           and off-take of oil and gas in several configurations, the objective being floating
           production units with a minimum of process equipment onboard. It could be
           applicable for:
            transport of un-stabilized crude oil to an onshore processing plant,
            intermittent or continuous production and storage of oil and gas depending on the
             reservoir characteristics,
            stationary at well with offshore transfer service,
            connection to a production platform, or directly to seabed facilities via a
             connecting buoy.

                                              tankers (Courtesy of CETech)

           The Shuttle Producer will use the hull of conventional oil tankers with horizontal
           gas pipes as previously described mounted above the oil tanks. The design considers
           two sizes of vessels:
           1) one based on Aframax vessels
           The ship would be able to carry 60 to 70,000 m³ of oil and 8,000 m³ of gas.
           Assuming a pipe length of about 145 m for a Aframax with a length of 245 m
           (length between perpendiculars (LPP)) and a breadth of 44 m, 48 pipes would be
           required to achieve a volume capacity of 8,000 m³ giving a transportation capacity
           of around 80-85 MMscf at 250 barg.
           2) one based on Suezmax vessels
           The ship would be able to carry 120,000 m³ of oil and 30,000 m³ of gas.
           Assuming a pipe length of about 200 m for a Suezmax with a length of 285 m (LPP)
           and a breadth of 48 m, 130 pipes would be required to achieve a volume capacity of
           30,000 m³ giving a transportation capacity of around 300-320 MMscf at 250 barg.

2.1.2.3.   CONTAINERIZED SOLUTION
           In addition to the development of marine CNG carriers, CETech has entered into a
           cooperation agreement with Hexagon Lincoln (Lincoln, Nebraska, USA), a wholly
           owned subsidiary of Hexagon Composites (Ålesund, Norway),for the utilization of
           their TITAN compressed natural gas modules to serve as mobile pipelines for
           marine CNG applications.
           According to Hexagon Lincoln, the design of the TITAN gas cylinder is based upon
           Lincoln Composites' TUFFSHELL® technology. It has a high density polyethylene
           (HDPE) liner, a filament wound carbon fibre/epoxy composite shell (the primary
           structural member of the container), plus a polyurethane coating applied to the outer
           surface. The composite cylinders weigh 75 percent less than equivalent steel tubes.
           The TITANTM4 Module is a 40 ft ISO 1496 certified shipping container which
           contains four TITAN cylinders. Each cylinder is almost 12 m in length and over 1 m
           in diameter and is designed to operate at 250 barg. In these conditions, one module
           can contain 7 to 8,000 kg of CNG or about 0.36 MMscf with a module tare weight
           of 15,649 kg.

                                               25
        Therefore 3 to 42 TITANTM4 Modules could respectively store the daily associated
        gas production range of this study namely 1 to 15 MMscf.
        CETech has presented the conversion of an existing vessel using seven blocks of 21
        containers each for a total transportation capacity of about 50 MMscf at 250 barg.
        This containerized solution would enable more or less tailor-made conversions of
        available ships into ship-containers. However we would expect that such a
        configuration would require a very dense piping and valves system.

2.1.3. Certification
        CETech’s CNG Shuttle concept has received Approval in Principle from
        classification society DNV.
        The ISO container module is ABS approved for onshore and marine CNG
        transportation.


2.1.4. Key features and Comparison LNG
        A summary of the CETech CNG systems is given below compared with the same
        volume of LNG expressed as energy content (btu/btu).
        For the cargo/containment weight ratio, only the weight of the gas container is

2.1.6. Targeted Markets
       CETech considers that CNG is expected to be profitable within a transport range of
       300 (production volume 18,000 MMscf/y) to 2,000 nautical miles (production
       volume of 100,000 MMscf/ y).


2.1.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
       Considering the range of possibilities proposed by CETech, a tailor-made CNG
       chain could be developed to fit demand either with the Aframax type Shuttle
       Producer or with the container vessel using TITAN 4 modules depending on the
       characteristics of the oil reservoir.



2.2. EnerSea – VOTRANSTM
       EnerSea Transport LLC is a company founded in 2001 in partnership with, among
       others, the shipping company Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (“K” Line) and the ship
       builder Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (HHI). The company has developed a CNG
       marine transport system named VOTRANSTM


2.2.1. Technology
       VOTRANSTM technology intends to address several issues relating to the transport
       of gas under high pressure i.e.:
       1)    by optimizing the gas cargo/containment weight ratio,
       2)    by avoiding pressure transient conditions when loading the gas,
       3)    by minimizing the heel pressure so increasing the net CNG transport capacity.




                                           27
2.2.1.1.   GAS CARGO/CONTAINMENT WEIGHT RATIO
           For a non-perfect gas, the pressure, volume and temperature are related by the
           expression PV = zRT, where R is a constant and z is the compressibility factor.
           Depending on the gas composition, the VOTRANSTM system is designed to operate
           at or near the minimum compressibility factor Z for the gas. One may observe on the
           figure below that, for a given gas temperature, the Z factor reaches a minimum for
           an associated pressure which tends to decrease with temperature.




                    Figure 8 Z compressibility factor as function of pressure at constant temperature
                                                 (Courtesy of EnerSea)

           A temperature/pressure pairing can be chosen so that the mass of CNG is maximized
           with respect to the weight of the containment, the latter being proportional to the
           stored gas pressure.
           With the VOTRANSTM system, the gas is compressed and cooled prior to being
           loaded into the ship containment system. EnerSea mentions that typical stored
           conditions can be 125 barg and -30°C.
           The benefit of this compared to other systems operating at higher pressures and
           ambient temperatures is to reduce the containment cost by using a lower storage
           pressure (more or less half the pressure), thereby allowing thinner walled cylinders,
           while keeping a relatively high gas transportation capacity.

2.2.1.2.   DISPLACEMENT FLUID
           EnerSea uses a patented liquid displacement system to handle the gas during loading
           and offloading operations. EnerSea’s CNG cargo containment system consists of
           several sets of storage cylinders configured into multiple tanks and tiers (two or
           more tanks configured to load and offload together).




                                               28
                            Figure 9 VOTRANS CNG Tank Module (Courtesy EnerSea)

           After compression and chilling, the gas flows into the ship containment system
           against a pressurized ethylene glycol/water solution. Gas loading proceeds
           progressively from one module of cylinders to the next, so cascading the
           glycol/water solution ahead of it. When all the modules are filled with gas, the
           glycol solution is stored in an insulated dedicated tank onboard the ship. The
           required inventory for the ethlyne glycol/water solution is 8-10% of the total
           containment system capacity.
           At the delivery side, the same method is applied in reverse by pushing the gas out
           with the pumped glycol solution. The VOTRANSTM system has several advantages:
              the gas handling is performed in constant conditions avoiding the transient
               situations that require gas conditioning and close control during operations. The
               gas can be maintained in dense phase all through the loading and unloading
               operations,
              according to EnerSea, the system with gas kept in a dense phase can
               accommodate a wide range of gas compositions, including rich and associated
               gas,
              gas offloading rate is easily controlled by the glycol/water pumps that may
               deliver high rates if required,
              the displacement fluid piston prevents gas auto-cooling in the cylinders during
               offloading, again allowing high offloading rates,
              low cost for liquid pumping compared with the higher Opex of a scavenging gas
               compression system needed for CNG offloading using a blowdown method.

2.2.1.3.   HEEL PRESSURE
           The use of a displacement fluid allows for lower residual gas volumes (2-5%),
           against 10-15% for conventional high pressure blowdown systems.




                                           29
 2.2.2. Marine transport vessels

2.2.2.1.   CNG VESSEL
           The engineering program, concluded with “K” Line and HHI, has resulted in the
           design and general specification of a vessel targeted to carry 700 MMscf of lean gas.
           The vessel is a 75,000 m³ compressed natural gas carrier. The design utilizes vertical
           cylinders with all manifold connections at the top of the tanks. The cargo
           containment consists of one hundred cylinder modules, each comprised twenty-four
           1,100 mm diameter cylinders with a length of about 39 m (cylindrical part). The
           cylinders are constructed from API 5L X80 grade carbon steel and have a 19mm
           wall thickness for the 125 barg design pressure. The modules are grouped in twelve
           separate holds which are inerted with nitrogen to enhance safety.
           The interior of the cargo spaces is insulated by polyurethane foam (PUF) in order to
           maintain the low temperature of the stored gas and avoid over-pressurization of the
           cylinders due to heat ingress. The tank modules sit upon a denser layer of foam
           material that can support their weight.
           The cargo handling system is located forward of the cargo block. Internal submerged
           turret loading/offloading has been incorporated into the design so that the process
           handling system is well away from the accommodation block. The concept can
           accommodate loading/unloading at jetty or buoy systems as well as uninterrupted
           loading or delivery.
           By optimizing the pressure/temperature combination for the two gas compositions
           given as example in §1.1, the VOTRANSTM V800 class vessel would have a gas
           transport capacity as follows:

EnerSea has developed a range of vessel size classes, including the V600 and V1000
for smaller and larger transport needs respectively, in order to offer a wider option
range adaptable to specific project requirements. A horizontal pipe configuration
could also be contemplated.

2.2.2.2.   BARGE CONCEPT
           EnerSea’s CNG barge system, using the same VOTRANS™ technology, provides
           solutions for gas delivery needs in the range of <10 MMscf/d to over 100 MMscf/d
           over transit distances ranging from 50 to 75 miles.
           The barge-based system can employ an articulated tug-barge design (ATB), wherein
           the tug is coupled directly to the barge. The ATB will provide for better speed,
           efficiency and maneuverability in the open seas than towed barges, which results in
           a low-cost service.

2.2.2.3.   GAS PRODUCTION STORAGE AND SHUTTLE
           Additionally, EnerSea claim that its technology can be used for gas production and
           transport using its Gas Production Storage and Shuttle (GPSS™) system. The
           GPSS™ eliminates a separate Floating Production Unit (FPU) and long pipelines in
           any type of environment, including remote, deepwater and arctic areas. The GPSS™
           system consists of a fleet of CNG ships, each having raw gas production and gas
           handling facilities onboard to condition the water-saturated produced fluids,
           including gas/water separation. The gas is then compressed (if required), chilled and
           stored in gas containment holds, while the extracted water is treated and discharged.
           Any natural gas liquids (NGLs) are stored as un-stabilized liquid in pressure vessels
           similar to those designed for CNG.

       ABS granted ‘Approval in Principle’ for the design and operating plans for the V -
       800 VOTRANS™ ship in 2003.
       ABS has confirmed that EnerSea’s CNG barge design is within the Approval in
       Principle certification that was granted to EnerSea’s VOTRANS™ CNG ship
       system.

2.2.6. Targeted Markets
       The figure below illustrates the expected economic rate/range relationship for the
       current VOTRANS™ fleet of gas carriers.
       One may see that the VOTRANS system targets to support production rates of
       between 150 and 700 MMscf/d (54,000 to 255,000 MMscf/y) depending on distance
       that ranges between 250 and 3,000 nautical miles.
       However the development of system on barges and smaller ship design (horizontal
       pipes) would allow covering coasting trade and smaller yearly production rates.

                                                  EnerSea)



       The VOTRANS™ barge would be competitive between 50 and 750 nautical miles.


2.2.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
       Considering the number and size, VOTRANSTM CNG systems can be scaled to fit
       demand and would depend on daily production rates from the reservoirs.
       The barge system could be more appropriate for the small production range
       considered in this report, provided that the production platform is equipped with gas
       treatment and compression facilities.
       The GPSS™ system contemplated by EnerSea, appears to specifically target
       gas/condensate reservoirs (non-associated gas) and not gas associated with oil
       production.



2.3. Sea NG COSELLETM
       Sea NG Corporation is a Canadian company engaged in the development and
       commercialization of technology for marine transportation of CNG. Sea NG has
       formed an alliance with Marubeni Corporation, Teekay Corporation and Enbridge
       Inc. to jointly develop marine CNG projects, (Sea NG Alliance). The Sea NG
       Alliance will finance, build and own ships utilizing the Coselle™ technology.


2.3.1. Technology
       Sea NG was formed in 2005 to acquire the rights to an innovative marine CNG
       technology -- the Coselle™ invented by Cran & Stenning. The Coselle™ is a large-
       volume, high-pressure gas storage module. Coselle™ is a contraction of the words
       “coiled pipe in a carousel”.

                                         34
       The central idea behind the Coselle™ concept is to create a large CNG storage
       system that overcomes the issues resulting from the utilization of large diameter
       pressure cylinders or pipe sections namely:
         the severe strength requirements for a CNG cargo container design that must
          meet the following limit states (ABS technical paper) : bursting, local buckling
          and collapse, fracture, fatigue, out-of-roundness and corrosion. This is all more
          challenging with large diameter containers,
        Marine CNG containment requires fabrication and installation ofa large number
          of pressure vessels that could create upward pressure on manufacturing costs and
          production delays,
        the large number of pressure vessels to be manifolded together makes the system
          complex with numerous valves, connecting pipes, flanges and fittings which are
          potential sources of leakage,
        configuration of the pressurized gas containment must accommodate regular
          inspections requiring access to each of the components.
       In that respect, the Coselle™ system appears to respond to all the aforementioned
       issues. Its innovative design consists of a large coil of pipe wound into a cylindrical
       storage container. Up to ten miles of conventional six-inch, ¼” wall, high-strength
       X70 line-pipe is coiled into a reel-like structure, called a carousel. The carousel
       provides support and protection for the transportation and stacking of Coselles™.
       Inspection can easily be performed with an intelligent pig device.
       The size of a Coselle™ ranges from 15 to 20 metres in diameter and 2.5 to 4.5
       metres in height and can weigh 550 tonnes. A single Coselle™ carries about 3.0
       MMscf of natural gas, depending on Coselle™ dimensions, and gas temperature,
       pressure and composition. By design, fewer Coselles™ are required for a given
       transportation capacity hence reducing the complexity of the manifolds.
       For the Lean Gas composition given in §1.1, a loaded capacity of 2.7 MMscf can be
       achieved with 213 barg (3,087 psig) and 25°C but 4.3 MMscf if the pressure is
       increased to 266 barg (3,860 psig).

2.3.2. Marine transport vessels
       Coselle™ CNG carriers are essentially bulk carriers with Coselles™ installed in
       their holds. Sea NG developed the standard Coselle™ CNG carrier around a double-
       hulled 60,000-dwt Panamax bulk carrier. In this design, Coselles™ are carried in
       stacks of six high within the ship’s holds.

In total there are 18 stacks of Coselles™ and 108 Coselles™ per ship. Each
Coselle™ holding 3.0 MMscf of CNG, the ship’s transportation capacity is
323 MMscf.
For safety the holds are inerted with nitrogen in order to eliminate the danger of fire
below the deck. All valves and fittings are installed above deck to facilitate
servicing.

The CoselleTM ship may be subject to multiple design variations for different project
applications. The table below gives an idea of the possible ship characteristics. It is
noteworthy that the announced net gas capacities are related to load pressures of
275 barg.

For smaller volume and/or distance projects, it would be possible to mount the
Coselles™ onto a barge. An articulated tug barge unit was designed by Sea NG that
carries 80 MMscf of gas in 28 Coselles™, stacked two high on deck.

        A summary of the Coselle™ C16 and C108 class ship are given below compared
        with the same volume of LNG expressed as energy content (btu/btu).
        For the cargo/containment weight ratio, only the weight of the gas container is
        considered without piping, valves and supporting frame, keeping in mind that the
        Coselle™ ship contains fewer valves and fittings and thus the gas cargo/total
        deadweight ratio could actually be better. The gas cargo is calculated for the Lean
        gas composition given in §1.1 with loaded pressure and temperature of respectively
        266 barg and 25°C.

2.3.4. Certification
        The Coselle™ design and prototype was fully approved by ABS and DNV at an
        operating pressure of 275 barg (4000 psi).
        ABS granted ‘Approval in Principle’ for the design and operating plans for the C16
        Coselle™ ship in 2009.


2.3.5. Commercial references
        None.


2.3.6. Targeted Markets
        Sea NG says that the Coselle™ CNG technology has the potential to be the least
        cost gas-delivery system when the market is less than 2,500 miles from the gas
        source. Sea NG adds that CNG is potentially significantly less costly (combined
        tariff capex+opex) than LNG or pipelines when the transport distance is between
        300 and 1 500 miles.
        The production range, based on Sea NG available information, should be between
        20,000 and 120,000 MMscf/ydepending on the distance.


2.3.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
        The lower limit of the production range corresponds to a daily production of
        65 MMscf.
        On that basis, time to fill a Coselle™ C16 class ship would range between 65 and 4
        days as a function of the production rate. The long immobilization period for the
        ship could adversely impact the project economics.

2.4. TransCanada CNG Technologies
       TransCanada CNG Technologies Ltd is a subsidiary of TransCanada Corporation
       Overseas which is a natural gas pipelines operator and power producer in Canada. In
       2006, TransCanada entered into a strategic partnership with Overseas Shipholding
       Group, Inc. (OSG) to commercialize new technology for CNG transportation.
       Under the agreement, OSG would own and operate a new type of vessel, capable of
       moving large quantities of CNG. The ships would utilize TransCanada's patented
       technology for the design, construction and operation of Gas Transport Modules
       (GTMs) for the storage of the CNG.
       The partners worked under their joint venture TransCNG International (TCI). The
       present status of this joint venture, as well as TransCanada’s continued interest in
       marine CNG, is not clear. A press article (TradeWinds Oct2010) mentioned that
       TransCanada had the intention to sell its CNG transport system, including the
       company’s license to build its patented composite reinforced pressure vessel for
       marine use. Nothing has been publicly revealed about anyactions taken after that
       decision. Nevertheless, a description of the technology is given below as the GTM
       module may present some advantages.


 2.4.1. Technology
       TransCanada's technology is entirely based on the utilization of a proprietary
       composite reinforced steel pressure container system manufactured under license
       from NCF Industries Inc.
       The Gas Transport Module (GTM) is a steel welded pressure vessel wrapped
       circumferentially on its exterior surface with composite layer reinforcement. The
       patented manufacturing process is made in such a way that the composite
       reinforcement produces lower hoop stresses in the steel shell at operating pressures.
       Typically, according to NCF, the composite reinforcement adds 20% to the weight
       of the vessel while increasing the pressure capability by 100%. AGTM module has
       40% less weight per volume compared to steel built to the same standards.




                                   Figure 20 (Courtesy TransCanada)




                                      39
       TransCanada awarded a manufacturing license to the Floating Pipeline Company
       which developed the GTM modules. The GTM module has been designed in 24 or
       30 meters length with a diameter of 1 meter (40 ’’) and a service pressure of
       206 barg (3,000 psi). Each has a storage capacity of 0.2 MMscf of natural gas.


2.4.2. Marine transport vessels
       TransCanada's concept was initially intended to be used for small ships or barges
       with a cargo capacity range from 35 to 100 MMscf;TransCanada also claim to have
       developed in-house models that would envisage vessels carrying between 500 and
       8,000 GTMs representing a gas transportation capacity between 100 and
       1,600 MMscf.
       The figure below partially shows how the 24 m GTMs are placed longitudinally in
       the vessel’s holds and manifolded together.




                      Figure 21 CNG Ship mounted modules (Courtesy TransCanada)



       In the shallow-draught carrier (left-hand) picture below, the GTM modules appears
       to have been assembled in six stacked layers each comprising ten elements. The
       overall dimensions of such assembly of modules would be of approximately 25 (l) x
       15 (w) x 9(h) meters. The cargo content of one assembly would be of 12 MMscf.

                    Figure 22 Shallow-draught carrier Barge concept (Courtesy TransCanada)



       The barge as drawn on the above (righthand) picture appears to contain two
       assemblies of 6x6 GTM modules which correspond to a cargo transportation
       capacity of two times 7 MMscf.


2.4.3. Key features and Comparison LNG
       A summary of TransCanada GTM system is given below compared with the same
       volume of LNG expressed as energy content (btu/btu).
       For the cargo/containment weight ratio, only the weight of the gas container is
       considered without piping, valves and supporting frame. The gas cargo is calculated
       for the Lean gas composition given in §1.1 with loaded pressure and temperature of
       respectively 207 barg and 25°C. Calculation is also made for a Tug/Barge design
       with the same loading conditions.

       TransCanada received Approval in Principle for ocean going vessels from Lloyds
       Register in 2003. The cylinders or Gas Transport Modules (GTMs), developed by
       NCF, which would contain the gas, have already been fully approved.

       Conditional approval for inland barge use has been received from ABS.

2.4.6. Targeted Markets
       TransCanada has made a first assessment using the ‘rule of thumb’ graph below to
       determine if CNG could provide a reasonable transport solution. One can see that
       the targeted market is for low volumes (<200 MMscf/d) and short distances (<500
       nautical mile).




                                   Figure 23 (Courtesy TransCanada)



2.4.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
       The considered associated gas production is within the range targeted by
       TransCanada, provided the distance between the gas source and the delivery location
       remains below 500 nautical miles.
       The proposed solution would be a tug/barge system with possible various tug/barge
       combinations and sizes depending on the specification of the project.
       However, the GTM concept as a whole only addresses one important facet of the
       problem (the storage and transport). The gas conditioning, loading and offloading
       issues are set aside and assumed to be handled by the producer and the customer
       respectively. No gas handling facilities are provided on the tug/barge system as
       shown below on the typical process schematic.

2.5. Knutsen OAS Shipping AS
       Knutsen OAS Shipping AS has developed its CNG system with the assistance of the
       ship classification society DNV and the steel pipe manufacturer Europipe GmBH.

       ‘PNG®’ for Pressurized Natural Gas, is Knutsen OAS Shipping's registered Trade
       Mark for their CNG concept.


 2.5.1. Technology
       The main principle on which the concept was developed is to apply high pressure
       gas pipeline standards to the design of CNG cylinders.More specifically apply the
       DNV standard, DNV-OS-F101- Submarine Pipeline Systems which is in line with
       the evolution of the construction codes for very high pressure vessels.

       Firstly, a risk based approach (QRA) according to IMO code MSC 72/16 is used to
       address the cargo containment hazards of the Knutsen PNG ship.

       The acceptance criteria for the development of PNG® cylinders were in accordance
       with the following DNV standard requirements:

         proper selection of the pipe material (for the PNG®, grade X80 line pipe);
        application of failure mode analysis considering burst and fatigue design criteria;
        full scale testing such as fatigue tests, burst test, cooldown, verification, crack
          propagation analysis due to cooldown or cold spots resulting from an accidental
          gas leak…this to be undertaken on the basis of Probabilistic Limit State Design
          Criteria.
       Observance of these design principles has enabled the PNG® concept to reduce the
       steel weight by 50% from what would have been required by the IGC.

       The main characteristics of the PNG® Cargo Tank Cylinder (CTC) are illustrated
       below.

2.5.2. Marine transport vessels
       Knutsen OAS Shipping has developed two different types of vessel:
         an offshore loading and discharging type PNG® vessel,
        a terminal-to-terminal type PNG® vessel.
       The PNG® ship is a combination of an ordinary crude oil tanker and a CNG
       container ship.

       The offshore loading type vessel can apply a submerged turret loading (STL) system
       from advanced production and loading (APL) systems for gas, while other types of
       offshore loading systems may also be considered. Area is allocated on the ship for
       such facilities, together with space for process facilities that either could be used for
       gas processing or compression.

       The figure below shows the cargo tank cylinders arrangement on-board the Knutsen
       standard type offshore loading vessel. The vessel contains 2,672 PNG® cylinders of
       36 m height giving a total cargo capacity of about 800 MMscf for the Lean gas
       composition given in §1.1 and a pressure of 250 barg.

        All the full-scale tests required by DNV for the containment system qualification
        have been successfully completed and approval in principle was granted for the
        design and fabrication methods of the cylinders.
        Formal Approval has been given by DNV to EUROPIPE that they are qualified as
        supplier for the PNG cylinders according to the DNV Class Rules for Compressed

        According to Knutsen OAS Shipping, the above figure shows how the PNG®
        technology could be economically viable for certain volumes and distances in the
        market compared with LNG or pipeline. The PNG® system falls between pipeline
        and LNG and would be much more attractive for smaller volumes over relatively
        long distances. The volumes and distances considered are respectively 150-
        500 MMscf/d and 100-3,000 nautical miles.
        In that respect, Knutsen proposes several possibilities using their PNG system with,
        as examples, a FPSO equipped with gas/LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) mix storage
        and a CNG chain of terminal-to-terminal type vessel for evacuation of the produced
        gas and transportation to the customer(s).

 2.5.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
        The PNG® solution utilizes pressurized containers that can be combined in small or
        large configurations. It is a flexible solution that can be tailor-made to optimize a
        value chain. The smallest PNG® vessel proposed by Knutsen has a CNG cargo
        capacity corresponding to between 70 and 5 days production for the quantities of
        associated gas production considered for this report.



2.6. Trans Ocean Gas
        Trans Ocean Gas Inc. (TOG) is a natural gas transportation technology development
        company. It is a privately owned company, composed of a team of Oil & Gas
        industry experts, located in Newfoundland, Canada.
        TOG owns the patent rights to storing and transporting compressed natural gas by
        road, rail and sea in Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) pressure vessels.


 2.6.1. Technology
        Initially developed for road and train transport, the TOG Inc cylinder, named Type-
        4, has a laminate shell made by winding high-strength carbon fiber around HDPE
        liner. The corrosion resistant HPDE liner provides a high level of safety over steel
        systems when natural gas contains corrosive contaminants. It is complemented by a
        corrosion resistant stainless steel port boss at both ends.
        For the marine transport of large volumes of natural gas, TOG Inc proposes a
        laminate shell made of high-density polyethylene (same as for the liner) wrapped
        with continuous lengths of high-strength fibreglass. According to TOG Inc, the
        pressure vessels will weigh significantly more than the carbon fiber wrapped
        cylinder, but the cost to produce it will be approximately fifty percent lower.

           The TOG Inc pressure vessel is designed to withstand 750 barg pressure. Using a
           factor of safety of 3.0, the allowable operating pressure will be 250 barg. It can also
           withstand operating temperatures from -40°C to +40 °C .


 2.6.2. Marine transport vessels
           The TOG Inc ship-based concept is designed to easily convert a container ship into a
           gas carrier. Two types of containers combination, (which, under United Nations
           (UN) guidelines, is defined as a multi-element gas container or MEGC), are
           proposed by TOG Inc:

2.6.2.1.   THE 40-FT ISO SHIPPING CONTAINER MEGC
           It consists of eight large diameter (0.5m) pressure vessels secured inside an insulated
           40-foot shipping container. The MEGC will carry 255 MMscf of Lean gas as given
           in §1.1 at 250 barg and 25°C. Should the gas be loaded at -30°C, then the gas cargo
           would increase to 355 MMscf, but the possible loading temperature is highly
           dependant on the gas composition due to the high pressure. For instance, the Rich
           gas as given in §1.1 would require a minimum temperature of 22°C to remain in
           dense gas conditions. At 25°C, the Rich gas cargo would be 268 MMscf.
           The tare weight (empty) of the shipping container and pressure vessels is about
           16,000 kg.

2.6.2.2.   THE MODULAR CASSETTES SYSTEM
           The containment system is fabricated in modular cassettes for ease of installation
           and hook-up. Steel truss frames are used to vertically house and contain a number of
           FRP cylinders in each cassette. Cassettes frame are stacked several frames high to
           form a gas containment module.
           The cylinders are connected with duplex steel manifolds on both the top and bottom
           of each cassette.
           According to TOG Inc., the cassette system allows for 100% visual inspection while
           in service and the removal of condensed natural gas liquids during the voyage.
           Based on the arrangement illustrated below, the cylinders would have a diameter of
           1 m and a length of about 5 m. The gas cargo capacities are the same as for the 40-ft
           MEGC.

      While TOG Inc. has not developed a real ship concept, it is contemplating installing
      the MEGC modules or 40ft-containers on a barge, or on a retrofitted container ship.
      No information is provided on the way the pressurized gas will be handled at both
      loading and delivery points.


2.6.3. Key features and Comparison LNG
      A summary of TOG Inc. MEGC system is given below compared with the same
      volume of LNG expressed as energy content (btu/btu).
      For the cargo/containment weight ratio, only the weight of the gas container is
      considered without piping, valves and supporting frame. The gas cargo is calculated
      for the Lean gas composition given in §1.1 with loaded pressure and temperature of
      respectively 250 barg and 25°C and -30°C.

2.6.4. Certification
        ABS awarded approval in principle (AIP) to the Trans Ocean Gas concept in
        September 2003.
        Trans Ocean Gas Inc. was seeking financial support to launch the certification of its
        TOG Inc MEGC with its type-4 containers (2010). No more information is available
        for the present report.


2.6.5. Commercial references
        None.


2.6.6. Targeted Markets
        According to Trans Ocean Gas Inc., some of the applications that potential
        customers have indicated as a use for the TOG MEGC are listed below:
         The transport of stranded natural gas from an offshore marine location,
         The transport of stranded gas from a pipeline-restricted gas well,
         The transport of associate gas where flaring is restricted,
         The transport of natural gas from the production testing of a new well.



2.6.7. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
        The modular concept with cassettes or 40ft-shipping container might be applicable
        to the range of production rates considered in this report.
        A major effort was made for the development of the MEGC, but integration in a
        complete CNG transportation chain has still to be undertaken. These include
        facilities for loading and delivery, the connection between cassettes, modules and
        main loading headers on the ship itself whichwould require careful consideration.

2.7. Marine CNG – Comparison of technologies
      While some proponents, Sea NG CoselleTM and EnerSea VOTRANSTM and to some
      degree CETech, appear to be advanced in the definition of their overall system,
      including loading and offloading operations, the others still need to develop fully
      integrated systems.

2.8. Elements of Costs

 2.8.1. CNG transportation costs
        Costs found in the literature are generally related to daily transported volume far
        beyond the production rate of 1-15 MMscf/d considered in this study.
        Based on the information published between 2002 and 2013, mainly from SeaNG
        Coselle (C16 class carrier) VOTRANSTM and Knutsen, a consolidated unit cost per
        MMBtu was calculated (2014 updated) for marine CNG transportation as a function
        of transported volumes and travel distances.

           The unit price includes the cost of the loading and offloading facilities whether
        located on the ship or at source and delivery locations.

                          37 Figure Impact of facilities on total cost

As shown on the above graph, the costs of facilities may vary depending on the
project particulars (type of ship, jetty or buoy,..). They represent on average 12-22%
of the total cost which is higher than the percentage claimed by the technology
proponents (10-15%) but for larger volumes.




                                  55
2.8.2. Gas treatment costs
       Due to the nature of associated gases, one may expect that the gas will have to be
       treated/conditioned prior to loading. An additional unit cost should therefore be
       considered for the gas treatment units which would comprise:
        An H2S removal,
        A dehydration and CO2 adsorption unit,
        A hydrocarbon dew point control unit.

      If we neglect the scenarios involving long transportation distances which lead to
      prohibitive unit costs, the unit price of gas delivered as CNG, including the normally
      required pre- treatment, would range between 5-6 USD per MMBtu for low
      volumes and 3-3.5 USD per MMBtu for volumes close to 15 MMscf/d.



2.9. Conclusions for marine CNG
      This report addresses the possibility to recover gases associated with offshore oil
      fields and to transport them under pressurized compressed gas form (CNG) to
      potential customers. It specifically addresses gas volumes of production ranging
      between 1 and 15 MMscf/d.
      The various marine CNG systems developed in the 2000’s were designed for gas
      volumes much higher than those considered for this study. The capital cost of the
      ship being by far the major determinant of the project's profitability, the current
      proposed designs here do not match the range of produced volumes. In simple terms,
      the ships are too big. This issue has already been raised in 2009 by the Centre for
      Marine CNG in a paper prepared for the Offshore Technology Conference
      (OTC 20145).
      The proposed barge systems are questionable as they were not really developed by
      the technology providers. The SeaNG’s smallest C16 class carrier would be
      underutilized while it could be a solution for the upper limit of the production range.
      However, the combined oil and gas Aframax design, proposed by CETech, offers
      interesting possibilities as combining a crude oil cargo with the CNG helps reduce
      the otherwise high unit cost. Furthermore, gas is stored in horizontal pipes on the
      ship’s deck is an advantage from a safety point of view (leakage, regular
      inspection...) and would also remove the costfor nitrogen consumption.
      As a conclusion, one may say that marine CNG for small volumes of associated
      gases is at the limit of economic viability. Viability must be determined on a case by
      case basis, and depends mainly on the ship or barge design, transportation distance
      and volume, and also the need for and level of pre-treatment required at the source
      location.




3.    STATUS OF CNG TECHNOLOGIES – ON-SHORE
      CNG

3.1. Background
      On-shore CNG is a proven gas transport technology that has been around for
      decades. Natural Gas has seen an expanding interest in all parts of the world
      (Europe, North- and South-America, Asia) mainly driven by environmental concerns
      and to a lesser extent by the evolution of fuel costs including taxes. Natural gas has
      an increasing role in transportation especially in urban areas for community fleet
      vehicles like buses or refuse collection trucks where, compared to petroleum fuels,
      natural gas contributes to cleaner and healthier ambient air.
                                      57
Additionally, many rural areas are unlikely ever to receive pipeline gas because the
relatively few customers do not justify the costs of extending the pipelines to these
locations. Therefore several companies have developed CNG systems that will
compress natural gas so it can be loaded onto trucks and delivered to those industrial
and commercial customers without access to pipelines, creating what is called “a
virtual pipeline”.
The CNG system consists of:
 natural gas compression and truck loading facilities at the source location,
 truck offloading, heating, pressure letdown and metering facilities at the
  customer site.




The main technical constraints in bulk CNG transportation are:
  the weight of the containers, which impacts the operational cost,
 the filling operation which should ideally proceed quickly, but which induces
   high temperature due to the compression of the gas; high temperatures limit the
   pressure and therefore fill capacity of the container with a negative effect on the
   logistical costs (more trucks).
In most onshore CNG ventures, natural gas is usually withdrawn from an existing
gas pipeline. In CNG transportation at pressures ranging between 200 and 250 barg,
the gas must be further dried to prevent potential issues for condensation, hydrate
formation and freezing which can occur during filling and offloading operations.
In the case of associated gas, as for marine CNG, gas treatment and conditioning
will be necessary to ensure a safe and reliable carriage of the gas under high
pressure.

3.2. Road bulk CNG transportation
        Various CNG bulk transport systems are used by energy companies promoting
        virtual pipelines associated with clean fuel usage.


 3.2.1. Steel tube trailers
        The high pressure containment systems were first constructed of bundles of steel
        cylinders and, later on, made of higher strength steels for deliveries of compressed
        industrial gases (hydrogen, helium...). The cylinders are mounted on a trailer or
        chassis.




                     Figure 40 Super Jumbo Tube Trailer (Courtesy FIBA technologies Inc.)

        Their capacity is limited due to the weight of the steel cylinders and the road weight
        limitations (commonly 40-42 tons for such trailers).
        The latest generation are Jumbo and Super Jumbo tube trailers capable of carrying
        respectively 160-180,000 and 260-290,000 scf of natural gas at around 185 barg.


 3.2.2. GTM Type III cylinders module

       Luxfer-GTM Technologies has designed a complete line of GTMs for the storage
       and transportation of CNG. Constituted of an aluminum inner wall wrapped with
       carbon fiberglass resin, the cylinders, much lighter than the traditional steel
       cylinders, can be placed in scalable frames which are “manifolded” together. The
       frames can then be mounted on truck beds or inserted into 10 ft pods, or 20 ft. and
       40 ft long ISO shipping containers. These containers can then be transported on
       truck chasses. A five pod unit has a transportation capacity of 439,000 scf (12,488
       m3) of CNG


3.2.3. Lincoln TITANTM 4 composite cylinders
       Developed by Hexagon Lincoln, the design of the TITANTM gas cylinder is based
       upon Lincoln Composites' TUFFSHELL® technology. It has a HDPE liner, a
       filament wound carbon fibre/epoxy composite shell plus a polyurethane coating
       applied to the outer surface. The composite cylinders weigh 75 percent less than
       equivalent steel tubes.
       The TITANTM4 Module is a 40 ft ISO 1,496 certified shipping container which
       contains four TITAN cylinders. Each cylinder is almost 12 m in length and over 1 m
       in diameter and is designed to operate at 250 barg. In these conditions, one module
       can contain 7 to 8 000 kg of CNG or about 360,000 scf with a module tare weight of
       15,649 kg.

       The Galileo Virtual Pipeline® consists of a complete operational CNG chain based
       on a transport and storage module named MAT® that includes:

                                        60
1)   Modular CNG compression stations, placed on specially designed platforms
     (PAC) or provided on a skid, that compress the gas up to 250 barg into
     transport and storage modules,
2)   MAT® modules are used for storing and transporting CNG on a trailer,
     specially designed with an easy-to-operate exchange racking system to
     load/unload modules,
3)   PAD platforms are designed with a simple connection system to minimize both
     loading and unloading times,
4)   At the delivery location, a pressure regulating plant (PRP) including heating
     system, filtration and metering, can be provided to meet the required delivery
     pressure and temperature conditions.




                 Figure 44 Galileo MAT® gas transport module (Courtesy Verdek)

The transport and storage module MAT® consists of several ISO 9809 steel
cylinders manifolded together and mounted in a box designed, together with ST
racking system, for facilitating the handling, filling and offloading operations at both
ends of the virtual pipeline.
One MAT® module contains 34 or 39 cylinders each of 150 litres hydraulic capacity.
It can store 44,000 to 55,000 scf of natural gas at a pressure between 200 and
250 barg.
Galileo has developed three models of transport systems respectively with two, three
and four MAT’s, with a maximum transport capacity of 200,000 to 250,000 scf at
250 barg.

                                Table 10: Comparison CNG containment type for trailers

       The effective capacity highly depends on:
         the gas composition including the possible contaminants (corrosion),
        the loading conditions (fast fill or slow fill, cold gas filling) are also linked to the
          containment material and its capability to dissipate the heat of compression
          (plastic liners do not dissipate heat as efficiently as steel),
        the residual quantity of gas (hauling efficiency) prior to being returned for
          refilling.
       All these elements may significantly impact the capacity of the delivery chain.


3.2.6. Potential Application for 1-15 MMscf/d Gas Production
       High-way tube trailers have been used since the 1950’s for deliveries of compressed
       industrial gases. Later designs, with the introduction of light weight composite
       material or use of higher strength steels, allowed higher filling pressures and higher
       cargo volumes while remaining within permissible weights loads on highways.
       However, the transport weight restriction in practically all countries dramatically
       limits the weight of the tractor, trailer and payload. The following table gives for the
       theoretical maximum trailer capacity along with the number of trucks to be loaded
       per day for a number of associated gas production rates.

           Export of gas by truck is not sustainable, not only due to the huge truck traffic
           required, but also the size of loading and offloading facilities that would need to be
           put in place.
           Gas composition and presence of contaminants have a direct impact on the facilities
           costs at the oil field location.

 3.2.7. Elements of Cost

3.2.7.1.   CNG TRANSPORTATION COSTS (CAPEX)
           The Total Unit Cost estimation is mainly based on information retrieved for
           Galileo’s ‘Virtual Pipeline’ system. The Total Cost (Capex) is composed of the
           Facility Cost and the Transport Cost.
           The Facility Cost includes the loading compression station, the unloading station
           and the recompression (to the required user or pipeline pressure) facility. The
           Transport Cost includes the container (MAT module), the support (VST module)
           and the truck.




                                              63

handling facilities according to the increased distances and volumes with the
following assumptions:

3.2.7.2.   OPERATING COSTS
           The above delivery costs are given as an example for the specific Galileo
           technology. These costs depend on the type of transportation system (tube trailer or
           others). In that respect, it is interesting to compare the fuel consumption of the
           various types of CNG transport by truck. The following graphs give an idea of the
           fuel consumption for the lower and upper ends of the considered export range,
           knowing that, in general, fuel equates to about 30% of total operating costs of the
           truck fleet.




                                                                   66

3.2.7.3.   GAS TREATMENT COSTS
           Due to the nature of associated gases, one may expect that the gas will have to be
           processed/conditioned prior to loading. An additional unit cost should therefore be
           considered for the gas treatment units which comprise:
            A hydrogen sulphide removal unit,
            A dehydration and CO2 adsorption unit,
            A hydrocarbon dew point control unit.

3.3. Conclusions for on-shore CNG
      It is now economically viable to utilize high capacity CNG trailers to transport
      natural gas to areas unreached by pipeline supply, but only for relatively small
      volumes of gas.
      In the context of this report, CNG transportation by truck reaches its practical limit
      when the volume of associated gas to be exported exceed about 5 MMscf/d.


                                          68
      In simple terms, in contrast to the comment made about the size of CNG ships being
      too large, the trucks are too small.
      For volumes lower than about 5 MMscf/d and distances shorter than about 500 miles
      the total unit cost is around 5 USD/MMBtu. For longer distances, the cost and
      complexity of transportation as CNG becomes prohibitive.



4.    ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS FOR NATURAL GAS
      TRANSPORTATION

4.1. Transport as natural gas hydrates (NGH)
      The transport of natural gas in a hydrate form is attractive as the gas is transported in
      a solid state at moderate pressure and negative temperature. The negative storage
      temperature is maintained by active cooling.
      The principle for a hydrate based natural gas transportation system is:
        To produce hydrate pellets
        To transport the pellets
       To dissociated the pellets and recover the natural gas
      The production of hydrate pellets is based on mixing natural gas and water under
      appropriate operating conditions. The mixture is then worked to form pellets. The
      pellets are then cooled prior to be stored. The energy needs to produce hydrate
      pellets are similar to liquefaction process.
      A key issue during transport is to control the pressure and temperature conditions of
      the storage such that the hydrates stay in their solid form while optimizing energy
      consumption. Energy needs for transport are similar to CNG and are significantly
      higher than LNG as the volume of hydrates is about 4 times the volume of LNG for
      the same amount of gas.
      At the reception facilities, the hydrates are dissociated by heat exchange with sea
      water. The gas is compressed and fed into the pipeline network after drying, which
      is energy intensive as dissociation takes place at close to atmospheric pressure.
      It is to be noted that hydrates dissociation is not straightforward as the rate of
      dissociation varies significantly along the process. It is to be noted the natural gas
      composition influences the rate of dissociation.



4.2. Pressurized LNG (PLNG)
      LNG liquefies, and remains liquid, at a higher temperature when kept under
      pressure. The PLNG concept utilizes pressure to increase the storage temperature of
      the liquefied gas. Liquefaction of LNG requires considerable pre-treatment and has
      large power requirements, and pressurizing the LNG brings significant reduction of
      these requirements. The power required for liquefying the gas would be around 60
      % of that required for conventional LNG. Also the limits on CO2 and heavy
      hydrocarbon content are less severe than for conventional LNG liquefaction.

                                       69
      The concept has been developed by ExxonMobil, is still at the conceptual stage, and
      its economic viability is yet to be demonstrated.
      The optimal PLNG conditions for transportation were identified as follows
      compared to LNG and CNG:
                                         LNG                  PLNG                   CNG

      Pressure (barg)                        1                  17                  200-250

      Temperature (°C)                   -160                  -110                       25

      Cargo density (kg/m³)              440                   350                  188-223
                               Table 13: PLNG conditions for transportation




                 Figure 53 Conceptual 200,000 m³ PLNG ship design (Courtesy ExxonMobil)

      The potential benefits of PLNG should therefore come from a significant reduction
      in LNG export facilities: footprint, facilities, gas treating units… and also in the
      receiving terminals. However, application of PLNG for natural gas transportation
      would require a whole new delivery chain: liquefaction plants, PLNG carriers,
      PLNG storage vessels, PLNG receiving and regasification facilities..



4.3. Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)
      In recent years, there have been attempts to store natural gas under adsorptive form
      especially to increase the autonomy of natural gas vehicles. ANG is based on the
      property of solid material to adsorb gas molecules. Activated charcoal, for example,
      has a very large surface area because of its porous nature. This gives it the ability to
      adsorb large quantities of natural gas at relatively low pressures compared to CNG.
      Several operational issues must be addressed for ANG:
       significant heat is generated during adsorption, and desorption of the gas required
        heating. The heat conductivity of the adsorbent material is therefore important,
       high performance carbons have higher densities, and a compromise must be
        found between the weight of the adsorbent and its capacity to store gas,


                                        70
 storing and delivering the gas implies cyclic operations that, over time, have
  detrimental effects on the storage capacity and mechanical resistance of the
  adsorbent (attrition);
 the ANG storage is depressurized at nearly the atmospheric pressure in order to
  maximize the net storage capacity with as consequence that a discharge
  compressor be needed to achieve the required delivery pressure.
 gas composition may be a serious issue as heavier hydrocarbon molecules are
  large compared to methane and may not be so readily adsorbed,
 the presence of contaminant, even in small quantities in the feed gas, can
  accumulate preferentially on the adsorbent.
The viability of this method for large transportation capacities is questionable, but it
may provide substantial benefits as containers for vehicles or cooking applications.

5.     CNG MARKET IN USA

5.1. CNG as fuel for vehicles
       From the early 1990s, compressed natural gas (CNG) fuelling infrastructure
       experienced a rapid development in USA. The 1992 Energy Policy Act, which
       sought to increase clean energy use and to improve overall energy efficiency,
       marked the first governmental incentive for traditional fuelled vehicle users to
       switch to alternative fuelled vehicles. It gave the US Department of Energy the
       power to determinate the minimum light duty alternative fuel vehicles share required
       in Federal fleets. By 1999, 75% of vehicles acquired by the Federal Government
       were required to be alternatively fuelled.
       In 1995, the Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) Industry Strategy, issued by the National
       Gas Vehicle Coalition, Gas Research Institute and American Gas Association, was
       developed to set a unified vision of the market industry and to boost the use of
       natural gas in transportation. In order to set a strategy, the industry stakeholders first
       defined their areas of action as shown in the following figure.




                               Figure 54 Source: NGV Industry Strategy, 1995

       As part of the strategy to develop the NGV marketplace, the NGV Industry Strategy
       set the following key goals:
        To position NGVs to compete on an economic basis (reducing life cycle costs
         and taking advantages of governmental programs),
        To penetrate high fuel use fleet applications,
        To ensure availability of vehicle and fuel facilities, products and services in
         order to satisfy the demand,
        To deploy public open access and private onsite fuelling facilities when
         appropriate (transit agencies, refuse trucks, delivery fleets among others).


                                         72
The NGV Industry Strategy working group developed actions to pursue these key
objectives and achieved a significant growth of the industry in the period 1992-
1995.
As part of the industry approach, local NG distribution companies became involved
in marketing to secure a bigger share in the marketplace, and also got closer to the
main manufacturing associations in order to promote more evolved NGV
equipment. Furthermore, these distribution companies begin to use NGV technology
in their own fleets, requiring large quantities of fuel. As the typical CNG stations in
USA at that time were not able to provide those volumes, a significant effort was
required to design and implement adequate fuelling infrastructure sized for these
fleets.
The promotion of CNG was encouraged in spite of the decline in local gas
production and the growth of natural gas imports by pipeline and vessel (LNG).
While CNG has remained cheaper than diesel or gasoline, until recently the gap
between them was not sufficient to justify the investment in vehicle conversion to
CNG. Fleet managers rather chose flex-fuel ethanol vehicles over NGV due to their
convenience and minimal conversion cost, resulting in significant growth of ethanol
fuelled vehicles in the USA as illustrated below.

NGV supply infrastructure expanded until 1997 then, deflecting the preference for
flex-fuelled ethanol vehicles, declined to a low of 721 stations in 2007. Investment
then began to increase again at a moderate pace until 2011 (47 new stations per year
on average), and more aggressively later (177 new stations per year on average) as
shown in the graph below.

This recent expansion (2008 - 2014) is explained by plateau or minor increasing of
NG prices (as a result of the unconventional natural gas boom) against the large
raise of diesel and gasoline prices and a severe excise duty increase on ethanol in
2011, which made it economically less attractive.

The NGV infrastructure business faces a significant conundrum. To grow demand
requires investment in infrastructure, but the cost of CNG stations is quite high and
achieving the required volume of sales to deliver an economic return is often slow,
thus discourage investment in the infrastructure. Several industry stakeholders have
been calling for governmental measures to mitigate the impact of these competing
factors that impede market growth.
Nonetheless, NGV fuel supply has been steadily increasing as shown in the graph
below. However, the market remains very small (90 MMscf/d in 2014), taking into
account the potential of the country.

In 2014, USA had almost 1,500 CNG operational filling stations across the country,
with160 stations planned to be built in the near future. California ranked top in the
list of states with 286 CNG stations, followed by New York, Oklahoma, Texas and
Utah, which have about 100 stations each.
In terms of access, the share of the CNG filling stations is 33% private (i.e. tied to
supplying a specific vehicle fleet), 54% public and 13% addressed to private-
government fleets. The graph shows the number of stations by access in 2015.

While the market is open to new players (according to US Energy Information
Administration 120 companies were operational in 2013), just 3 of them represent
74% of the NGV market: Southern California Gas Company (37%), Clean Energy
(28%) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (9%).
Southern California Gas Company currently serves 20 million customers (residential
and NGV supply). The company has more than 100 public CNG stations in the state
and also promotes a home refuelling appliance.

             Clean Energy is focused on NG for transportation. The company owns its stations
             and also manufactures, sells and installs NG station components to its clients. Its
             nationwide network relies on 500 NG fuelling stations (LNG for heavy duty and
             CNG for light and medium duty vehicles).
             Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) provides natural gas and energy to 16 million
             customers in California. Based on data from the US Department of Energy, its fleet
             operation is one of the nation´s largest for a public utility, and includes 3,400
             alternative fuelled vehicles (natural gas, hybrid and electric) 1. The company also
             owns 32 private CNG and LNG fuelling stations2.
             With regard to demand, the number of CNG vehicles has followed the same pattern
             as that of the NG stations, with a decline over the period 2002-2010 followed by a
             recovery after 2011.

             Even though demand and supply have been following a similar pattern, the USA´s
             average supply per station is below that of other countries. This means that the
             growth in the number of stations has outstripped demand and stations are, on
             average, underutilized.

5.2. Flaring gas utilization experiences
       CNG and LNG use has not had a significant impact in reducing gas flaring in the
       USA. Based on the 2012 update of the National Development and Reform
       Commission (NDRC) Natural Gas Utilization Policy only 0.1% of the current flared
       gas could be reduced by these technologies. Recently however, a number of new
       developments have raised interest in using CNG to reduce flaring.
       General Electric & Statoil have developed a low-cost prototype to capture flared
       natural gas in the Bakken field in North Dakota. The system, “CNG in a box”,
       consists of process equipment to remove the natural gas liquids (butane and
       propane) for petrochemical uses, the remaining methane (CNG) being used to power
       dual fuel engines on converted drilling rigs, replacing 40% of the diesel normally
       used. Statoil estimates that more than 60 MMMscf, 5% of currently flared gas, could
       be saved (used and reducing emissions) every day if the pilot project is replicated in
       all rigs operating in the Bakken field. Currently Statoil is proposing to convert the
       fracturing equipment and light truck fleet in the Bakken to CNG fuel using gas
       currently flared.
       Finally, Mobile Fuel Solution (MFS) recently announced implementation of ‘virtual
       pipelines’ consisting of CNG trucked from oil fields to consumption areas in New
       York. The trucks are designed with 2 pods of gas cylinders holding the equivalent of
       715 gallons of gasoline. The virtual pipelines are intended to supply NG fuelled
       vehicles in areas with no access to the gas grid. MFS will launch the first virtual
       pipeline in February 2015 with the beverage industry's distribution fleet among the
       first customers, and a refuse collection fleet and the Environment Remediation
       Department as other potential users. Long Island will act as the main station of from
       which the system of mobile stations will be provided. MFS will launch a second
       virtual pipeline in July 2015 which main station would be at Orangetown, located in
       the north of New York State.

5.3. CNG as fuel for vessels
       The first attempts to ship CNG by sea date back to the 1960s. The Columbia Gas
       Company developed a CNG containment system on board a converted ship, the
       “MV Sigalpha”, with a 1.3 MMscf capacity. The ship made a dozen successful trips
       (around New York Harbor). However, the operations ceased due to the high capital
       cost of the ship technology.




                                        Figure 62 MV Sigalpha- Source: Centre for Marine CNG

       However, marine CNG has been identified as a niche technology that could
       complement LNG and pipeline technologies for stranded gas monetization. As a
       result, in the last decades several less expensive CNG transportation technologies
       have been developed.
       It is important to note that one of the major benefits of CNG transportation over
       LNG technology is the small fixed capital asset: there is no requirement of
       liquefaction and regasification terminals and the main asset is transportable (the
       CNG vessel). Consequently, depending on gas supply agreements, seasonality
       and/or life of field, the ship can be relocated. According to a study carried out by
       Wood Mackenzie, a CNG supply chain costs a quarter of a LNG chain, based on
       equivalent gas volume.

6.   CNG MARKET IN CHINA
     China´s concerns about environmental issues and securing energy requirements for
     the future have triggered an official policy to pursue a rapid rise in natural gas use.
     As it was mentioned in the LNG Report, the 2010 five-year development plan called
     for the share of natural gas in the total primary energy matrix to be increased from
     5% in 2011 to 8% by 2015. To achieve the objective, the Government applied a
     number of measures to promote the use of gas.
     At the end of 1980s, the first CNG filling stations came online in China, specially
     addressing taxis and light commercial vehicles. But the most populous country in
     the world made a significant deployment of CNG five years ago, when cities, such
     as Beijing, Chengdu and Hong Kong, converted buses and taxis to CNG in an effort
     to reduce notoriously toxic urban air pollution. Currently, it is estimated that there
     are almost 3 million NG fuelled vehicles on the road, six times as many as just five
     years ago, when deployment of NGVs took off.

     Driven by energy security and urban air quality concerns, Beijing, the capital of
     China, has made concerted efforts to increase the use of natural gas economy-wide,
     especially in transportation. Based on the 2012 update of the National Development
     and Reform Commission (NDRC) Natural Gas Utilization Policy, NGV have been
     deemed a priority use of natural gas over power generation and the chemical
     industry. As a result, a domestic industry has been developed to supply NGV
     equipment and infrastructure, with state-owned enterprises taking the lead to expand
     this market.
     Several cities, such as Chongqing, Urumqi, Xi’an, Lanzhou, Xining, have a natural
     gas transportation and distribution system through a pipeline grid. In these cases,
     95% of the taxis and inter-city buses are CNG fuelled.

Large disparities exist among cities in terms of natural gas use. Mega cities like
Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Chengdu began to promote natural gas use in the
public transportation system (mainly in buses and taxis) in the late 1990s. After
more than 10 years of development, these cities have become mature systems and
several lessons have been learned from their experience. Medium and small sized
cities are following the trend by exploring the application of natural gas, firstly in
public transport and later in private motor vehicles. Dongguan is a good example.
Dongguan, a medium sized city, located in the south of Guangdong Province, has
been plagued by acid rain for years. In 2006, the municipality began to encourage
agreements between natural gas providers and interested taxi car owners to initiate
mixed fuel taxi retrofits. In order to further promote natural gas application in public
transport, the municipality published The Implementation Plan of Natural Gas
Vehicle Fuelling Project Promotion in Dongguan in 2008. As an encouragement
measure, the Plan offered subsidies for refuelling stations, buses and taxis that
would convert from oil to gas technology over the period 2008-2010. The Plan also
set out the expansion goals for the following years.

Selected long distance bus terminals and urban bus stations were encouraged to
participate in the CNG transformation in Dongguan. Measures were taken to
accelerate conversion of traditional vehicles to CNG/mixed fuel, including setting
time schedules for CNG bus purchases, refusing licenses to non-converted buses,
and introducing charges to taxis that exceeded limit emission level. The Plan also
required CNG refuelling station locations to be consistent with the overall urban
development plan and compliant with industry standards.
Dongguan is a successful case in terms of natural gas promotion but, the application
is still struggling with several issues: regulation and supervision of pricing and
quality of service in a market where there is no competition. In conclusion, medium
and small sized cities might take into consideration Dongguan experience, planning
and lessons, in an attempt to apply a successful natural gas program.
The Chinese NGV manufacturing industry is growing quickly. There are more than
60 NGV vehicle manufacturers in the country, and production of components for
NGV filling stations (pressure reducers, electronic control units and gas nozzles) is
increasing. China has developed its own purification facilities, storage facilities,
compressors and dispensers for stations and this equipment meets 90%, sometimes
even 100%, of the domestic market. Locally-developed vehicles and facilities reduce
the cost of vehicles and stations. Nevertheless, the scale of production is
comparatively small, since many manufacturers produce only small volumes. It
should be noted that, as well as passenger cars, minibuses, and light-duty trucks,
Chinese light duty NGVs include motorcycle, CNG or bi-fuel rickshaws, and bi-fuel
tricycles for disabled persons.
In order to support a nationwide transition toward increased NG fuelled vehicles, the
government faces an important challenge: to supply gas for the rapidly increasing
number of natural gas fuelled vehicles. Public and private operators of NGV stations
realize the need of expanding the refuelling supply capacity all over the country.
Even in countries with well-developed gas pipeline infrastructure, there are locations
that are not reached by the grid, and mother/daughter stations can play a key role
ensuring access to CNG. However, the system presents some restrictions: while
daughter stations are well-suited for light duty CNG vehicles, they may offer design
and operational challenges for heavy duty CNG vehicles.
The economic incentive to switch to CNG in China is not as strong as in USA,
mainly explained to higher gas prices, the government support is stronger than North
America.




                                     81
     The main lesson of China CNG policy is that government action - through state-
     owned enterprises investments - can be effective to achieve a sustainable scale,
     breaking the vicious circle produced by the coordination problem in the market.




7.   CNG MARKET IN PAKISTAN
     Pakistan is ranked as the 6th most populated country in the world with 185 million
     people in 2014. Taking in view its growth rate of 9% during the last 30 years, it is
     expected its population will reach around 250 million people in 2025. Even if the
     urban population of the country is almost 37%, far lower than the five most
     populated countries of the list, Pakistan is in the 10th top ranking position of urban
     population. In other words, Pakistan has been and will be dealing with pollution
     issues in the main cities.
     The natural gas story in Pakistan started in 1952, with the discovery of gas field at
     Sui in Balochistan. The initial consumers were the power generation industry, widen
     later to other industries and residential and commercial sectors.
     Taking into account the lack of domestic fuels and the already deployed
     infrastructure network for transmission and distribution (pipeline grid), the
     Government of Pakistan identified domestic natural gas, particularly CNG, as an
     adequate alternative fuel for vehicles. Even if the first CNG stations were
     implemented by the Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) in
     Karachi 1982 and Islamabad in 1989, the Petroleum Policies launched in 1992, 1995
     and 1998 set the framework for the CNG promotion. The main objectives of these
     policies were to decrease imports of gasoline and diesel oil and to improve
     environmental conditions in the cities. Promulgation of CNG safety rules, approval
     of infrastructure required and a number of incentives to private investors set the
     beginning of a CNG era. As part of these incentives, the Government of Pakistan
     established a liberal approval to obtain licenses for CNG retailing, a free market
     consumer price of CNG, natural gas tariff linked to petrol price, priority of natural
     gas connection to CNG stations and exemption of import duty and sales tax for CNG
     station and vehicle conversion equipment. Unlike some other countries, the
     promotion of the CNG industry in Pakistan did not set a direct subsidy. Even more,
     power and CNG sectors pay proportionally higher prices to cross-subsidize the
     fertilizer and residential sectors. Furthermore, the 1998 policy announced a 2 year
     target of establishing 150 CNG stations and converting 100,000 vehicles.
     By middle of 2000s the replacement of gasoline vehicles by CNG technology was a
     very successful. However, imported diesel oil still represented a significant bill for
     the Government and the air pollution was very severe. The small gap price between
     gas (as it is shown in the figure 61) and diesel and the high conversion cost were not
     attractive enough to encourage the sought conversion. As part of the promotion the
     Government of Pakistan launched programs to gradually phase out diesel buses in
     the major cities of the country and increase CNG fuelled vehicles.

             Over the following years, the CNG market increased rapidly. In the period 2000-
             2010 the number of CNG stations has increased from 150 to 3,331, while the
             number of vehicles running on CNG has risen from 120,000 to 2,740,000. Based on
             Statistics and Europe (2013) the country has 3.1 million vehicles running on CNG,
             which represents almost 90% of the cars of the country3. Based on International
             Association of Natural Gas Vehicles Statistics (IANGV) Pakistan has the second
             largest CNG vehicles fleet in the world, second only to Iran.

Regarding demand, in the period 2000 – 2010 the CNG industry consumption has
been raising at a rate of 11% annually, reaching currently 325 MMscf/d, which
represents 9% of the production of gas in Pakistan. In the following figure is
exposed the evolution of fuels share in the sector.

                                    natural gas as a vehicular fuel in Pakistan: Issues and prospects

The energy crisis that the country is suffering has led to natural gas shortages (due to
the decrease in indigenous gas reserves and production since 2008, as it is shown in
the Figure 65, which are affecting some key sectors of the Pakistani economy such
as power generation and industry (fertilizers, cement and textile among others).
Consequently, the Pakistan’s economy has been shrinking proportionately, dropping
from a GDP growth of 6.8% in 2007 to a GDP growth of 1.6% in 2010. However,
last two years growth has been increasing reaching 4.4% in 2013 due to a faster than
expected manufacturing sector recovery.


                                                      84
The Pakistan government launched a plan in 2010 looking to step down the natural
gas demand for transportation use. The plan included “the gas holidays”, where gas
supply to CNG stations is cut off for several days in the week, an imposed ban on
import of CNG conversion kids and cylinders. Recently, restrictions to several OEM
companies to stop conversion of CNG vehicles were implemented, without previous
negotiation, leading to an incipient tension between the Government and
stakeholders.




Figure 70 Evolution of Gas Production and Consumption by sector in Pakistan - Source: Energy Year
               Book (EYB), Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP)

Pakistan is currently looking at a number of alternatives to solve its natural gas
shortage. Based on the State Bank of Pakistan, if gas well-head prices were properly
formulated and gas companies were run strictly on a commercial basis, will force to
a more efficient use of the gas, prioritizing industrial and generation sector over
CNG and household. In this scenario the following implications are foreseen:
1.   “Existing gas fields that are commercial unviable would automatically come
     on-line, which could increase Pakistan’s gas production quite significantly;
2.   Competitive well-head gas prices would also encourage fresh exploration,
     which could increase total gas reserves in the country;
3.   Although the cost of gas production would automatically increase, we think
     more reflective pricing would incentivize more efficient usage.”
There are also two LNG import projects under study: Floating Regasification and
Storage Unit (FSRU) at Port Qasim and a second FSRU near Karachi. With the
arrival of LNG in the country, the Pakistan government expects to reduce the petrol
consumption by almost two billion litres per annum and recover the industry and
CNG as fuel which has suffered natural gas restrictions over the last 4 years.
However, progress has been very slow and it is uncertain whether their plans will
materialise over the medium term.

8.    APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES

8.1. Opportunities for small scale CNG
      Currently, there are several transportation technologies vying to monetize natural
      gas. In order to design an efficient project, it is very important to determine the best
      technology in each case. There are two main parameters to take into consideration:
      the volume to supply and the distance to transport the resource. According to the
      SBC Energy Institute, the most economic technologies with regard to distance and
      volume (order of magnitude) are shown in the following graph.




         Figure 71 Options to monetize natural gas- Source: Introduction to Natural Gas –SBC Energy
         Institute

      According to this very broad-brush analysis, CNG is primarily competing with
      pipeline gas. CNG is attractive up to 2,000 km and 5-6 Bcm/year (equivalent to 175
      - 210 Bcf/y), while for short distances and larger volumes, a pipeline is typically
      more attractive than CNG. For larger volumes and distances, LNG or GTL are
      preferred options.
      Regarding flaring reduction, several investment projects are in development to
      minimize and, thus, monetize the produced associated gas being flared. These
      projects can be classified into three major groups, namely: export oriented (LNG),
      domestic oriented (60% used for power generation) and field utilization (Gas lift, re-
      injection and natural gas as fuel for field uses).
      The monetization of natural gas has not been a business option for major and
      marginal oil field companies. It was perceived as an unwanted by-product of crude
      oil production and natural gas flare off was not a problem for oil and gas managers.
      In recent years, only export-oriented large-scale LNG projects were considered a
      good prospect to monetize flared gas.
      Nowadays, the situation is slowly beginning to change. Alternatives to monetize
      natural gas in the domestic market are gaining momentum. The small-scale use of
      CNG is currently considered a business strategy to produce benefits for firms and
      utility services consumers. Among other profits, it might reduce natural gas flaring
      (economical inefficiency and environmental pollution) and develop a nationwide
      local market for natural gas utilization.


                                        86
         Probably, new technologies such as “CNG in a Box” can be applied to flaring sites,
         not only by strictly economic reasons but also environmental issues.



8.2. Nigeria
         The small-scale use of CNG is slowly progressing in power generation,
         transportation and industrial sectors in Nigeria.
         It must be considered that environmental problems linked to climate change, such as
         gas flaring, make Nigeria very vulnerable. This problem, plus the increasing value
         for money of the natural gas business provides room for cost-effective small scale
         CNG projects. It was underlined by the Minister of Petroleum Resources Mrs.
         Diezani Alison-Madueke while citing examples from the country’s oil industry
         experience on environmental issues called on global operators of the oil and gas
         industry to re-strategize on sustainable policies for the sector in a Conference
         organized by the James Baker Institute for Public Policy Rice University in
         December 2014. The Minister assured that Nigeria is leveraging the Clean
         Development Mechanism (CDM) to access funds for major projects. She emphasize
         the gas flaring problem and the environmental degradation in the Niger Delta
         wrought by the activities of major International Oil Companies operating in Nigeria
         and moves by government to outlaw gas flaring.
         The main issue in Nigeria is not the supply of natural gas, but an inadequate gas
         transmission and distribution infrastructure, and a low level of industrialization
         hampering development of potential anchor demand. Domestic demand is only
         about 400 MMscf/d, which is very low considering the large population.
         However, several sectors could be potential “anchor” demands for CNG, such as:
         “peak’ power generation (especially for “peaker” plants), small isolated power
         generation for industries, electric power for marginal fields and transport.


8.2.1.   CNG as fuel for power generation
         The Island Power Project, a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between Lagos State
         Government (LASG) and Island Power Limited (IPL), currently supplies electricity
         generated using CNG supplied gas to several hospitals, judicial buildings,
         commercial buildings and shops, and public lighting installations on 22 Streets on
         Lagos Island. The reliability of power supply was drastically improved from 35% to
         99.4%. The project was executed in 9 months and is considered one of the most
         successful Independent Power Projects in Nigeria.
         The objective of the second stage of the project is to increase the generation capacity
         of the power plant from 10MW to 114MW using natural gas supplied by pipeline to
         supply power to Lagos Island central business district.
         These examples show the room for business opportunities based on CNG solutions
         fuelling power stations in Nigeria. According to the Petroleum Gas University of
         Ploiesti, in particular the east part of the country, especially Port Harcourt, has a
         great potential for CNG technology, and it should be exploited.




                                         87
         Gas Network Services Limited (GNSL) has installed a CNG mother station (CMS)
         facility on the Ilasamaja on Oshodi-Apapa express way in Lagos State that supplies
         customers in the Lagos and surroundings areas that are not reached by the grid. This
         CMS facility was designed for an initial output capacity of 5.25 MMscf/d at a
         discharge pressure of 250 barg. CNG is loaded into mobile tube trailers for onward
         delivery to daughter stations customer locations, and will serve customers within a
         200km radius. The facility has also dispensing points for filling Natural Gas
         Vehicles (NGVs). Gas supply to the CMS comes from a service line that taps into an
         existing Gaslink Nigeria Limited pipeline along the Oshodi-Apapa Express Way.


8.2.2.   Small scale power generation for isolated industries
         The reliable power demand of isolated industries (not connected to the grid) is
         encouraging small-scale CNG projects in Nigeria. Typical industries using CNG are
         steel, aluminium, fertilizer/agriculture, cement and glass.
         Nestlé Nigeria Plc. pioneered the use of CNG as a fuel source for its Flowergate
         factory, reducing electricity costs by 30%. The choice for CNG hinged on the fact
         that, aside from being a reliable fuel source of power generation, it is highly cost
         effective and clean. As for the Island Power Project described in the section above,
         the use of CNG at this factory is expected to be a transition solution while a gas
         pipeline is built.
         Oil and Gas companies are also active in providing CNG solutions. Shell Petroleum
         Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) provides CNG as fuel for
         several isolated industries and power generation facilities over a 100 km radius in
         the Niger Delta.
         Substitution of expensive fuels by CNG is also a developing option. GE created a 60
         km ‘virtual pipeline’ (2 trucks deliveries a day) to provide gas for industrial
         activities substituting diesel by CNG in Sagamu (Ogun state, Nigeria) in 2012. The
         substitution resulted in a 45% reduction in fuel costs.


8.2.3.   CNG as fuel for transport
         The use of CNG for transportation provides the opportunity to reduce emissions
         from flaring and, at the same time, to diminish emissions from their own
         transportation energy use. Additionally, there is a persistent gap between supply and
         demand of gasoline.
         However, adoption of CNG as a transportation fuel has been a slow process. CNG as
         vehicular fuel was first proposed in Nigeria in 1997 with 25 vehicles converted to
         run on natural gas. In 2013, there were still only 2,210 NGV and 8 refuelling
         stations (Ogunlowo, 2014).
         It can be argued that some policy instruments can be used for promoting natural gas
         vehicles in Nigeria: government action - through state-owned enterprises
         investments (as in China) and availability of inexpensive gas to this market (as in
         USA).




                                        88
         Regardless of what is the best set of governmental policies, some private companies
         are doing business in the CNG market at Nigeria. For instance, IMW Industries
         (Clean Energy Compression Corp.) and Borkir International Co. Ltd. (member of
         the Dangote Group of Companies) have announced the development of CNG fueling
         stations in Nigeria, beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The Dangote Group has
         approximately 5,000 trucks in their own fleets to convert to CNG and will also be
         supporting CNG fuelling and conversions. They have a CNG truck conversion
         facility in Ileka, Lagos state.


8.2.4.   Natural Gas from Marginal fields
         In 2003, the Federal Government of Nigeria awarded twenty-four (24) marginal
         fields to indigenous companies for exploitation. These marginal fields featured : low
         reserves of crude oil (less than 20 million stock tank barrels of crude oil), low crude
         oil daily production rates (expected or producing less than 4,000 stb/day), 8-15 years
         economic life, low to moderate net present values (NPVs), and low natural gas
         reserves (less than 100 Bscf: AG and NAG) .
         Many marginal fields are using less than one percent of their produced associated
         natural gas. Therefore, small-scale CNG solutions appear to be an alternative to
         monetize natural gas, to enhance the economic performance of these marginal fields
         and achieve an effective gas flare reduction with subsequent environmental benefits.


         An example is Lekoil’s plan for
         the Otakikpo field in OML 11,
         located near the coast in the
         Niger Delta, Lekoil plans to use
         the associated gas for its plant
         utility, plant power generation
         and external electrical power
         supply to the immediate
         community. Surplus associated
         gas will be offered to a third
         party at the battery limit (p. 53,
         Chandler et al., 2014).

         It is expected that projects such as Lekoil´s or the USA´s “CNG in a box” could be
         replicated in other marginal fields of Nigeria.



8.3. Iraq
         Iraq has the 12th largest natural gas reserves in the world; however NG use in the
         primary energy mix is quite insignificant (1%). Furthermore, in 2011, the country
         flared 7.5% of the world total. Thus, the country´s picture offers an interesting
         opportunity to reduce flaring and monetize the produced associated gas.
         Different technologies could be used to achieve this objective: LNG, CNG amongst
         others. Nevertheless, Iraq has not yet made significant steps in this direction and
         opportunities identified below may need a natural gas market to be a developed prior
         to introducing even small scale CNG projects.


8.3.1.   CNG as fuel for power generation
         The lack of fuel for power generation is a nationwide issue in Iraq. However,
         Kurdistan seems to be addressing this issue in a more efficient way than the rest of
         the country. According to Dana Gas, which is currently the main provider of natural
         gas to the power generation sector, Kurdistan had only two hours of electricity per
         day in 2007. By 2008, the Company (in partnership with Crescent Petroleum)
         launched the production, compression and delivery of natural gas from the northern
         fields of Khor Mor and Chemchemal to supply the two power plants in the area:
         Erbil and Chemchemal. The facility consists of two brand new gas processing and
         LPG extraction plants, which have a combined capacity of 270 MMscf/d and an
         enhancement production facility to increase the production to 330 MMscf/d. The gas
         production is shipped by a 180 km pipeline to the power plants (2,000MW), which
         represent 2/3 of Kurdistan generation capacity in 2013. In conclusion, KRG has
         already tripled its 2015 target for gas fired power generation one year earlier. It is
         important to note that LPG experiences could be a preliminary stage to CNG
         development in small power generation plants.
         Based on the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard
         Kennedy School, in Kurdistan the power generation system, gas fuelled, supplies
         twenty hours of the day, however in the rest of Iraq, the population suffers frequent
         and severe power outages that can last for almost an entire day.
         Regarding the national picture, according to the expert Khaled Abubarkr, political
         instability is the major constraint for monetizing gas reserves in the country, since
         any investment in this field requires certain stability on the political and regulatory
         framework.
         Besides, “any future decision to export gas without domestic demand being fully
         satisfied will likely be met by strong public opposition”. In other words, the
         development of the natural gas market would be possible only if the Government
         send clear signs of stability, and, the project has the following order: first, to supply
         the local market, and then, to export the rest of the resource.



                                          90
         This scheme seems to be in line with the Dana Gas business plan in Kurdistan,
         which affirmed that the company will address its gas production to export, “after
         fulfilling the gas demand in the local market”. In fact, the company plans to export
         to Europe through the Turkey pipeline 350 billion cubic feet (Bcf) by 2020 -2025.
         The rest of Iraq, which is one step behind, has a promising path to move along if the
         supply of local demand is kept as a priority. The oil production growth, destined to
         export, will continue to increase gas flaring; of which monetization will be a key
         factor in the development of the domestic gas market.
         As already identified, the knowledge and experience acquired in Iraq in the gas field
         could leave room in the future for CNG developments, and furthermore small scale
         CNG projects. As observed in the Chinese and USA´s markets, a learning curve is
         necessary to succeed in the small scale developments.




8.3.2.   CNG as fuel for transportation
         The 270 km Iraq – Iran pipeline was completed in 2014 to export 875 MMscf/d
         from Iran to Iraq, starting with 245 MMscf/d; however, the inauguration of the
         pipeline has been suffering delays due to unrest in Iraq. The main goal of the
         pipeline is to supply the Al Mansoureh power plant; nevertheless, Iranian private
         companies, which run the project in venture with the state owned company, have
         been commissioned to build the first ten CNG stations in Iraq. Their construction
         will begin as soon as the pipeline becomes operational.
         Transportation is a growing market in Iraq. The average motorization rate in 2010,
         100 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants (Kurdistan being the region with the highest rate),
         was quite high compared to countries like India or China. Furthermore, it is
         expected this rate will grow in the future driven by the high GDP growth
         perspectives: 175 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants by 2020 and 200 vehicles per 1,000
         inhabitants by 2035.
         Taken into consideration that Iran has a developed and mature market of CNG (Iran
         has the largest CNG utilising fleet in the world with 3 million vehicles) and the
         promising growth of private fleets in Iraq, the implementation of Iranian CNG
         stations could be the first step of a new market in Iraq. Private Iranian firms
         experience in CNG, National Oil Companies as “market makers”, could provide the
         required knowledge to give birth to the CNG market in Iraq.


8.3.3.   CNG as fuel for industries
         North Oil Company (NOC) is a state owned company which operates oil and gas
         fields in the north of Iraq (from Baghdad governorate to Nineveh and Erbil
         governorates). NOC offers separation and compression of associated gas process, in
         order to supply the North Gas Company (NGC). The major share of this processed
         gas is the industrial sector, which use it as fuel. This company might be a key driver
         to develop CNG solutions for industries and public power plants in Iraq.
         In Kurdistan, according to Dana Gas, a Gas City Project, which consists in the
         supply of an industrial zone and several residential and commercial areas, was being
         studied in 2014. The implementation of this project is the next challenge for the
         company, which aims to open the gas market to new local users.

                                        91
8.3.4.   CNG as fuel for military sector
          Iraq´s military sector has a significant demand of traditional fuel which could be
          replaced by natural gas use. However, according to the Assistant Secretary of
          Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, the conversion from traditional
          fuel to natural gas by its bases would present several inconveniences for the USA
          tactical fleet. Main reasons are availability, compatibility and energy density. Firstly,
          in regard of availability, the USA forces need to rely on a source which can be
          globally sourced and distributed, and natural gas does not respond to this
          requirement. Secondly, regarding compatibility, natural gas vehicles need a
          particular technology engine, which requires an investment in infrastructure and
          engine adaptation. Finally, in terms of energy density, natural gas vehicles have
          significant less autonomy than gasoline or diesel vehicles (due to the size of the
          storage tank), which is a key factor in the military sector. Currently, USA has not
          considered CNG for its military bases in Iraq; however its further appreciation on
          this point could be interesting.
          It is important to note that all these barriers only apply to operational fleet in the
          bases, which is the 75% of the bases energy demand. The other 25%, which is
          explained by domestic installations, could have less constraint to make the
          conversion to natural gas fuel. Since the military bases are spread all over the
          country, the grid does not reach all of them, and according to the required demand
          volume, an infrastructure investment would not be cost effective. In those cases
          small scale CNG technology could be a solution worthwhile of a study.



8.4. Indonesia
          Indonesia is a seismically active archipelago with more than 17,000 islands, making
          pipeline and interconnecting transmission power system very complex. Gas
          transportation facilities and power transmission infrastructure is mostly located in
          Java and North Sumatra, while they remain almost non-existent in the other islands.
          According to the country's economic projected growth and the government´s goal to
          minimize dependency on oil, the expansion of domestic gas utilization (transported
          by new technologies) might be an answer. This application may provide also a
          cleaner and cheaper alternative fuel for electricity generation.
          Indonesia has the 14th gas reserves in the world, spread in several fields (Natuna,
          South Sumatra, East Kalimantan and Tangguh Papua). A large share of these gas
          resources are committed to long term supply agreements with other countries
          (through LNG liquefaction terminals).


8.4.1.   CNG as fuel for power generation
          Considering that natural gas is a large energy source (even if it is dispersed) and the
          domestic natural gas distribution infrastructure is deficient to satisfy current and
          future demand, Indonesia has a strong interest in developing alternative technology
          solutions.




                                           92
Perusahaan Listrik Negara, State Electricity Company (PLN) considers CNG marine
transportation as one of the most adequate options. Unlike pipelines and LNG
projects, the great majority of CNG project capital is re-deployable to other
applications if needed, providing a useful risk management solution in case
unexpected events occur in the supply chain, including reservoir, market,
commercial and political risks. Furthermore, projects are easily scalable by adding
vessels. Loading and unloading plants are low capital intense.
 PLN is currently carrying out a pilot stage project, which consists of shipping gas
from Gresik facilities to a receiving point located in Lombok (about 300 nautical
miles from Gresik) via CNG carrier. Two power plant (60 MW) would be fuelled in
order to cover electricity peak demand. The carrier, which will be the world’s first
compressed natural gas, will be built by China to fulfil the order from Pelayaran
Bahtera Adhiguna, a subsidiary of PLN. The ship design has 110 meters length, 14
knots speed and a nominal capacity of 77 MMscf. The CNG carrier is valued at 200
million USD, being the most expensive asset in the supply chain, and it is expected
to be delivered in May 2016.

Marine CNG would allow using cheaper natural gas instead of liquid fuel for power
generation. If the pilot project succeeds, marine CNG technology would be applied
to other power plants across the country, shown in the graph, with similar capacities.

                                  93
         Furthermore, particularly for peak demand, it is necessary to provide a large power
         swing for a short period of time (6 hours a day). This energy could be supplied by
         complementary small thermal power plants which could be fed either by diesel, fuel-
         oil or natural gas.
         Another example of power generation supply by CNG is Maxpower´s project, which
         recently launched the first marine CNG-fuelled power plant. The project, located in
         Bintan island, took two months to be completed and consists of supplying two
         power plants (Type 6) by CNG transported via virtual pipeline (barge or truck). The
         alternative solution represented fuel savings of 35% to Maxpower and an investment
         of 4 MMUSD. This small scale CNG solution could be replicated by other power
         generators, who are currently using gasoline or diesel in the country.


8.4.2.   CNG as fuel for transportation
         Indonesia has been interested on developing natural gas use in transportation for
         more than a decade. The main reasons of the Ministry of Energy´s fuel
         diversification were to reduce oil fuel dependency and to face the rising air pollution
         in the cities.
         Based on PT. Raja Rafa Samudra, Indonesia launched the first NGV program called
         “Blue Sky Program” at the end of 1980s, which consisted in the implementation of
         30 CNG stations across the country (driven by Petramina, Indonesia’s state owned
         Oil & Gas Company). The program failed due to lack of incentives for users (fuel
         was subsided) and high costs of operating stations. Later, in 2005, the private sector
         increased their investments in NGV and industrial CNG business. This time the
         Government supported the initiative with new NGV policies (2007-2011). In
         addition, the Government boosted the deployment of CNG Stations through the
         implementation of the regulation 64/2012 on Supply, Distribution and Pricing of
         Gas for Transport. As a result, in 2012 Petramina launched the first CNG station.
         Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources are currently working on new incentives
         to CNG use.
         Regarding the supply, Envogas (CNG subsidiary of Petramina) and several private
         companies offer CNG supply across the country. Based on Pertamina, the company
         had 13 CNG stations deployed along Java and Sumatra in 2014, and it has targeted
         to build 150 CNG stations annually for 5 years, starting in 2015. This plan includes
         extending the supply to other islands, such as Balikpapan and Sengkang. Also, the
         private sector has several CNG stations deployed in Java and Sumatra. Several of
         these stations are on the grid area, thus, are supplied by the pipeline network;
         however, many of them, called “daughter” stations are supplied by virtual pipeline
         (trucks) from “mother” stations. Based on the Association Perusahaan CNG
         Indonesia (APCNGI) there were 22 CNG mother stations established (plus 5
         planned) and 6 daughter stations among its member companies in 2012.
         According to NGV Global, in 2015, PT Pertamina and PGN signed a memorandum
         of understanding (MOU) in order to cooperate to facilitate natural gas to refuelling
         stations. PGN has already identified 73 fuel stations in Greater Jakarta, which
         intersect the gas pipeline network and, as a result, could be converted to multi fuel
         suppliers (LNG/CNG).




                                         94
          Regarding the demand, the conversion to NGV by users depends on 2 main factors:
          a perdurable gap between petrol and gas prices (which is hindered by current
          subsidies on gasoline and diesel fuels) and a spread availability of CNG filling
          stations. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation launched a program to promote
          the CNG use. According to manufacture experts this policy remains unclear and
          needs time to have significant impact.


8.4.3.   Experience of Jakarta
          Jakarta implemented a pilot project in 1980s, which consisted of installing CNG
          converter kits in 200 local taxis. The project failed due to the lack of availability of
          supply. This issue was explained by the gap of oil and gas prices, which did not
          incentivise the private sector to invest in CNG stations.
          In 2007, Jakarta retook the conversion plan, and started a transition of local
          government fleet and public transportation vehicles to CNG technology. According
          to International Council on Clean Transportation, Jakarta Transportation Agency has
          committed to a full conversion of three-wheeled taxis by the end of 2016, and
          TransJakarta BRT system, which operates 600 CNG buses, has plans to introduce a
          1,000 more. Finally, DKI Jakarta will add 3,000 CNG powered mini buses.
          Regarding the supply, the city had 8 CNG stations in 2012 and had ambitious plans
          to quadruple the number. However, the expectations are not being met, since only 6
          stations were operational from the 10 built in 2014. In addition, Jakarta Department
          of Industry and Energy and a recent MOU between Jakarta Propertindo and
          TransJakarta announced to build 50 and 20 new stations, respectively.
          As it can be noted, Indonesia has decided to progress with the NGV technology and,
          taking into consideration the geography of the country (an archipelago with deficient
          gas transportation network), a significant growth of mother/daughter stations is
          expected in the following years, in order to comply with targets. In this case, trucks
          and vessels carriers would be developed to supply the rest of the islands. It is
          important to note than Jakarta´s stimulus in the NGV field is a main driver for
          Indonesia´s progress on NGV developments.


8.4.4.   CNG as fuel for industrial sector
          CNG has a potential market in the industrial sector, which had contracted 13
          MMscf/d from mother stations supply in North Java by 2012.
          According to CNG-NGV Forum, the industrial sector, and especially the mining
          sector, would be economically benefited by the conversion of conventional fuel to
          CNG. The transportation proposed to these areas is by pipeline or virtual network
          (trucks) in the cases which are not reached by the grid. Several mining companies in
          Sumatra and Kalimantan islands have already switched to CNG/LNG fuel in order
          to reduce their fuel costs.
          Based on the success of these experiences, several industrial clusters could
          implement the conversion of oil to gas fuel in order to make significant savings.

9.        POTENTIAL BARRIERS AND INCENTIVES
              It has been found that the development of CNG is slowed down by several barriers
              such as:
                “The coordination problem” for investment decisions (in terms of infrastructure
                 development).
               The minimum required scale (demand/ supply) in order to assure economic
                 viability.
               The prices that the demand is willing to pay for the new equipment.
              Besides those facing these experiences, there are other countries which have been
              developing interesting and successful projects with CNG technology. Some of these
              practices should be taken into account in future CNG developments in order to
              capitalize on the already acquired knowledge related to the field. In this regard, a
              study of Yeh (2007) has underlined the following policies4:
                 Demand side market creation programs: mandatory conversion of government
                  fleets and urban buses procurement.
                 supply side market creation programs: governmental investments in refueling
                  stations, pipelines and conversion kits.
                 financial incentive programs offered to consumers and equipment suppliers:
                  subsidies and tax breaks to reduce prices of natural gas specifically for
                  transportation, rebates and loans to lower or eliminate consumers’ vehicle
                  conversion costs, exemptions from import duties and the lowering or elimination
                  of import tariffs on machinery, equipment, and kits, and exemption from sales
                  taxes for the construction and operation of refueling stations.
                 Regulation-based policy: industry standards, regulations, and certification
                  programs; liberal licensing for CNG retailing; expedited approvals for the
                  installation of CNG refueling stations; forced early retirement of old fleet
                  vehicles, city buses, and taxis; penalties for operating city buses on ‘‘dirty’’ fuels
                  such as diesel; and traffic restrictions for which NGVs are exempt.
                 Information - or coalition - type policies: government/industry/non-governmental
                  organization (NGO) coalitions and government-funded research and
                  development programs.
                 Interactions between stakeholder groups, such as incentives provided by
                  equipment suppliers to consumers: the voucher scheme developed in New
                  Zealand.




10.           CONCLUSIONS
              CNG is an already proved technology and it has been boosted in several aspects
              since the 1990s.

 4   Yeh, Sonia (2007), “An empirical analysis on the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles: The case of natural gas
              vehicles”, Energy Policy 35, pp. 5865–5875.

      There are economic and environmental reasons to develop CNG in the different
      countries. Regarding the economic aspect, CNG technology is a cost effective
      solution to supply gas to areas which are not reached by the grid and do not reach
      the minimum required volume to invest in a traditional infrastructure.
      Regarding the environmental aspect, crucial in several cities for instance in China,
      emission reduction policies are the main factor to develop this technology, aiming to
      reduce gas flaring and also vehicular emissions.
      The following projects are examples of the main small scale CNG solutions in
      countries like USA and China.
      In order to supply areas that are not reached by the grid, currently, there are several
      projects being developed in USA, such as a virtual pipeline to supply NGV stations
      by mother/daughter system in New York and “CNG in a box” in North Dakota to
      fuel engines on drilling rigs. Also, it should be noted that CNG transportation
      system by vessel has significant advantages over LNG (smaller fixed capital asset),
      and the technology could be sturdily developed to monetize stranded gas. However,
      it is necessary to design a convenient ship that supplies economic and technical
      requirements.
      Additionally, in China there has already been implemented a mother/daughter
      system which has been successful.
      Regarding the flared reduction, an oil company in USA is developing a low-cost
      “CNG Box” in order to supply gas to engines in drilling rigs.
      It is important to note that marine CNG transportation has some benefits compared
      to LNG in terms of costs, due to its lower investment in fixed facilities
      (regasification, liquefaction plants).
      CNG development has to cope with several barriers that slow down its
      popularization as the “coordination problem” or non-competitive prices. In order to
