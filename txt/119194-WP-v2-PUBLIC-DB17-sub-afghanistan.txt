Doing Business 2017
Overview

MAIN FINDINGS

 Where entrepreneurs in Afghanistan establish their
   businesses matters for the regulatory hurdles they face.
   Regulatory quality and efficiency vary across locations
   in the four areas benchmarked—starting a business,
   dealing with construction permits, getting electricity
   and registering property—because of differences in local
   interpretations of the law and in the efficiency of local
   agencies responsible for administering regulation.

 Good practices can be found across Afghanistan in
   all four areas of regulation. Reform-minded policy
   makers can make tangible improvements by replicating
   measures already successfully implemented within the
   country.

 By adopting all the good practices found at the
   subnational level, Afghanistan would move substantially
   closer to the frontier of regulatory best practices—and
   jump 11 places in the global ranking of 190 economies on
   the ease of doing business, moving up from 183 to 172.

4   DOING BUSINESS IN AFGHANISTAN 2017




       BOX 1.1 Recent initiatives to improve the Afghan business regulatory environment

       During 2016 Afghan authorities took important steps toward making it easier to do business. One area of focus was the process
       of starting a business. Before, there were two business licenses: one for import and export activities, issued by the Ministry of
       Commerce and Industries, and one for nontrading activities, issued by the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency. In practice,
       many companies had to obtain both licenses in order to operate. A transition to a new licensing system, with a single business
       license, started in Kabul in late 2016. The changes were progressively rolled out to the provinces beyond the capital.

       The new license is to be issued for a period of three years. The changes benefit all local companies, but particularly those operat-
       ing outside Kabul, where both types of licenses had to be renewed yearly under the old system (for more details, see the chapter
       on starting a business).

       The new licensing system could potentially make the start-up process faster and easier—though also more expensive.
       Implementing regulatory changes across different locations presents many challenges. Once the implementation is complete, it
       will be possible to assess the full impact of the changes.

       Efforts have also been made to improve the process of obtaining construction permits. Recent changes in this area were focused
       in Kabul (see figure). A new regulatory framework was introduced, with a modern set of standard operating procedures and of-
       ficial time limits. A one-stop shop bringing together different municipal offices was set up, along with a web-based service. The
       initiative also included training for 75 technical staff members at the Kabul municipality and an awareness campaign directed at
       construction practitioners and other stakeholders.

       The initiative focused on residential and high-rise commercial construction. The next step could be to make the process more
       efficient for all types of construction, including smaller commercial buildings such as the one in the Doing Business case study, as
       well as to reduce the cost of obtaining building permits (for more details, see the chapter on dealing with construction permits).

    Note: Rankings for the four areas measured are based on the distance to frontier (DTF) score, which shows how far a province is from the best performance achieved by
    any economy on each Doing Business indicator. The distance to frontier score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices

    Afghanistan’s public sector is highly centralized. The central administration consists of around 54 government units—including
    ministries, departments, agencies and independent directorates. Central government ministries and institutions are consid-
    ered primary budget units. Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, which vary widely in population size, are not designated budget units.
    Services at the provincial level are delivered by line ministries, agencies and provincial administrations.
    Provincial offices generally have limited staff and capacity, and there are often overlapping roles and responsibilities, including
    between provincial governors (appointed by the president of Afghanistan), line ministries and provincial councils (directly elect-
    ed by citizens). Provincial councils exercise only limited oversight over the provincial governors and provincial line departments.
    In 2016 the Ministry of Finance prepared a provincial budget policy—now approved by the Cabinet of Ministers—that could
    greatly enhance the role of provincial line departments and administrations in both planning and budget execution.a Resolving
    the ambiguity around the overlapping authority of line ministries and provincial governors over provincial line departments
    would help clarify the subnational governance framework and strengthen the legitimacy and accountability of the public sector.
    However, efforts to move service delivery toward the provincial level need to take into consideration transparency issues at this
    level as well as provincial capacity to deliver.
    The Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG), established by a presidential decree in August 2007, is responsible for
    the overall system of intergovernmental relations, including provincial, district, village and municipal affairs. Within the IDLG, the
    General Directorate for Municipal Affairs is responsible for managing municipal affairs. Municipalities are constitutionally recog-
    nized as local government entities, created to manage urban affairs, and therefore have their own budgets. They are largely self-
    sustained entities that fund the provision of urban services through local revenue collection. But they face capacity constraints in
    delivering services to growing urban populations. Mayors are centrally appointed, and budgets centrally approved. The Kabul mu-
    nicipality has a special legal and political status: it is independent from the IDLG and reports directly to the Office of the President.

Note: The figure illustrates the distribution of the 190 economies in the Doing Business sample by their distance to frontier score for each indicator set. The higher the concentration
of economies with a certain distance to frontier score, the greater the width. The distance to frontier score shows how far an economy is from the best performance achieved by any
economy on each Doing Business indicator. The measure is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better).

About Doing Business
and Doing Business in
Afghanistan 2017

 Doing Business measures aspects of business regulation
   affecting domestic small and medium-size firms in
   11 areas across 190 economies. Doing Business in
   Afghanistan 2017 covers 4 of these areas: starting a
   business, dealing with construction permits, getting
   electricity and registering property.

 Doing Business and Doing Business in Afghanistan
   2017 do not capture other aspects of the business
   environment, such as security, market size,
   macroeconomic stability and the prevalence of bribery
   and corruption.

 The Doing Business methodology is based on
   standardized case scenarios in the largest business city
   of each economy. Subnational Doing Business studies
   expand the Doing Business analysis beyond this largest
   business city to measure variations in regulations or in
   the implementation of national laws across locations
   within an economy or a region. Doing Business in
   Afghanistan 2017 relies on the following main sources
   of information: the relevant laws and regulations, private
   sector respondents, government officials, court officials
   and World Bank Group staff.

 Doing Business includes a gender dimension in 4 of the
   11 indicator sets. Starting a business, registering property
   and enforcing contracts present a gender dimension for
   the first time in the Doing Business 2017 report. Labor
   market regulation already captured gender-disaggregated
   data in the Doing Business 2016 report.

NOTES

1.	   Data from the World Bank Enterprise
      Surveys and Doing Business complement
      each other as two sides of the same coin.
      They both provide useful information on the
      business environment of an economy, but
      in significantly different ways. The scope of
      Doing Business is narrower than the Enterprise
      Surveys. However, by focusing on actionable
      indicators related to business regulation,
      Doing Business provides a clear roadmap
      for governments to improve. Doing Business
      uses standardized case scenarios while
      the Enterprise Surveys use representative
      samples. For more on the Enterprise Surveys
      and the differences between the Enterprise
      Surveys and Doing Business, see the website at

      proportionally, according to their contribution
      to the total score, with a weight of 60%
      assigned to the strength of legal rights index
      and 40% to the depth of credit information
      index. In this way each point included in these
      indexes has the same value independent of
      the component it belongs to. Indicators for all
      other topics are assigned equal weights.

      Principal components and unobserved
      components methods yield a ranking nearly
      identical to that from the simple average
      method because both these methods assign
      roughly equal weights to the topics, since the
      pairwise correlations among indicators do
      not differ much. An alternative to the simple
      average method is to give different weights to
      the topics, depending on which are considered
      of more or less importance in the context of a
      specific economy.

Starting a Business

MAIN FINDINGS

 Afghanistan has made important strides since 2008
   in simplifying the start-up process. Today the country
   ranks among the top 50 economies worldwide on the
   ease of starting a business.

 Recent changes aimed at abolishing dual licensing
   requirements for local businesses have the potential
   to make the start-up process more efficient across the
   country—though also more costly.

 Among the five provinces benchmarked, starting
   a business is easier in Kabul than in the other four.
   The main reason is that one-stop shops for business
   registration have not yet spread beyond the capital.

 In these four provinces the lack of a one-stop shop
   means that starting a business requires twice as many
   procedures. But the process still takes the same amount
   of time as in Kabul and less than in Karachi, Pakistan, or
   in Mumbai, India.

24   DOING BUSINESS IN AFGHANISTAN 2017




        BOX 3.1 The government is taking an important step forward by abolishing the dual licensing system for
        businesses
        The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA), created by the government in 2003, has been responsible for issuing and
        renewing investment licenses, required for all domestic and foreign companies doing business in the country. In parallel, the
        Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MoCI) has issued trade licenses for those considered to be foreign traders.

        On September 28, 2016, however, MoCI announced reforms aimed at streamlining business licensing in Afghanistan by abol-
        ishing the dual licensing requirements for domestic businesses. The investment license issued by AISA and the trade license
        issued by MoCI are being replaced with a single business license administered by the Afghanistan Central Business Registry
        and Intellectual Property (ACBRIP) general directorate. The new license is to be issued for a period of three years. The changes
        benefit all local companies, but they particularly benefit those operating outside Kabul, where the trade and investment licenses
        both had to be renewed yearly under the old system. The cost of the new license is to be a lump sum of AFN 30,000 (US$503)—
        significantly higher than the cost of the investment license.

        AISA’s licensing operations were merged into ACBRIP between October 1 and December 31, 2016, first in Kabul and then
        progressively in the other provinces.a In Kabul, where there is a one-stop shop for business registration, the changes have
        the potential to reduce the time required to start a business because there are now fewer agencies in the back office. But the
        impact could be even more significant in the other provinces: if the changes are implemented efficiently, they would allow an
        entrepreneur to get the license and register the new company in a single visit to the local ACBRIP branch, cutting the number
        of interactions by three.

        BOX 3.2 Women in Afghanistan comply with additional requirements for starting a business
        In 155 economies around the world, women do not have the same legal rights and supportive environment vital for promoting
        entrepreneurship that men do. Evidence shows that economies where female entrepreneurs face more gender-related obstacles
        to engaging in economic activities tend to perform worse on important economic and social indicators. Globally, if all women
        were excluded from the labor force, income per capita would be reduced by almost 40%. In South Asia gender gaps in entrepre-
        neurship and labor force participation lead to an estimated income loss of 19%.a

        In 2016 Doing Business added gender-related measures to account for gender-related differences in doing business. For start-
        ing a business, Doing Business now explores whether a woman must obtain permission to leave the house; whether there are
        gender-specific identification procedures; and whether a married woman must obtain her husband’s permission to start a busi-
        ness. Twenty-three economies have laws in place imposing one or more of these additional hurdles on women,b and for these
        economies Doing Business now records additional procedures, time or cost. Afghanistan is among this group, with one such
        hurdle (see figure). In Afghanistan, by law, if a married woman leaves the house without her husband’s permission, the husband
        can withdraw his financial support.c Such laws undermine women’s bargaining power within the household and can hamper their
        ability to pursue a business venture.d

would be expected given its high
distance to frontier score. As measured by this score, its average performance in the ease of starting a business is comparable to
that of OECD high-income economies like Germany or Poland. Yet in 2012, the latest year for which comparable data are avail-
able, Afghanistan had only 15 newly registered businesses per 100,000 working-age adults. Other economies in South Asia with
less efficient start-up processes had far higher numbers, such as Sri Lanka (51) and Nepal (69).a

An efficient start-up process is no guarantee of a high density of new businesses. While regulatory entry barriers in Afghanistan
are low, entrepreneurs may face other challenges to running a local business. Lack of basic infrastructure such as grid power
could be one of them. Only 43% of the Afghan population is connected to the national grid, far lower than the regional average
for South Asia of 78%.b The country’s total energy demand is estimated at around 2,500 megawatts, while its power system is
capable of servicing a peak demand of only 750 megawatts.c Businesses report 11.5 electricity outages per month on average,
with a typical outage lasting 2.6 hours.d Many supplement power from the national grid with expensive but dependable alterna-
tives such as private generators.

Conflict and security conditions can also deter entrepreneurs. Decades of conflict and international migration have left a sub-
stantial gap in Afghanistan’s human capital development. In 2011 only one in three Afghan adults was considered literate.e The
shortage of skilled labor makes it difficult for new enterprises to find qualified staff. Hiring women can be particularly challeng-
ing, because they often need their family’s permission to take on certain jobs or even to leave their home. Security risks may
discourage new investments because firms must absorb the additional cost of operating in a fragile and politically uncertain
environment. In a 2014 survey of manufacturing firms in Afghanistan, 30% reported paying for personal security while 17% re-
ported experiencing losses due to theft and vandalism.f These structural challenges may discourage entrepreneurs from starting
a business in the first place.

Dealing with
Construction Permits

MAIN FINDINGS

 On average in the five Afghan provinces surveyed,
   completing the construction permitting process for
   a simple warehouse takes five weeks less than the
   regional average for South Asia—but it costs more than
   twice as much as a share of the value of the warehouse.

 Among the five provinces, Kandahar has the fastest and
   least costly process, requiring around three months and
   28.4% of the value of the warehouse. In Kabul it takes
   almost nine months longer and costs three times as
   much.

 Among the main constraints to greater efficiency
   and quality in construction permitting in Afghanistan
   are fragmented and outdated regulations and poor
   transparency. This situation sustains the alarming rates
   of illegal construction in the country.

BOX 4.1 The building quality control index—going beyond efficiency

The building quality control index assesses the quality of construction regulations and controls in six main areas (for a possible
15 points): quality of building regulations (2 points); quality control before (1 point), during (3 points) and after construction (3
points); liability and insurance regimes (2 points); and professional certifications (4 points). Kabul receives a score of 2.5 on the
building quality control index, while the other four provinces receive a score of only 2 (see table).

important construction projects, these inspections are neither legally mandated nor consistently applied in all cases (0 points).

Final inspections after construction are neither legally mandated nor commonly carried out in practice (0 points). In contrast,
final inspections are mandatory in all other South Asian economies except Maldives—and in most economies globally.

Structural defects in a building are often discovered only after it has been occupied. In most economies liability is shared be-
tween the contractor and the architect, and in some economies insurance is mandatory. The civil code of Afghanistan specifies
the liability requirements for structural defects (1 point). But there is no legal obligation to obtain an insurance policy to cover
possible defects (0 points). Among South Asian economies, only Pakistan (Karachi) has both the liability and insurance regimes
in place for covering possible structural flaws.

It is important that professionals involved in the permitting process have the necessary technical qualifications. Afghanistan
lacks formal regulations specifying the qualification requirements for the technical professionals who review the drawings (0
points) or supervise the construction on site (0 points). All other South Asian economies except Sri Lanka have at least the
minimum qualification requirements in place for these professionals. Globally, around 75% of economies require some level of
professional certification.


a. Article 35 of the Municipality Law of 2000 specifies that the duties of the agency responsible for implementing the master plan include “monitoring
of the construction site according to the master plan.” Article 40 of the same law suggests that supervision of the project by the designer and technical
control of the project “should be considered during construction.” These are the only legal provisions at the national level that regulate the quality
control processes during construction.

Getting Electricity

MAIN FINDINGS

 On average in the five Afghan provinces surveyed,
   getting an electricity connection takes three weeks less
   than the regional average for South Asia. But it costs
   almost 70% more as a share of income per capita.
   One substantial expense is the substation distribution
   transformer, which because of insufficient capacity
   needs to be purchased and installed in the vast majority
   of cases.

 Among the five Afghan provinces, it is easiest to
   obtain an electricity connection in Kabul, where the
   headquarters of the state distribution utility are located.

 While all five Afghan provinces receive a score of 0 on
   a Doing Business measure of the reliability of electricity
   supply, power shortages are particularly severe in the
   South, which lacks connectivity with the rest of the
   country and with potential exporting states.

    BOX 5.1 The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index—going beyond efficiency
    Introduced by Doing Business in 2015, the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index measures the quality of service
    provided by utilities as it relates to stability in distribution and clarity of information provided on consumption costs. The scoring
    is based on six main components, for a possible 8 points: reliability of supply (3 points), mechanisms for monitoring outages (1
    point), mechanisms for restoring service (1 point), regulatory monitoring (1 point), financial deterrents aimed at limiting outages
    (1 point) and transparency of consumption tariffs (1 point).

    Doing Business uses the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) and the system average interruption frequency index
    (SAIFI) to measure the duration and frequency of power outages. SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the course of a
    year per customer served, while SAIFI is the average number of service interruptions experienced by a customer in a year. An economy
    is eligible to obtain a score on the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index if the utility collects SAIDI and SAIFI data and if
    the SAIDI value is below a threshold of 100 hours and the SAIFI value below a threshold of 100 outages. An economy receives a score
    of 0 on the overall index if it does not compute SAIDI and SAIFI, even if the economy scores points on any other component. Afghan
    provinces do not record SAIDI and SAIFI and so receive a score of 0 on the overall index (see table).
                                                                                                                                                              (continued)

       BOX 5.1 The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index—going beyond efficiency (continued)
       For monitoring outages, 1 point is assigned if the utility uses automated tools such as the supervisory control and data acquisi-
       tion (SCADA) system. Similarly, for restoring service 1 point is again assigned for the use of automated tools. The provinces
       of Herat, Kandahar and Nangarhar do not use automated tools, while Balkh and Kabul use SCADA, though only at the level of
       transmission, not distribution.a

       For regulatory monitoring, the scoring depends on whether an economy has an independent regulator that monitors power out-
       ages and requires the utility to report on reliability of supply. Afghanistan’s Electrical Energy Services Regulating Law assigns the
       role of regulator to the Ministry of Electricity and Water. But this ministry owns 35% of DABS and therefore does not qualify as
       independent.

       Doing Business assigns 1 point if the utility compensates customers when outages exceed a certain cap or if the utility is fined by
       the regulator when this happens. Afghan regulation does not require such measures.

       Finally, 1 point is assigned if electricity tariffs are available online and customers are notified of a change in tariff a full billing cycle
       (one month) ahead of time. All DABS offices notify customers of tariff changes ahead of time, but none of the five provinces have
       the tariffs available online, so all receive a score of 0 on this component.

       These results pinpoint possible areas of improvement in Afghanistan. For lessons of experience, it could look to the example
       of neighboring countries with high scores on the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index—such as Uzbekistan (8)
       or India (7)—or to other developing economies that have put in place reliable and transparent systems, such as Guatemala or
       Indonesia.

         All Afghan provinces receive a score of 0 on the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index

        Note: If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12 (equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an outage of
        one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is

       a. While data on outages are recorded at every substation in Afghanistan, these data are not publicly available. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in
       Herat, for example, there are at least two outages a day, totaling 3.0–4.5 hours. In Nangarhar the power is off at least 4 hours a day. The situation is
       even more critical in Kandahar, where electricity is available only 4 hours a day on average. Where electricity supply is unreliable, firms have to invest in
       costly back-up solutions. Many rely on diesel generators, incurring high capital costs as well as high costs for electricity (averaging around 25–30 US$
       cents per kilowatt-hour). Beyond these costs, firms using diesel generators must invest in fuel storage facilities, fuel procurement arrangements and
       protection against fuel theft.

        BOX 5.2 Structure of the Afghan supply system
        The Afghan electricity distribution system is formed by more than 10 isolated networks of different sizes and technical layouts.
        Each of the networks is supplied by separate power systems, with distinct synchronizations and voltages. These differences and
        the physical distance between the networks inhibit interconnections among grids, limit country-wide distribution and make the
        load dispatching inflexible. According to conservative estimates, national demand was around 1,500 megawatts in 2015 while
        the system is capable of serving a peak demand of only 750 megawatts. An estimated 24% of electricity is lost in transmission
        and distribution.a

        Nearly 80% of all grid consumption is imported while domestic power generation capacities remain stagnant. As a result, tariffs
        are influenced by changes in energy prices in the exporting economies. The provinces of Balkh, Kabul and Nangarhar import
        power from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Herat imports from Turkmenistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Balkh, which imports
        100% of its electricity, has consumption tariffs driven by price fluctuations in the exporting countries. Kandahar imports no
        electricity because its grid is not connected to potential exporting countries, and has to rely entirely on self-generated energy.

        Of the national domestic power generation, 50% is hydropower while the rest is based on fossil fuel (mainly diesel), which is
        more expensive. Kandahar has the highest ratio of diesel power. Provinces with a balance of self-generated and imported power,
        such as Kabul, have more room for strategic adjustment of their tariff policies.

            began in 1994. Private power producers now
            provide about 30% of generation capacity.
            The distribution sector is operated by 10 state-
            owned regional utilities and a private company,
            K-Electric, which serves Karachi. Almost all
            the utilities face the same set of challenges:
            shortfalls in electricity supply, chronic
            transmission and distribution losses, and
            insufficient exploitation of existing capacity.
            The electricity regulator (the National Electric
            Power Regulatory Authority, or NEPRA) was
            established in 1998 as an autonomous body
            with no government administrative control.
            But while NEPRA has jurisdiction over tariffs,
            all decisions need to be approved by the state.
            Successive governments have set end-user
            tariffs below the cost of supply, covering the
            difference through extensive government
            subsidies paid to the utility. Delays in
            disbursing these subsidies have at times
            strained the finances of generation companies,
            undermining investments and the upkeep of
            the distribution network.
Registering Property

MAIN FINDINGS

 Faced with the challenge of having less than 30% of
   urban land formally registered, Afghanistan remains one
   of the most difficult places globally to transfer land.

 There is potential to do better. Data show that
   transferring property takes only 2.5 months in Kandahar,
   compared with more than 8 months in Kabul.

 Procedural complexity, low levels of transparency and
   lack of adequate record-keeping infrastructure are some
   of the major obstacles to improving the reliability of the
   land administration system.

        WHAT DOES REGISTERING PROPERTY MEASURE?
        Doing Business records the full sequence of procedures necessary for a business (the buyer) to purchase a property from another
        business (the seller) and to transfer the property title to the buyer’s name so that the buyer can use the property for expand-
        ing its business, use the property as collateral in taking new loans or, if necessary, sell the property to another business. It also
        measures the time and cost to complete each of these procedures. In addition, Doing Business measures the quality of the land
        administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has five dimensions: reliability of infrastructure,
        transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution and equal access to property rights (see figure).

       BOX 6.1 The quality of land administration index—going beyond efficiency
       Good land administration is not just efficient. It ensures property owners a secure title, backed by a reliable land administration system.
       The quality of such a system, as measured by Doing Business, depends on four main factors, each scored for the quality of land admin-
       istration index: reliability of infrastructure (8 points); transparency and public availability of records (6 points); geographic coverage of
       the registry and mapping agency (8 points); and accessibility of conflict resolution mechanisms for land-related disputes (8 points) (see
       figure).

       Where land registries do not provide
       complete geographic coverage, compa-
       nies and individuals cannot be sure whether the areas not covered are relevant to their interests.c Globally, only 27% of economies have
       a registry with full coverage of private land—and only 34% a cadastre with complete coverage. Afghanistan has not achieved full cover-
       age, so receives a score of 0. It is estimated that only a third of its land has been surveyed, with a higher share in urban areas.d Geographic
       conditions, inadequate technology and lack of a stable government are among the main challenges.

       Accuracy of information in land registries and property transactions helps avoid potential disputes. In Afghanistan all property transac-
       tions need to be registered to make them opposable to third parties (1.5 points) and the system is subject to guarantee (0.5 points), as
       in 148 other economies. Responsibility for verifying the legality of the documents and the identities of the parties falls to the courts (1
       point). When land-related disputes do arise, they are handled by district primary courts, with delays varying by location. Resolution of a
       land dispute in the courts in Balkh is fast, taking less than one year (3 points). By contrast, it takes more than a year in Herat, Kandahar
       and Nangarhar (1 point) and more than three years in Kabul (0 points).

       In 2016 Doing Business added a gender component to the quality of land administration index, differentiating ownership rights—the
       ability to manage, control, administer, access, encumber, receive, dispose of and transfer property—for men and women. Scoring for this
       new component assesses whether there is differential treatment of men and women in the law, considering the default marital property

   Economy characteristics
   Gross national income per capita
   Doing Business in Afghanistan 2017 reports 2015 income per capita as published in the World Bank’s World Development
   Indicators 2016. Income is calculated using the Atlas method (in current U.S. dollars). For cost indicators expressed as a per-
   centage of income per capita, 2015 gross national income (GNI) per capita in current U.S. dollars is used as the denominator.
   Afghanistan’s income per capita for 2015 is US$630 (AFN 37,599).

   Region and income group
   Doing Business uses the World Bank regional and income group classifications, available at http://data.worldbank.org/about/
   country-and-lending-groups. Regional averages presented in figures and tables in the Doing Business in Afghanistan 2017
   report include economies from all income groups (low, lower middle, upper middle and high income), though high-income
   OECD economies are assigned the “regional” classification OECD high income.

   Exchange rate
   The exchange rate used in the Doing Business in Afghanistan 2017 report is: US$1 = 59.7 Afghani (AFN).
