                      This note forms part of the Rapid Technology Skills Technical Assistance
                      (“Decoding Bootcamps”) initiative by the World Bank, which aims to co-
                      llect and share examples and lessons of bootcamps in emerging markets,
                      and measure the impact of bootcamp training on youth employment in
                      selected countries.

                      The program seeks to establish a framework of best practice for future
                      projects in technology upskilling in the developing world. The initiative has
                      been piloted in three countries: Colombia, Kenya, and Lebanon. It includes
                      this information note, which offers background on coding bootcamps, as
                      well as a forthcoming publication on the impact evaluation and a policy
                      guide. This initiative would not have been possible without the award of a
                      grant from the World Bank’s Jobs Umbrella Trust Fund, which is supported
                      by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, and

INTRODUCTION
This report provides an overview of coding bootcamps with a focus on emerging economies. It provides practical examples
of how these coding bootcamps are being implemented in developing countries and their connection to entrepreneurial
ecosystems and new tech-related job opportunities.

of fast-growing technology companies in North America. The first movers were General Assembly and Dev Bootcamp in NYC

MAIN PRINCIPLES
OF CODING BOOTCAMPS
Coding bootcamps are intensive short-term programs designed to train participants in programming skills to make them
immediately employable in entry-level tech positions (Meng 2013). In essence, they combine characteristics of traditional
vocational training programs with the intensity of military bootcamps for new recruits, intermingling socioemotional and
tech skills learning in an intense manner, in what could be referred to as “skills accelerators.”

Coding bootcamps follow a structured process           ing on online applications and interviews. At first,    Competitive application processes aim to screen

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
CODING BOOTCAMPS
Coding bootcamps mainly differ according to their business model, course structure, and employability outcomes.
International coding bootcamps that have partnerships with well-established U.S. or Canadian bootcamps (or act under their
franchise internationally) tend to adopt similar programmatic activities and course content, and have similar employability
results.

MAIN CHALLENGES
OF CODING BOOTCAMPS
The impact of coding bootcamps could be limited because of the challenges of affordability, retention, or even in terms
of expansion. In many cases, the fee for taking part in a coding bootcamp is an impediment for low-income or even
middle-income population segments, in particular in the absence of student loans or other financial instruments.

CRITICISM AND NEED FOR
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH
High employability and employment rates reported by coding bootcamps suggest an untapped potential of this form of
rapid tech skills training program. However, early evidence, which is based on a limited number of sources – mostly based
on data from bootcamp providers themselves – calls for additional, more representative, holistic, and independent research.

EXAMPLES OF POLICY
INTERVENTIONS
The private sector alone is unlikely to tackle structural unemployment issues and the related lack of technology skills in
emerging economies. The challenges outlined above and the existence of a variety of business models of bootcamps attest
to the fact that there is a niche to be filled by the public sector, civil society, and international donors, particularly with regard
to inclusion of the underprivileged population and those with lower skills.

Tech Makers in Medellín was supported by the
World Bank and Ruta N to offer high subsidies
for trainees from low-income segments, which
has enabled a significant increase in participation
from income strata 1 and 2 of the population (see
Box 8).

Through public-private partnerships, policy
makers can also encourage and lower the risk
for private-sector employers to test the hiring of
bootcamp graduates from all backgrounds for
low entry-level tech jobs. In Kenya for example,
several tech start-ups that hire from the Moringa
School revealed in discussions with the authors
of this report that they pay little attention to the
formal education background of candidates,
rather focusing on testing their ability to do the
job and continuously grow and learn.

However, many more traditional companies still
place greater emphasis on formal education
even though they report a dissatisfaction with
the skill quality of university graduates. Such a
partnership may encourage employers to shift
their hiring practices towards a more efficient and
more inclusive approach. For example, the U.S.

Hack Reactor is a for-profit company that operates a coding bootcamp in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and New York
City, as well as a remote online bootcamp. Hack Reactor partners with Moringa school in Kenya and ReBootKAMP, RBK, a
bootcamp supporting Syrian refuges across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). In providing expertise and curriculum
support, these partnerships have been instrumental in kickstarting the creation of these bootcamps in emerging economies.

Laboratoria is a coding bootcamp and a continuing education program that combines applied coding education,
psychological training, and deep employer engagement to create opportunities for students. The bootcamp has four
locations within Latin America that target low-income women from 18 to 35 years of age. Laboratoria is a social venture
where students pay for the program in low monthly installments, but after they have completed the six-month bootcamp
and only when they have a secured job.

with software engineering in an education-to-employment model. Nairobi-based Moringa School accepts students from all
over Africa and operates as a for-profit entity. The technical curriculum, which includes Android, Ruby on Rails, UI and UX,
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was developed based on local market needs, taking into account best practices of Hack Reactor
and Epicodus, leading U.S. coding bootcamps, to ensure that the quality of Moringa graduates is world-class.

SE Factory (Software Engineering Factory) is a Beirut-based, Lebanese coding bootcamp that teaches the technical and
socioemotional skills necessary for professional full-stack web development. The motivation to found the SE Factory boot-
camp was rooted in trying to solve a two-fold problem in the Lebanese tech scene: on one hand, companies face the
shortage of developers, and on the other hand, computer science graduates (especially those from second-tier universities)
lack the skills to find employment as software engineers.

Coderise is a Colombia-based bootcamp that seeks to empower high-school students by teaching them how to build web
applications. A nonprofit organization operating in Medellín, Coderise teaches web development to promote upward social
mobility in developing countries. According to Andrea Cornejo, the bootcamp founder, the program was a response to the
lack of opportunities available for young people. Coderise teaches not only web development, but also critical thinking and
the ability to solve complex problems.

2. There are diverse definitions that refer to the broad concept of socioemotional
skills. Heckman and Kautz (2013) suggest that all of them refer to the same con-
cept and that they are often used interchangeably. The authors have used the term
socioemotional skills to refer to all the terms within the same conceptual space
(such as noncognitive skills, soft skills or life skills).
