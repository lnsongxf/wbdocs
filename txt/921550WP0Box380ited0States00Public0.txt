THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       filing the company's articles of organization. To reserve a name, the
       founders should file an application for Reservation of Name and pay a
       fee of USD 20. The application holds the name for 60 days and may be
       extended twice for additional periods of 60 days. The fee to extend the
       reservation of name is also USD 20. The company name must contain

        A fee of $165 is paid for each PW1 filing. BuildCo has a choice of
        paying half of this amount with PW1 filing, and the remaining balance

      Request and obtain plan approval from the New York City
      Department of Buildings (DOB)

      The applicant must be either a Registered Architect (RA) or a
      Professional Engineer (PE) to submit the plans. The Department of
      Buildings (DOB) reviews construction plans to ensure that they comply
      with the Building Code and meet current safety standards and zoning
      requirements. Once plans are approved, a contractor or contractor’s
      representative may apply for a construction work permit.

      Simple projects, as in the case of BuildCo, can opt for a fast-track
      service offered by the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB),
      called the Professional Certification Program. The program, introduced
      in 1996, enables registered architects and professional engineers to
      certify, through an affidavit signed by the owner, contractor, and all
      responsible professionals (architects, engineers, plumbers, and the like)
      that the plans they file with the department are in compliance with all
      applicable laws. This reduces the amount of time a builder normally
      would wait for a DOB permit by eliminating the process of DOB
      examination and approval of the plans.

      The professional certification must be submitted at the time of pre-
      filing and in advance. A professionally certified application goes
      through the same pre-filing, payment, and data entry process as
      normal applications:
      • Information on the availability of a public sewer system
      • If a private sewage treatment plant is proposed, evidence of
      submission of plans for approval of such a plant to the department of        21 days      USD 3,640
2
      environmental protection and the department of health as required by
      law
      • The lot diagram showing compliance with the zoning resolution
      • The foundation plans
      • The floor and roof plans showing compliance with exit requirements
      • The detailed architectural, structural, and mechanical drawings
      • General description of the proposed work

      After analyzing the plans (assuming that all required documents are
      present), the DOB approves the application at the end of data entry.

      A professionally certified application does not go through plan
      examination. The applicant can check the application status by using
      the Buildings Information System and, upon approval, can retrieve the
      application folder from the DOB to apply for a permit. Twenty percent
      of all professionally certified applications are selected for audit within
      10 days of first permit issuance. The audits for new projects may take
      place within 30 days after the application is issued.

      The overall time of application clearance is 5 days on average.

      According to the 2008 Building Code No. 26-212, the fee for the new
      building permit is USD 0.26 per square foot. The plumbing permit and
      foundation fee are calculated inside the above flat rate.

      The Building Code says that "fifty percent of the total fee for the work
      permit, but not less than one hundred dollars, or the total fee for the
      work permit where such fee is less than one hundred dollars, shall be

                                                                                   complete
      paid by or on behalf of the owner or lessee of the building premises or
      property affected, and shall accompany the first application for the
      approval of plans or other statement describing the building work
      when submitted prior to submission of the permit application; and the
      whole or remainder of the total fee shall be paid before the work
      permit may be issued.” Still, most companies of BuildCo’s size would
      opt to pay the amount upfront, not in two separate transactions. Only
      for large projects is dividing the amount widespread.

      Starting in 2011, the NYC Department of Buildings began accepting
      digital plans for new buildings. While our contributors have noted that
      the processing time isn't any faster in practice than submitting in
      person, it does allow the applicant more project control and improved
      accessibility to the plan examiner and inter-agency communications, as
      well as online tracking of application progress.

      Obtain work permit from the Department of Buildings (DOB)

      After obtaining the Building permit, the company must request a work
      permit. The request should be accompanied by a copy of the current
      insurance policy of workers’ compensation insurance. This procedure
      must be done by the contractor even if they are not the owner of the
      land. Different types of work require separate licenses. However, in one
      application, more than one permit can be requested. For instance,
      plumbing and construction work permits can be requested in the same
      application.

      For a warehouse, BuildCo must request a new building permit, a
      plumbing permit, and a foundation and earthwork permit. The request
      must include the detailed architectural, structural, and mechanical
      plans. One to two days prior to construction works, the company must
      notify the DOB by phone.

      buys another work permit for the remaining period of construction.
      Upon applying, the company gets an account number, and the next day

      Request occupancy certificate from the Department of Buildings
      (DOB)

      Upon completion of construction, the company must arrange for DOB
      inspections. For construction and plumbing, the company should
      contact the borough office where property is located.

      After completion of satisfactory inspections and submission of the
      required fillings (including inspections reports), DOB issues a new
      certificate of occupancy that describes the legal use and occupancy of a
      property.

      Each application must be accompanied by an accurate and complete
      lot survey made by a licensed surveyor. If the certificate of occupancy
      application is not signed by a professional engineer or registered
      architect, the form must be notarized by an official notary public.

      To obtain the certificate of occupancy, the company must obtain the           1 day        no charge
11
      work permit/approval from the Bureau of Electrical Control, the
      Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of
      Transportation. If these approvals have not yet been granted at the
      time of applying for the certificate of occupancy, a temporary certificate
      can be issued. The company then has a year to obtain all the necessary
      approvals.

      If the building does not comply with all the plans and the New York
      City building code, the company must make the necessary changes.
      Then the Department of Buildings inspects the warehouse again. This
      process is repeated until the building complies with all the rules. It is
      common to have 2 -- 3 inspections of this sort. Once the building
      passes the inspection, the issuance of the certificate of occupancy is
      immediate.

      Receive building plan check and permit

      Building plans are screened for completeness and accuracy. An option
      to expedite the plan check is available for an expedite fee of 50% of the
      plan check fee. Plans that are expedited are usually handled in 5
      calendar days, as expedited plans can include weekend work, instead of
      the normal 3-4 week waiting period.

      Smaller projects such as tenant improvements and small offices may
      receive a counter plan check that takes only 45-60 minutes.

      Building plans must be submitted to the Department of Building and
      Safety, including:
      • Description of the work to be covered by the permit.
      • Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done,
      and the street address.
      • Description of the use for which the proposed work is intended.
      • Two sets of site plans, including all boundaries, lot lines, existing and
      proposed buildings and structures, neighboring public ways, and
      dimensions.
      • Valuation of any new building.
      • Be signed by the permittee, or an authorized agent.
      • Give such other data and information as may be required by the
      Superintendent of Building.

      Building plan checks include electrical, mechanical, disabled access and
      structural plan checks. Grading plan checks may also be required if the
      location is in a hillside area. Mechanical plan checks may also be             5 days      USD 48,646

      required when there are HVAC systems or elevators required. HVAC
      systems may be required if the building is in the desert areas, but
      would not be required in the beach or basin areas. BuildCo's warehouse
      is also not likely to require an elevator, according to the CBC Title 42
      Chapter 11B, because it is fewer than three stories, and "a reasonable
      portion of [the] facilities and accommodations normally sought by the
      public... are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities."

      * Bonded plumber applies for and receives sewer connection
      permit.

      A sewer permit is required for all new connections to sewers. This is an
      over-the-counter permit and can be issued in as little as 30 minutes.

      In order to issue an S-Permit, BuildCo must identify the address of the
      property and work. This will be verified by the Bureau of Engineering
      (BOE) staff, and they will confirm the availability of the main line sewer.
      Furthermore, the BOE District Office where the project is located must
      be identified, in case the District Engineer’s input is required.

        The customer or their contractor should consult Con Edison regarding

        connected to the company's distribution system. Information the

      The connection point should be on the customer's land and within a

      Electrician requests and receives internal wiring inspection from NY
      Buildings Dept.

      The NY Building Dept Electric division inspector does the internal and
      external wiring inspection once all wiring and connections are final. This
      step is usually carried out after electricity has been turned on, and is not
      a requirement to obtain supply. It is required however in order to obtain
3     an occupancy permit. If the inspector finds that everything is ok, he         7 calendar days         USD 380
      submits his report to the clerk in the NY Buildings office, who files it, and
      then publishes the Certificate of Completion online on the NY Buildings
      Website. This is usually done on the same day or next business day after
      inspection.
      The actual application for Certificate of Internal Inspection is done by the
      electrician before internal wiring commences. The Dept of Buildings then
      issues a Control Number to the electrician.

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
