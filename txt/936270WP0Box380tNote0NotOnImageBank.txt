                                 1.      Results and Performance of the WBG (RAP) is the annual account of the
                                 effectiveness of the World Bank Group (WBG, including International Bank for
                                 Reconstruction and Development -IBRD/International Development Association -IDA,
                                 International Finance Corporation - IFC, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency -
                                 MIGA) in addressing current and emerging development challenges. The report builds on
                                 evidence synthesized from recent IEG evaluations complemented by relevant information
                                 from other sources. RAP 2014 will be the fifth in a series that began in 2010. As the
                                 methodology for the RAP is established, in lieu of an Approach Paper, this Concept Note
                                 outlines the context and rationale for, and scope of the proposed report.

                                 2.      It is expected that RAP 2014 will inform the change management process and
                                 implementation of the new WBG strategy. Notwithstanding the retrospective nature of
                                 evaluation evidence, RAP 2014 will align its analysis and findings with the WBG’s evolving
                                 organizational structure and identify lessons for the WBG strategy implementation to the
                                 extent possible. Taking account of feedback from the Board and Management, RAP 2014
                                 will adopt a significantly more focused and streamlined approach in assessing WBG

                                 performance, and in tackling this year's special theme, “Achieving the Millennium
                                 Development Goals (MDGs) – the WBG’s Contributions”.

                                 Context

                                 3.      Since July 2013, the WBG has initiated a process of transformation. A new WBG
                                 strategy was adopted which set two ambitious goals: (i) end extreme poverty by 2030; and
                                 (ii) promote shared prosperity. Globally, there is high level recognition of the need to go
                                 beyond the MDGs in order to achieve the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030, now
                                 a central theme in the development agenda. In particular, there is broad agreement that the
                                 post-2015 development agenda should place sustainable development at its core and that a
                                 set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) should be developed through a Member State-
                                 led process with broad participation from external stakeholders such as civil society
                                 organizations, the private sector and businesses, academia and scientists.
                                                                                 June 27, 2014
Rationale and Objectives

4.       Independent evaluations can provide insight into what has worked and how existing
approaches can be modified to meet new contingencies. The main objectives of RAP 2014
are to: (i) review how the WBG has responded to the MDG agenda at the strategic,
organizational and operational levels, and identify lessons for the post-2015 work; (ii) report
on the results and performance of the WBG’s activities as captured in recent evaluations and
analysis; and (iii) distill lessons from evaluations to support efforts to enhance the WBG’s
effectiveness. The report will also identify knowledge gaps that may be addressed by future
evaluation with a view to enhancing learning.

Scope and Key Questions

5.      RAP 2014 will have two distinct but interrelated parts. Part I will focus on this year’s
special theme, “Achieving the MDGs – the WBG’s Contribution” and will draw lessons for
the future, especially in relation to the organization’s pursuit of the twin goals. It will
compile evaluation evidence on how the WBG engaged with the MDGs to generate lessons
that will be helpful for future engagement in the post-2015 agenda. In particular, it will
examine process-related issues to address the following key questions:

      How have the MDGs influenced WBG activities and decisions at the corporate,
       institutional, sector and country levels?
      What lessons can be drawn for WBG engagement post-2015?

6.      OED’s 2002 Annual Review of Development Effectiveness (ARDE): Achieving
Development Outcomes – the Millennium Challenge, which used the then recently adopted
MDGs as its main organizing theme, concluded that the Bank's country, sector and global
programs were broadly consistent with the MDGs. It also identified key challenges including
the need for: greater levels of cooperation and collaboration with partners; better defined
objectives and targets reflecting MDG priorities; enhanced prioritization of specific sectors,
subsectors, regions, or population groups; and the need to identify how cross-sectoral
complementarities can be effectively exploited in order to design and implement outcome-
oriented strategies. In addressing the key question for Part I, RAP 2014 will take up and
explore how the organization has responded to these and related issues in the intervening
period.

7.      Part II of RAP 2014 will focus on recent trends in the results and performance of the
WBG and will seek to shed new light on the factors influencing the WBG’s effectiveness in
delivering results in responding to the following key questions:

      How effective have the WBG’s interventions been in delivering development results?
      What are the key factors affecting the WBG’s performance?
                                                                            June 27, 2014
       What lessons can be drawn for implementation of the WBG strategy and reforms?

8.      RAP 2014 will report on and analyze outcome ratings from IEG reviews of the
WBG’s self-assessments of its country strategies and financing interventions (including IFC
advisory services and MIGA guarantees) to gauge project and program performance. The
analysis will be organized in line with the new Global Practice (GP) groups to facilitate
identification of trends and challenges specific to each GP group.2 One of the salient
findings of RAP 2012 and RAP 2013 was the declining performance for WBG investment
financing in recent years. To shed more light on key factors affecting the outcomes of WBG
interventions, RAP 2014 will delve deeper into selected issues raised by previous RAPs and
synthesize IEG’s findings from recent evaluations, learning products, and other relevant
materials. Other influencing factors such as the WBG management’s response to IEG
recommendations as tracked via the Management Action Record will also be analyzed.

Approach and Methodology

9.      RAP 2014 will follow a similar mixed approach and methodology used in previous
RAPs. It will analyze data from a variety of different sources, synthesize learning from
recent evaluations, and seek inputs from WBG management and staff, especially on MDG-
related issues. Given limited time and resources, RAP 2014 will not attempt to generate a
significant amount of fresh data or new evaluative evidence. Where knowledge gaps exist,
RAP 2014 will candidly note deficiencies, and suggest issues for future study.3

10.     Part I of RAP 2014 will document how the WBG has engaged with the MDGs at
corporate/institutional level, at sector level, and at country program level. It will examine the
influence of the MDGs on WBG policies and its organizational alignment over time through
a review of corporate/institutional strategic and policy documents, and through interviews
with relevant staff. This would include an analysis of the influence of the MDG agenda on
the WBG’s overall resource allocation and the trajectory of commitments across sectors. The
report will also delve into projects to analyze the extent to which the MDGs are reflected in
WBG project design and objectives.




2Since 2011, the RAP series has grouped WBG interventions into four areas (expanding economic
opportunities, building infrastructure for growth, enhancing human development, and ensuring
environmentally and socially sustainable development) to facilitate the analysis and presentation of
sectoral and thematic results. RAP 2014 analysis will reflect the new GP approach, but for
comparability purposes, a summary analysis based on the four categories will be prepared and
appended to the report.
3An IEG-wide meta-evaluation is on-going and will review the nature and process of the RAP
product.
                                                                                   June 27, 2014
11.     To achieve a greater level of granularity in the exploration of the influence of the
MDGs on the WBG, RAP 2014 will develop and examine two sets of illustrative examples at
sector and country levels. First, it will look into how the WBG responded to the challenges
in education, health, and environment (access to safe water and sanitation) sectors, where
relatively good data exist. Through a review of WBG sector strategies, sector programs,
delivery models, sector-specific partnerships, and relevant IEG evaluations and reviews, as
well as interviews with relevant staff, RAP 2014 will trace: (i) how WBG sector strategies
have evolved over time to reflect the MDG agenda; (ii) how sector programs were adapted to
delivering relevant outcomes; (iii) how the WBG interacted with global/regional/bilateral
partnerships in support of the achievement of relevant MDGs; and (iv) what mechanisms
were set up to ensure sustainability of the gains achieved in the sector.

12.     Second, RAP 2014 will draw from recent IEG thematic and country program
evaluations to examine how: (i) WBG country strategies evolved over time; (ii) WBG
operational programs were adapted in pursuit of relevant development outcomes; (iii) the
WBG engaged with partners to help client countries achieve the MDGs; and (iv) mechanisms
were set up to ensure sustainability of the development gains. Two countries each from
Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS), Low Income Countries (non-FCS), and Middle
Income Countries groups will be selected from the pool of countries that have been subject to
a recent IEG Country Program Evaluation with a view to understanding the impact of the
MDG agenda on WBG country engagement. Where relevant, RAP 2014 will take into
consideration the extent to which the WBG used its influence as part of the PRSP process
and debt relief efforts to direct domestic expenditures towards MDG related areas.

13.     It is noted that the MDG’s orientation of state-to-state partnerships between high-
income and low-income governments has precluded a clearly defined role for many players,
including those in the private sector. As such, the approach and methods set out above refer
mainly to the World Bank, but will be applied to IFC and MIGA where relevant. The role of
the private sector has now been recognized in the post-2015 SDG agenda; IFC and MIGA’s
responses to both the MDGs and the post-2015 process will be examined in this context.

14.      Part II of RAP 2014 will build on the analysis of previous RAPs and explore some of
the factors that affect the WBG’s operational effectiveness. Focusing on the KPIs of the
WBG Corporate Scorecard that explain organizational effectiveness, the trends in the WBG’s
operational and organizational performance will be examined in tandem and their
relationship will be explored to understand how organizational effectiveness affects results.
With specific reference to determinants of lending performance, lessons from IEG Project
Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) and validations of IFC and MIGA projects over
the last five years will be codified and analyzed systematically. The findings will be cross-
referenced with Implementation Completion Reports to confirm the prevalence and
seriousness of the issues, as well as the soundness of the lessons. It may well be that more
                                                                                  June 27, 2014
in-depth analysis is required to get to the bottom of the driver of performance issue; if so,
IEG will also carry out a separate study in FY15 that will build on previous OPCS and IEG
work and delve deeper into the determinants of WBG performance.

15.    Following the practice in RAP2013, the regional updates will be presented in an
online Annex to the RAP2014.

Work Plan and Timeline

16.     Under the direction and guidance of Nick York and Geeta Batra, RAP 2014 will be
prepared by a core team including Xiaolun Sun (Task Team Leader), Sidney Edelmann, Xue
Li, Eduardo Fernandez Maldonado, Albert Martinez, Carla Lizette Pazce, Swizen Rubbani,
Luis Alvaro Sanchez, Zhan Shi, and Anthony Tyrrell. Carla Fabiola Chacaltana will provide
administrative support. The team will seek inputs from other IEG staff and consultants
across the VPU on specific aspects of the report preparation and dissemination.

17.   The peer reviewers for RAP 2014 will include Homi Kharas, Michael Klein, and
Kalpana Kochhar (TBC). Consultations with relevant WBG management and staff will be
conducted following the usual practice for IEG’s large-scale evaluations.

18.     The RAP 2014 report will be prepared with an estimated budget of $675,000 (TBC),
of which 15 percent will be spent in FY14, 65 percent on fixed costs, and $40,000 on
dissemination. An additional $75,000 will be budgeted for the regional updates. The report
will be finalized and presented to the Board in the third quarter of FY15.
