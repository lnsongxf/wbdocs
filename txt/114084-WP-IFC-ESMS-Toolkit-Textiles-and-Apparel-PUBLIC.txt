Welcome & How to Use This ESMS
Toolkit and Case Studies
                              Environmental and social responsibility is becoming more and
                              more important in today’s global economy. There are thousands
                              of environmental and social codes and standards in the world
                              today. The codes and standards define the rules and the
                              objectives. But the challenge is in the implementation. An
                              environmental and social management system helps companies
                              to integrate the rules and objectives into core business
                              operations, through a set of clearly defined, repeatable
                              processes.

                              In the following pages, we provide tools to build or enhance your
                              environmental and social management system (ESMS). Section I is
                              the Toolkit – sample documents, blank forms, flowcharts,
                              checklists and templates. There are tools for each of the nine
                              elements in your ESMS. Section II is the Case Studies – examples
                              of how two different companies used the tools and developed
                              and implemented an ESMS appropriate to the size and nature of
                              their business.

                              As you go through the Toolkit and Case Studies, you may want to
                              refer back to the companion publication, the ESMS
                              Implementation Handbook, which gives more background on
                              each of the nine ESMS elements.

                              It is important to remember that simply creating a book of
                              policies and procedures is not the end - just the beginning. They
                              need to be implemented and turned into consistent processes.
                              Continual improvement requires people that are committed to
                              the effort. It requires trained people that have the right attitude,
                              skills and knowledge. It requires leadership. Our hope is that,
                              with this in mind, a company can use our ESMS tools to help
                              accelerate the journey of continual improvement, for its own
                              benefit and that of its employees and stakeholders.

 Policies
 Introduction

                               Policies are the foundation of your Environmental and Social
                               Management System (ESMS). They are the rules that you expect
                               your people to follow and the public statement you make about
                               what your company believes in and how you strive to conduct
                               your business.

                               The process of adopting environmental and social policies
                               provides a company with an opportunity to think about and
                               discuss what is important. Ultimately, it also enables you to gain
                               the commitment and support of senior management as they
                               approve and communicate the policies.

Sample CEO Letter announcing the ESMS - Internal
To all employees of our company:
Our vision for our company is to become one of the most respected and admired textiles and apparel
companies in our area. We aspire to conduct ourselves in an ethical and responsible manner. Corporate
social responsibility, which spans environmental, human rights, labor and social issues, is a growing concern
to investors, brands and retailers, consumers and to all of us as people.
To integrate corporate social responsibility into our day-to-day business activities, we are developing and
implementing an environmental and social management system (ESMS). A management system is trained,
committed people routinely following procedures and continually improving.
I ask for your full cooperation in this important initiative. We believe that corporate social responsibility
must be a foundation of our long-term growth and profitability. Not only is it an integral part of our overall
business strategy, but it is also the right thing to do. It is the right thing for our customers, our suppliers, our
shareholders, our communities and for you, as a core part of this company.
As we strive to successfully implement our ESMS, we will train and involve you throughout the process.
[Person’s name and title] is in charge of this corporate social responsibility initiative. Each of you has a
direct line of communication with [person] for any suggestions or concerns. I thank you for your efforts and
your continued dedication to our success.

Identification of Risks and Impacts
Introduction

                              Identifying your risks can seem like a daunting task, but don’t be
                              overwhelmed. Scale your program as appropriate for the size and
                              complexity of your company. But remember, small companies
                              can have the same risks and potentially severe environmental and
                              social impacts as large companies.

                              Think of your risk identification and assessment as a value-added
                              activity, an opportunity to gather information that will help to
                              effectively improve your operations. Risk identification and
                              assessment is an ongoing process; situations change over time, so
                              the assessment should be repeated at regular intervals.

                              When identifying your risks, be mindful of the different risks that
                              may be faced by women and men. Also, consider the risks to
                              people outside your company – your external stakeholders.

         2. Identification of Risks and Impacts

Process Mapping Tool
Instructions:
A process map or flowchart visually describes the flow of activities of a process, from beginning to end. Below
is an example of a blank process map.
Please look at the case study for company ABC, a denim mill in China in Section II of this Toolkit, to see how
this map can be completed and followed through.
Process maps are particularly useful in identifying environmental risks, occupational health and safety
hazards and areas for process improvement. They are also helpful to identify whether you can improve the
work flow, which can benefit the workers.
After you write down your process map, look at each activity and think of:
     •    the occupational health and safety hazards;
     •    the environmental and community risks; and
     •    the opportunities for waste reduction and energy savings.
It is very important that people at all levels in your company participate in the identification of risks,
opportunities and possible solutions. Supervisors and workers are a valuable resource in helping you learn
about the way things actually work on the production floor. . If you can’t have all the necessary people in a
room, you can ask supervisors consult with the workers in their area and provide you with information about
the activities they oversee.
After you have identified the risks and opportunities for each step, you can think of the possible solutions.
Solutions can range from installing fire escape routes and ensuring that they are always unobstructed and
unlocked, to revising your workflow procedures to better control risks; from phasing out the use of
dangerous machineries or processes, to improving the use of personal protective equipment by your
workers and the safe storage, use and disposal of hazardous chemicals. These solutions will form the basis
of the Action Plan you will prepare in the Management Programs chapter.

Physical Mapping Tool
Instruction
Prepare a map of the layout of your facility. The map should include entrances and exits, loading stations,
parking lots, staircases and elevators, toilets, first aid offices, sick bays, canteen and laboratories, cutting,
sewing and dyeing machinery, boilers and tanks, storage sites for dyes and chemicals, security guard posts,
packaging depots, and waste disposal systems. You can also use this map again later when you do your
emergency preparedness plan. Once you have the physical map, do a walk-through to observe existing or
potential problems. Whenever you encounter a problem, write it down and mark it on the map (see
example for case study XYZ, a T-shirt producer in Bulgaria in Section II of this Toolkit). The walk-through
should be conducted during working hours and during all shifts, with a team that includes supervisors and
workers, since they often know what the problems are and have ideas about necessary improvements.
You may want to conduct a similar walk-through of your major suppliers and sub-contractors.

                                                HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO LOOK FOR:

     •    Where and how are people most likely to become injured (e.g. from falls, cuts, strains, etc.)?
          Identify trip, slip and fall hazards and injury from vehicles and chemical spillages.
     •    Are there sufficient exit doors that are unobstructed, well-marked and unlocked? Are they
          equipped with panic bars that allow escape from within but deny access from outside?
     •    Are any passages blocked due to layout or improperly stored materials?
     •    Are there evacuation plans posted on the walls?
     •    Are the toilets clean?
     •    Is the facility laid out efficiently to reduce ergonomic strain?
     •    Where could the accidental release of hazardous materials occur? Is there adequate and
          appropriate response equipment close to those areas?
     •    Are chemicals labeled and safely used and stored? What is the likelihood and consequence of an
          accidental spillage?
     •    Are there existing or potential leakages from gaskets and drums?
     •    Where does there seem to be high levels of water consumption or discharge? Identify all water
          outlets, hoses, etc. and flag those without spring closures.
     •    Where is most of the waste produced and what is done with it?
     •    Are raw materials being used most efficiently? Where are materials being wasted?
     •    Where are workers exposed to hazardous chemicals, excessive dust, and extreme high
          temperatures? Do workers have appropriate personal protective equipment? Are they using it
          correctly?
     •    What is the condition of the electrical wiring in the facility? Is it exposed to water or dust?
     •    What machinery or processes should the company phase out in order to reduce chances of
          accidents or diseases (e.g. sand blasting)?
     •    In general, are there places or work processes where it is clear there are bad habits?



After the walk-through, meet with the team and discuss what has been observed. Also, talk about previous
incidents or accidents that have occurred in the plant and what have been their consequences.
The information you collect in the walk-through will form the basis of the action plans you will prepare for
your management program (see Chapter 3 Management Programs – Toolkit).

Risk Assessment Form
Instructions
It might not be feasible or practical to address every risk. Where it is necessary to prioritize your actions, try
to avoid or minimize the most potentially severe risks.
Complete this form based on the risks that you identified using the previous tools. Identify the probability
that a certain risk will occur, and the potential severity of the impacts. For example, an explosion may be
unlikely to occur (low probability), but the damage to your people and facility could be extremely high (high
impact).
As you prioritize issues to be addressed, consider opportunities for cost savings through reduced water and
energy consumption, reduced waste generation and similar considerations.

 Introduction

                               A management program is centered on the action plans and
                               improved procedures to help you to avoid, minimize or
                               compensate for the risks and impacts you’ve identified.

                               We present three tools related to this element:

Action Plan Chart
Instructions
Use the Action Plan Chart to identify the actions you will take concerning the risks and how the actions will be managed. List each risk that you identified and
prioritized in the previous section. Write down the actions that you could take to avoid, minimize or compensate/offset the risk. Assign a responsible party and a
deadline. Identify the resources required and the operational procedures you will need to adopt.

Outline of Procedure
As you implement the Action Plan, it is helpful to define procedures that clearly systematize the actions into
routine, daily processes and practices. Procedures can be text, flowcharts or pictograms – whatever you find
to be the most effective communication tool for your company. Below is an outline of the important
components of a well-defined procedure.

                              A well-implemented ESMS is ultimately about trained, committed
                              people. Senior management commitment is critical, but beyond
                              that you need people throughout the company who take
                              responsibility for the ESMS. This does not mean that the ESMS
                              becomes everyone’s full-time job. You should scale the system to
                              meet your company’s size and structure.

                              Remember that there needs to be a progression from awareness
                              to commitment to implementation. Think about this as you plan
                              the relevant training. For each training module, think about
                              whether the goal is to raise awareness, gain commitment or give
                              people the knowledge and skills they need to implement.

                              We present two tools related to this element:

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Introduction

                              Even with good systems in place, emergencies can and do
                              happen. The key is to plan in advance – try to prevent as much as
                              you can, and train your employees so they know what to do in
                              case something does happen. Don’t be overwhelmed by the
                              thought of planning for every single possible accident or
                              emergency. Look at your risk assessment and focus on the areas
                              where emergencies are most likely to happen or would cause
                              significant harm. Develop and implement a suitable “emergency
                              preparedness and management plan” for the identified
                              emergency situation.

                              As part of the plan, you need to have detailed procedures on the
                              steps to prepare and respond to an emergency. Here we provide
                              samples of procedures for responding to two of the most
                              common emergencies in the textiles and apparel industry – fire
                              and chemical spills.

                              Fires happen often in the industry due to loose materials, such as
                              fabric off-cuts and deposits of fluff and dust, which can easily
                              burn when they get hot, for example, if they are near a light
                              fittings. Other causes of fires can be bad electricical wiring, short
                              circuits and problems with machinery (boilers and generators).

                              Spills of hazardous substances or chemicals like formaldehyde or
                              ammonia can have small and large negative impacts on the health

                              of workers and the environment. Most factories and workers do
                              not know what to do when spills occur. A relatively simple
                              procedure can help you prepare for these situations and save
                              lives.

         5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

          e.         The person discovering the fire should notify the telephone operator, giving exact location
                     and nature of fire.
          f.         The telephone operator will notify the following in turn:
                i.          engineering control room;
                ii.         time office;
                iii.        operations manager;
                iv.         maintenance department;
                v.          safety manager/fire safety officer;
                vi.         all other heads of departments; and
                vii.        house doctor.
          g.         The telephone operator will remain on duty as an information and control center unless
                     instructions or condition dictate otherwise.
          h.         As soon as the electrical department is notified, the electrician shall cut off the power
                     supply of the affected area, bring the elevators (if available) down to the ground level and
                     provide an adequate lighting arrangement (with emergency lighting if extra light is
                     required) for firefighting or evacuation.
          i.         The maintenance department or the plumber shall reach the fire hydrant pump room (if
                     safe) for smooth pump operation.
          j.         The emergency controller (operations manager or the shift in-charge) will make
                     appropriate decisions regarding building evacuation and firefighting with the help of an
                     internal trained team and/or notifying the city’s fire department.
     4.2. BUILDING EVACUATION: It is essential to make decisions quickly and evacuate the premises
            in order to prevent the loss of lives. The evacuation procedure should be handled with
            expertise and without delay. When evacuation from the building is necessary, everyone must
            leave through the nearest exit or as advised. The textiles and apparel sector is a labor intensive
            industry, so many people will have to be evacuated in a very short time. In the past, many
            workers in the textile industry have lost their lives due to blocked or locked exists, or an
            insufficient number of exits. Make sure exit routes can be used in case of an emergency.
          a.         Close but do not lock doors behind you as you leave the building
          b.         Employees and visitors are to gather near the designated muster point in a safe area that is
                     upwind from smoke or toxic gases and will not hamper emergency vehicles or services
                     when they arrive.
          c.         A head count must be done to ensure that everyone (employees and visitors) is accounted
                     for.
          d.         Employees are not to re-enter the evacuated building until they are so advised by the
                     designated officer (operations manager or safety manager).

          e.      In case a rescue operation for a trapped employee/visitor is required, it must be
                  performed by trained and competent personnel equipped with suitable PPEs.

     4.3. MEDICAL AID: Treat all minor injuries with first aid, but remember that first aid is only
            temporary. First aid provides the immediate treatment that is needed before a doctor can
            reach the victim onsite, or before the victim can be transported to a doctor. What you do in the
            critical moments after an injury occurs could save a life, so it is important to know the basic
            first aid procedures. Review them often so you will be prepared if you suddenly find yourself
            in an emergency situation. The most important thing to do when someone is injured is to
            survey the scene to determine if the situation is safe, or if the victim must be moved from a
            dangerous location to a safe place. Call for emergency medical help immediately for all life-
            threatening situations and send people to guide the emergency team to the victim.
     4.4. FIRST AID FOR FIRE INJURIES AND BURNS
          a.      Move patient to fresh air.
          b.      Move the patient from the heat of fire.
          c.      Do not allow crowding around the patient.
          d.      Remove or cut away clothes from affected parts of the body.
          e.      Open buttons and loosen clothing.
          f.      Pour chilled water on the affected parts.
          g.      Apply any antiseptic cream.
          h.      Get a doctor.
     4.5. ASPHYXIA: If the patient has difficulty breathing or there are symptoms of collapse:
          a.      Give artificial respiration with respirator or mouth-to-mouth respiration.
          b.      Give oxygen.
          c.      Take the patient to the hospital or medical help.
     4.6. SHOCK: If the patient perspires, has a low pulse and the body is cold:
          a.      Cover with a blanket. (Do not touch burned parts.)
          b.      Keep the victim lying down.
          c.      Elevate feet if you do not suspect head or neck injury or leg fracture.
          d.      Get medical help.
          e.      Monitor vital signs.
          f.      Prevent loss of body temperature.
          g.      Take the patient to a hospital immediately.
5.0 Emergency Response Team: The purpose of the Emergency Response Team is to deal with
     catastrophic accidents within the company. The team’s responsibilities are to immediately meet
     when an emergency situation is reported and to determine the course of action.

Sample Chemical Spill Response Procedure

Title: Chemical Spill Response Procedure
Procedure number: EM002
Number of pages: 3 pages


1.0 Purpose and Scope:
     1.1. Purpose: This procedure outlines the steps to manage a chemical spill in order to minimize the
            potential for injury and damage to the environment.
     1.2. 1.2. Scope: The procedure applies to any event resulting in the uncontained spill of a
            hazardous substance within the activities and processes of [Name of Company].
2.0 Definitions:
     2.1. Nature of the Spill: Determined by the level of risk from the hazardous substance and the
            level of containment of the spill. One can distinguish between minor and major spills
     2.2. Minor Spill: Limited risk to workers and environment. An example of a minor spill is a spill of
            5 ml of concentrated Sulfuric Acid, which is a small volume that can easily be neutralized and
            removed.
     2.3. Major Spill: Large risk to workers and environment. An example of a major spill is the
            uncontrolled release of ammonia in an unventilated enclosed area. If the volume is large it may
            represent a high risk to persons in the area.
3.0 Responsibility and Authority: This procedure is the responsibility of the operations manager or
     designate. The operations manager shall report to the president in matters related to emergency
     preparedness, and shall have total authority during emergency situations. The operations manager
     shall have the authority to declare a state of emergency. In the absence of the operations manager,
     these authorities shall revert to the president.

     4.1. MINOR SPILL

          a.      Spills must be cleaned up promptly and thoroughly.
          b.      Approach with care - many harmful chemicals lack colour or offensive odours. Never
                  assume that spilled chemicals are harmless.
          c.      Identify the chemical/s and hazards involved – check Material Safety Data sheet (MSDS) or
                  International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC).
          d.      Use the information on the physical and chemical properties of the material to judge
                  response and/or evacuation procedures.
          e.      Decontaminate equipment, clothing and personnel, including any victims, on site if
                  necessary.

          f.         Dispose of contaminated equipment and materials only after receiving specialist advice.
          g.         Ensure emergency procedures are in place and practiced.
     4.2. MAJOR SPILL:
          a.         Contact operations manager and lab manager.
          b.         Notify the telephone operator, who will remain on duty as information and control center
                     unless instructions or condition dictate otherwise.
          c.         The telephone operator will contact public authorities when appropriate. Provide the
                     following information:
                i.        State that this is an emergency.
                ii.       Give your name, telephone number and location.
                iii.       Give the location of the incident.
                iv.        Provide the time and type of incident.
                v.         Provide the name and quantity of material involved.
                vi.        Note the extent of injuries, if any.
          d.         Evacuate personnel from the spill area.
          e.         Shut off equipment as you leave the area.
          f.         Direct personnel to the nearest fire exit. Do not use elevators.
          g.         Do not touch any harmful substance. Take precautions to protect yourself if necessary.
          h.         DO NOT go back in to an area where a chemical spill has occurred! Untrained rescuers not
                     wearing proper protective equipment can be overcome by toxic or asphyxiating fumes.
                     Contact Operations manager and Lab Manager.
          i.         Close doors to prevent further contamination. Secure the area to keep non-emergency
                     response personnel away from danger.
          j.         Isolate contaminated individuals and treat as per MSDS or ICSC.
          k.         In conjunction with expert assistance, minimise the spread of contamination and
                     commence decontamination/clean up procedures.

     4.3. MEDICAL AID: Treat all minor injuries with first aid, but remember that first aid is only
            temporary. First aid provides the immediate treatment that is needed before a doctor can
            reach the victim onsite, or before the victim can be transported to a doctor. What you do in the
            critical moments after an injury occurs could save a life, so it is important to know the basic
            first aid procedures. Review them often so you will be prepared if you suddenly find yourself
            in an emergency situation. Follow the instruction on MSDS sheets or ICSC cards.
          a.         Remove victims from spill area to fresh air (but do not endanger your own life by entering
                     areas with toxic gases).
          b.         Immediately remove contaminated clothing.
          c.         Flush skin or eyes with running water for 15 minutes.

Stakeholder Engagement
Introduction

                              Your company interacts with many different groups of
                              stakeholders. A stakeholder is any person or organization that
                              has an interest in or is affected (or perceives to be affected) by
                              your company. Engaging with stakeholders will help you
                              understand how to avoid or minimize any negative impact and
                              reduce the risks to your business from anti-company sentiments
                              and negative campaigns that could affect your company’s
                              reputation.

                              We present three tools related to this element:

                                      •    Stakeholder Mapping Tool

Stakeholder Mapping Tool – Identification and analysis
Instructions
Ensure you have a cross-functional/departmental team to start the exercise.
List relevant stakeholders for your company (e.g., those directly and indirectly affected by your
company, those that have an interest in your company operations, those that have an ongoing
relationship with the company, and those that have the ability to influence your company operations).
Provide as much detail as possible (i.e. name your main suppliers independently; disaggregate
communities by identifying local leaders or other relevant actors).
Next to each stakeholder group, discuss and list their key concerns, issues, interests.

                        STAKEHOLDER                                      ISSUES/CONCERNS/INTERESTS




Place these stakeholders on the stakeholder map according to the degree to which they are impacted by
your operations and their capacity to influence your company operations.

5. Classify stakeholders according to their current relationship with the company: supportive,
   supportive with conditions, neutral, negative. The purpose of stakeholder engagement is to
   keep supportive stakeholders happy and help address the concerns of less-supportive stakeholders.
   Remember that stakeholders’ relationships with the company may change over time. We
   recommend that you analyze their current position to the company.

6. Identify the groups that represent a high priority for engagement.

7. Define strategies to engage with the prioritized stakeholders. When defining engagement
   strategies, keep in mind current initiatives of the company. Engagement strategies should be
   differentiated, based on where stakeholders are located on the map:
     •    Quadrant 1: Involve them as needed
     •    Quadrant 2: Proactively approach and support them
     •    Quadrant 3: Keep them informed
     •    Quadrant 4: Respond to their concerns
8. Review the stakeholder map at regular intervals and when there are major changes. It is advisable
   to review the stakeholder map with external groups to get their feedback.

Impact Zoning Tool for Identifying Affected Communities
Instructions
The term “affected communities” includes any individuals or communities that are located in proximity to
the company’s facilities and are directly exposed to actual or potential adverse impacts on their
environment, health and livelihood due to company activities.
A quick and practical technique for identifying affected communities is the “impact zoning map” (see box
below). By mapping the sphere of influence of different types of environmental and social impacts, the
company can begin to identify distinct groups by impact area, and can then prioritize the stakeholders for
consultation.
While priority should be given to individuals and groups who are directly and adversely affected, drawing a
line between who is affected and who is not can be challenging. Communities lying just outside of the
designated impact area can perceive impacts or feel they have been arbitrarily excluded from the
engagement process.


                                HOW TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH IMPACT ZONING
               1.   Draw a sketch map of the key design components of the project, both on- and off-site, that
                    may give rise to local environmental and social impacts (e.g. the project site; ancillary
                    infrastructure such as roads, power lines and canals; sources of air, water and land pollution).
                    This may be performed more efficiently by using aerial photographs or satellite images.
               2.   Identify the broad impact zones for each of these components (e.g. the area of land take, air
                    and water pollution receptors, etc.).
               3.   After identifying and mapping broad stakeholder groups, overlay those groups with the impact
                    zones.
               4.   Through consultation with relevant stakeholder representatives, verify which groups are
                    potentially affected by which impacts.

Stakeholder Engagement Plan Worksheet
Instructions
After the identification of your most important stakeholders, the next step is to develop a plan for how to
engage with the groups that you listed. Engagement should be stronger and more frequent with those
groups that are most affected and those that have a greater ability to influence your business.
At a minimum, you should always implement an external communication procedure to receive
communications from the public and accordingly adjust your management program. In the presence of
adversely affected stakeholders, you should implement a grievance mechanism and actively engage them in
consultation, regularly disclosing clear and meaningful information and providing communities with
opportunities to express their concerns and suggestions. Finally, you should report back to them on the
actions your company has put in place to address the issues identified during the process of consultation.
The table below provides example of some stakeholders that may be associated with your operations. Once
you have done the stakeholder mapping and identified their concerns, you may start looking at the other
necessary information, such as: engagement method, information to be disclosed or reported back to your
stakeholders and the key information you would like to obtain.

External Communication and Grievance
Mechanism
Introduction
                              Grievance Mechanism

                              The purpose of a Grievance Mechanism is to establish a way for
                              an individual or a group within communities affected by your
                              business to contact you if they have an inquiry, a concern or a
                              formal complaint. It provides people with an alternative way of
                              communicating with your company as part of your formal
                              stakeholder engagement process.
                              External Communication

                              Even if affected communities per se are not identified, you should
                              always establish and maintain a publicly available and easily
                              accessible channel for the public to contact you (e.g., phone
                              number, website, email address, etc.). External stakeholders can
                              provide valuable information such as suggestions on product
                              improvement, feedback on customers’ interaction with your
                              employees and comments from regulators, NGOs and individuals
                              regarding your company’s environmental and social performance.

Introduction

                              Affected stakeholders will want to know what actions your

                              communicating with them. Keeping them informed of what you
                              are doing is the final critical piece in building and maintaining a
                              good relationship.

Monitoring and Management Review
Introduction

                              Monitoring and review are critical because this is how you check
                              and adjust your ESMS. You need to monitor whether your action
                              plans are being implemented, procedures are followed and
                              whether your ESMS is addressing the relevant risks and providing
                              lasting improvements. The goal of the ESMS is to shift from
                              corrective actions to preventive actions. Monitoring and
                              management review is what gives you the information to do this.

                              We present two tools for this element:

Auditing Guidance
Instructions
Go through all the areas highlighted in the Auditing Guidance – this will help you to get a broad view of all
potential risk areas and elements of the ESMS beyond those that you may have targeted in your initial risk
assessment.

                                                           A. PREPARATION

       Collect audit reports for the facility on environmental performance, labor standards performance and community
       stakeholder engagement, for the previous two years.

       Collect corrective action plans generated from previous audits and review the status of each action item that was
       agreed on from previous reviews. Are they all closed out? Focus the review on open items and the underlying
       reason(s) for incomplete status, and ensure that the audit considers the underlying issues for the upcoming audit.
       Focus should be on the underlying limiting factors that prevent completion.

       Ascertain the general level of PPE use on the farm/plantation. Ensure that auditors wear the same PPE as employees
       are required to wear: head, hearing, eye, skin protection, protective boots, clothing, etc. Do not allow any auditor to
       enter work areas without the clothing/gear required for the operations activity and that employees are required to
       wear.

       Obtain facility floor plans designating work areas, break areas, activities underway, flow of materials, clean areas, dirty
       areas, location of fire extinguishers, fire exits, emergency lighting and protective covers, security guard posts,
       restrooms, principal water outlets and drains, any non-potable water outlet. Ensure auditing team has a working
       knowledge of the facility/operation to be evaluated.

       Research and refer to current local environmental and labor laws and regulations.
       Basic labor code issues: (i) regular weekly work hours, (ii) labor contract provisions, (iii) rest periods, lunch, etc., (iv)
       overtime requirements, limits and exceptions, (v) hour averaging and banking hours, (vi) minimum wage, (vii) social
       system payment liability, (viii) annual leave, (ix) laws to protect disadvantaged workers, (x) severance pay.
       Basic environmental code issues: (i) wastewater, (ii) storm water, (iii) spill prevention and response, (iv)
       construction/demolition/remodeling, (v) hazardous materials, (vi) hazardous waste, (vii) toxic chemical release, (viii) air
       emissions, (ix) solid waste.

       Review regulatory permit(s) conditions and specific requirements along with most recent review and corrective action
       reports.

       Review certification(s) audit reports (e.g. BSCI or SA8000) for nonconformance, mandatory remedial actions,
       recommendations, etc. Summarize status of items (open or closed).

       Review any government inspection reports, third-party audit reports, etc.


       Review the stakeholder engagement plan and records of grievances by external stakeholders. Pay attention to:
       emergency preparedness and response capability to include the community if necessary; use of chemicals and
       accidental releases of hazardous materials affecting community, e.g. dyes and chlorine; discharges of wastewater or
       other wastes to areas affecting local communities; exacerbation of flooding; limits of water availability use and physical
       access; diminution of quality of life due to the operation.

       Pay special attention in observation/document review/interviews to issues identified in previous reports.


       Research and understand the national and local context of labor union rights and activity, local environmental groups
       and community activist organizations.

       Schedule sufficient time to conduct the scope of the audit. Announce the availability of confidential meeting schedules
       with employees; schedule, arrange and conduct while protecting employee confidentiality.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

                                            B. INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT

       Meet with the senior management and department managers before conducting audit activities to review ESMS issues
       and the purpose of the audit.

       Share an agenda for the meeting and itinerary with senior management and department managers.


       With department managers, review the prior audit reports and performance to date in meeting corrective actions.


       Discuss non-retaliation against cooperating workers; inform management that future audits will include reviews of the
       continued employment of workers interviewed.




                                                        C. OPERATIONAL WALK-THROUGH
       Conduct operational walk-through following the flow of production from receipt of raw materials to packaging and
       shipment of finished goods. Refer to previous relevant physical walk-through assessments of the facility; determine if
       all previous nonconformance/action items are closed out; if not, why not?

       Minimize the number of managers that accompany you on the walk-through. One or two escorts based on
       knowledge/responsibilities are usually sufficient.

       During the walk-through, be aware of your body language and the message this sends to workers; ensure that you are
       equipped with/wearing the same PPE required of employees.

       Take note of all things observed that require attention:
           1. Water used indiscriminately for watering as well as washing and cleaning;
           2. Water wastages/inefficiencies
           3. Energy wastage;
           4. Evidence of spillages;
           5. Dry cleanup and collection of organic solids;
           6. Harborage or other unorganized storage of materials;
           7. Wastes and discards;
           8. Workplace availability of data on hazards or banned or restricted chemicals in use (MSDS/ICSC);
           9. Movement of materials: hand trucks, forklifts, etc. Are the passageways and transit routes clearly marked; is
                color-coding used for non-pedestrian movement?;
           10. Obvious hazards for heads, hearing, sight, life and limb: workplace hazards attenuated; employee
                awareness?;
           11. PPE used as prescribed, available, replaced at no cost; employee awareness;
           12. Are employees able to explain jobs and responsibilities?; and
           13. Evidence of QA team activity.

       Verify that fire exits exist and open on demand; no means to prevent exit; panic bars in good working order; clear
       egress once exit opened; emergency exits clearly marked; nearest exits clearly marked; hose cabinets equipped with
       hoses, nozzles, etc.; prohibited areas clearly marked; electrical cabinets closed and sealed; lockout tag out procedures
       and tools (tags, locks, warning labels and signs) clearly available near electrical cabinets; first aid cabinets and
       equipment; emergency lighting; emergency preparedness and evacuation plans in place; employees trained.

       Work conditions should be verified for adequacy if there is potential for risks such as heat, light, noise and dust. Use
       measuring devices to determine air quality, noise level, temperature and adequate lighting. (This is a useful/easy thing
       to do). For dusty operations or potentially dusty areas, LEL (lower explosive limit) meters and alarms should be
       installed.

       Following the facility walk-through conduct a walk-through of the dormitory facilities, canteens, washrooms, changing
       rooms if relevant. Ask to use the toilet; be shown where and how to access for both men/women. Ask for a drink of
       water. Note the condition and adequacy of these areas.




IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Textiles & Apparel             Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                                 62
         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Suggest best practice to supervisors and managers during the walk-through; ensure that the suggestion is filtered by
       processes/operations practicalities.

       Give sufficient attention to all ESMS elements during the operation/dormitory walk-through. Knowledge of
       procedures, training using the procedures, awareness of complaints management and resolution procedure,
       employment rights, HR policy and provisions, etc.

       Identify all incidences of non-conformance with ESMS issues, both major and minor.


       Pay special attention to areas identified in previous corrective action requests. Focus on open non-conformances from
       previous audits: why did they occur? Elucidate the underlying cause and make an effort to diagnose and prescribe
       preventive and ameliorative measures. The individual who is responsible for the item is not as important as why it
       occurred and how the company can prevent non-conformances and unplanned events in the future.




                                                        D. INTERVIEWING WORKERS
       Select at least 5 percent of workers, max. 100 workers. Conduct individual and group interviews for balanced
       response.

       Select workers who are representative of the workforce population (gender, race, age, religion, functional
       departments, etc.).

       If the factory has contracted or migrant workers, make sure to include them as well.


       Do not allow supervisors or managers to influence selection of workers for interviews or the interviews.


       Conduct on-site interviews in areas that protect worker confidentiality and where the worker would feel comfortable.
       Make sure supervisors or managers are not in or near the space where the interviews are conducted. Keep them away
       from the selection and interview process.

       Conduct interviews early in the audit to allow for follow-up.


       Make sure to tell the workers that everything they say is confidential and that management has been warned against
       retaliation.

       Be sensitive to cultural and gender issues.


       Plan for an average of fifteen minutes per interview; however, use common sense in terminating interviews that are
       becoming nonproductive and extending interviews with people who are candid or openly addressing critical issues.

       Formulate questions prior to the interviews to make sure you cover all specific areas of the ESMS review through the
       aggregated interviews. Always ask employees how processes may be improved, water use reduced, energy saved,
       waste reduced, etc.

       If you plan to take notes, ask the workers if it is OK and clearly explain reason for taking notes. Try to minimize note
       taking as much as possible during the interview. Finish writing your notes immediately after the interview, so you have
       accurate documentation.

       Have your worker representatives recommend a preferred approach to building rapport with workers.


       Ask workers specifically about follow up on previous corrective action plans. What non-conformances remain open;
       what issues presented through the complaints management and resolution mechanism remain open?

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       Make sure your questions address the following:
       LABOR ISSUES
              Do workers know about and understand your policies related to labor and working conditions?
              Do workers understand their rights under the law related to freedom of association and collective
                 bargaining?
              Do workers understand how their wages are calculated, for base time, performance and overtime?
              Are workers aware of any dismissal, transfer, demotion or other punitive action against workers due to their
                 exercising their rights under either their contracts or local or national law?
              Ask workers about the status of trade unions, worker committees or other worker groups in the factory and
                 whether there is management interference.
              Ask questions to determine conformance to discrimination and sexual harassment policies.
              Do workers understand the company’s grievance mechanism, and do they feel it is operational and free from
                 retaliation?
       OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES
              Do workers feel safe and protected in their jobs? For example, are they provided with PPE that is appropriate
                 and works? Is their physical environment free of hazards? Are they expected to reduce physical hazards or
                 are engineering controls in place? Are there job hazards assessments done routinely and when the processes
                 or materials change? Have issues submitted through the complaints management and resolution mechanism
                 been addressed?
              Do they feel there is adequate safety equipment, such as extinguishers/hydrants and first aid kits? Are there
                 sufficient safety drills if an emergency, such as a typhoon, flood or wind storm, were to occur and necessitate
                 an evacuation from buildings? Witness the emergency mock drills and make note of shortcomings; ask an
                 employee to pretend he/she has just been injured and explain what to do next.
              Are they instructed and trained on these risks at regular intervals?
              Have any workers been involved in accidents at the facility and, if so, what happened afterwards?
              Is the environment comfortable to work in, in terms of ventilation, adequate illumination for the task at hand
                 temperature, noise and dust levels
              Do they feel that chemicals, waste and other substances are stored or disposed of safely and appropriately at
                 the facility? Is there sufficient access to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and/or International Chemical
                 Safety Cards (ICSCs) and appropriate training in their use? What is the management’s response to any
                 expressed issues through the complaint management and resolution mechanism?
       If the organization employs contract workers, make sure to ask questions that address possible violations and areas of
       abuse. Do you feel different from a permanent employee? Why?
       Conduct some worker interviews off-site if possible.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

                               E. INTERVIEWING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
       The stakeholder mapping exercises and stakeholder consultation meetings should help identify the relevant population
       that is affected by the facility and its activities.

       Select a sample of individuals that represent the views of this affected community. This group may include members
       of the public as well as NGOs, campaign groups, trade unions, local businesses and government authorities. If possible,
       target NGOs that are industry-specific. Seek out former employees if possible, but filter out disgruntled former
       employees or those with a personal agenda against the company.

       Gauge awareness of the grievance mechanism. Has it been tested? Does it work? Does the company utilize it in
       practice or ignore it? Is it taken seriously?

       Be sure to include representatives from indigenous or marginalized groups in these interviews.


       Make sure your questions address the following:
           How have the facility's operations affected the physical environment (air, water, land) near them?
           Has this resulted in either air, land or water contamination?
           Has wildlife been affected by the facility's activities?
           Has the facility's business impacted local livelihoods, access, traditional
               hunting/fishing/breeding/religious/other grounds due to natural habitat conversion?
           Have any health risks or deterioration to well-being been associated with the facility from exposure to toxic
               chemicals, from air emissions or noise pollution? Note any neighbors or employees with sick children or
               significant notable abortion rates.
           Have any contagious illnesses been on the rise due to an influx of workers to the facility?
           Have these affected groups had any clashes with security hired at the facility?
           Have any of these groups been approached or invited by the company running the facility to discuss their
               concerns at meetings or had any of their grievances addressed and investigated or had any follow up to their
               questions?



                                                        F. ON-SITE DOCUMENT REVIEW
       LABOR ISSUES:

       Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
       1. Human resources: Management-worker committee meeting minutes, memos and letters, budgets related to
       implementing labor policy, training material, logs and curricula or written communications to workers that address all
       issues, training records and instructor qualifications.
       2. Working conditions: Contracts for all workers; policies and procedures related to wages, benefits, hours and leave;
       evidence of communication and training on wage calculation; personnel files; time cards; payroll records and pay stubs
       (selected without management interference); criteria used to set performance pay bonuses; and employment and
       termination records.
       3. Are employee payment methods secure? Are employees able to have payments deposited into an account? Are
       they paid in cash at the facility (which can lead to significant risks during the trip home)?
       4. Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining policy, agreement and documentation (such as minutes and records of
       collective bargaining sessions).
       5. Discrimination: Discrimination policy; related procedures; documentation handling discrimination issues; diversity
       training and attendance log; hiring, promotion and termination records; gender demographics in facility at worker and
       manager levels.
       6. Retrenchment: Policies and procedures for workforce reduction, severance and transition; documentation of prior
       workforce reductions; minutes of management meetings and communications to workers on this issue.
       7. Complaint management and resolution mechanism: Documented procedure, communications, records and logs of
       grievance handling.
       8. Child labor: Procedure for age verification, documentation of apprentice program, birth and medical records and
       school records of workers.
       9. Forced labor: Employment contracts (as well as for those workers hired through recruitment agencies), payroll
       records, timesheets and wage deduction, worker passports and IDs.

         9. Monitoring and Management Review

       10. Health and safety: Accident and medical treatment logs, equipment safety logs, logs of fire and safety drills, health
       and safety risk analyses, government health inspection reports, safety certificates and training curriculum and logs, and
       evidence of changes to all of this when company processes, methods, chemicals or materials are changed, reordered,
       etc.

       Select files and/or records at random to generate a representative sample of the workforce population and functional
       distribution in the factory. Seek some files to corroborate interviews conducted earlier.

       Balance your time and effort investigating all areas of labor standards at work. Document review is particularly critical
       for wages, working hours, health and safety, use of sub-contractors, hiring and termination.

       If the operation employs contract workers, address potential areas of abuse in the document review. Specifically
       review the contract with the workers.

       Identify all significant incidences of non-conformance in preparation for your management meeting.


       ENVIRONMENTAL AND OSH ISSUES:

       Make sure you review the relevant documents for the following areas:
       1. Emergency response and preparedness: Examine the facility's emergency response procedures and accident
       reports, as well as documents indicating that workers have been trained on these issues.
       Ask the employee to show you how to get out, assuming that there is now a fire; follow the employee; ask another to
       tell/show you what happens if he/she was just injured.
       2. Environmental management: Examine any company environmental policies and environmental management
       system policies and reports, including sustainability reports, energy consumption records, guidelines and monitoring,
       resource use and waste generation. Note the status of previously identified non-conformances.
       3. Insurance: Identify documents that indicate legal permits have been obtained, insurance policies are in place and
       the relevant legal authorities notified of the facility's activities.
       4. Technical: Documents on production processes, and storage, purchase and maintenance of facility equipment.
       Availability of MSDS/ICSCs and employee training and orientation to the specific risk posed by materials in use;
       response to submissions through the complaint management and resolution mechanism.
       5. Waste disposal: Policies, procedures and guidelines on elimination and recycling of waste emissions and effluents to
       air, water and land, including monitoring of the quantity and quality, treatment and disposal of all waste, including
       wastewater and solid waste; are employees/area supervisors queried for opinions on improvements?
       6. Hazardous material: The storage of chemicals and toxicology sheets (MSDS/ICSCs from ILO/WHO/EU/UNEP, etc.).
       Avoid total reliance upon manufacturer's statements. Does procurement mandate furnishing such materials?
       7. Health and safety: Check for the existence of logs of accident and fatality rates, health and safety guidelines or
       handbooks for workers and monitoring of these statistics, including the job hazard analyses and engineering
       corrections to eliminate hazards at the source, as opposed to requiring employees to mitigate environmental hazards;
       provision of appropriate PPE that cover actual, defined technical, physical, biological and chemical hazards in the
       workplace; Tool Box safety meetings records.
       8. Work environment: Look for guidelines, reports, logs and "ecomaps" of the facility work environment that monitor
       emissions of dust, odors, sources of noise and vibrations and worker exposure to heat and cold. LEL meters and
       audible and visual alarms are mandatory wherever there may be accumulations of dust or ambient dust.
       9. Suppliers and sub-contractors: Ask for a list of sub-contractors. Ask for ESMS reports related to suppliers and
       subcontractors.




IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Textiles & Apparel           Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                                    66
         9. Monitoring and Management Review

                                                            G. SUPPLIERS
       Supply chain map: Make sure that the facility has mapped and identified suppliers, subcontractors and homeworkers
       used.

       Risk assessment: Check the existence of a risk assessment procedure for the main suppliers or groups of suppliers in
       order to identify the key risks these suppliers face.

       Policy: Check for well-defined labor, OHS, environmental and community policies for suppliers based on national law,
       outcomes of the risk assessment and your requirements.

       Binding Contracts: Check whether the facility includes its policies in contractual arrangements with suppliers.


       Ensure that the facility´s labor, OHS, environmental and community policies are understood and implemented by
       suppliers through:
                Active communication of policies to suppliers.
                Periodic monitoring and auditing of suppliers.
                Follow-up on corrective actions as a result of monitoring and auditing.
                Training and capacity building programs of suppliers related to the management systems on labor, OHS,
                 environment and community issues.
                Job descriptions and evaluation criteria implemented by the procurement department of the facility.
                Evaluation/selection criteria of existing and new suppliers. Do they include labor, OHS, environmental and
                 community criteria?
                Making it possible for suppliers to meet labor and OHS policies by agreeing on reasonable prices, lead times

ABC Case Study

ABC Textiles and Apparel, China
ABC Textiles and Apparel Company (ABC), established in 1972, is a medium-sized family owned business
based in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China. It is a denim mill that dyes, weaves and finishes denim
fabrics. Current annual production is about 5 million meters of high quality denim fabric. The company buys
un-dyed yarns from Chinese, Turkish and Indian spinners. ABC sells the denim fabric that is produced to
domestic and foreign clients. Most of its domestic clients are sewing factories based in Guangdong Province.
These sewing factories then deliver to up-market domestic and foreign brands. The factory is located in a
large industrial area with dozens of other textile companies. The factory operations are separated into three
different buildings: the dyeing operations are in one building; the weaving and finishing operations are in the
second building; and the warehouse, dormitory and canteen are in the third building. The premises are
surrounded by a fence and guarded in order to make sure no valuable material is lost.
The factory is managed by three brothers who took over from their father five years ago. One brother is
responsible for sales; the other is responsible for production; and the third oversees finances and human
resources. ABC currently has 450 employees. The factory runs on two shifts. All workers are required to
work mandatory overtime. Workers who refuse overtime are penalized by the management. Workers are
not paid any overtime premium rates. About 25% of the workers are from Dongguan and the remaining
75% are from the Eastern and Northern regions of China. The factory closes or runs at low capacity during
Chinese New Year, when most workers from other regions return to their families. The factory withholds
wages around the New Year to make sure workers return after their leave. Most employees tend to return
after Chinese New Year, but increasing numbers are not returning. As a result, the annual staff turnover rate
has increased to 41%. The factory has been raising wages over the past few years due to higher minimum
wages stipulated by the government and in an effort to reduce the turnover of staff. The factory needs
experienced staff in order to maintain its current quality level. The majority of the workers on the factory are
female workers who complain about verbal harassment from middle management and sexual harassment
from the male guards of the factory, who tend to frisk them when leaving the factory.
The factory has also started an apprentice program for young workers. This program was created in order to
offset the increased costs of paying higher wages to older workers, and to make sure that the company has a
sufficient base of workers in the future. A local blogger has recently accused the management of allowing
children (below the legal minimum age of 16 years) into the apprentice program and forcing young
workers to work overtime and night shifts. The blog was recently picked up by a local NGO who contacted
ABC’s clients. Since the blog put their reputation on the line, ABC´s clients demanded a quick and thorough
response. ABC’s lack of response would have resulted in direct termination of the business relationships. The
clients also performed audits of the company to address issues around the apprentice program and found
non-compliances related to wages and overtime as well. This has increased tensions between ABC and its
clients. A major client is very close to terminating the relationship.
ABC’s other major concern is the environmental criteria stipulated by brands and the government. The
factory uses vast amounts of water to process and dye yarns and fabrics. It also uses large amounts of
energy to heat the water. The factory was, until recently, able to keep up with local law and brands’
requirements by sending the effluents to the municipal wastewater treatment plant. However, that is no
longer sufficient. Surrounding communities and the local authorities have become increasingly aware of
the negative effects of the textile industry due to the large amounts of water consumed and
corresponding amounts of wastewater. As a result, water prices have been raised over the years and
wastewater outflow parameters issued in terms of pH, BOD5, COD, and metals have become more
demanding. Enforcement of those parameters is also becoming stricter. Two brands that use ABC fabrics in
their products were identified as the main contributors to pollution in China in a recent report. As a result,
brands have started to tighten their policies. Brands are also increasing their restrictions or bans on the use

of certain chemicals. The brothers are not sure how to deal with these issues. They are not sure how to save
water and additional wastewater treatment is costly. They are also not sure how to control the banned and
restricted substances in the dyes and auxiliaries they buy from specialized large companies. They are also
afraid that the quality, look and feel of their denims will change if they start changing processes and recipes.
Despite these issues, ABC’s profit and revenue have risen steadily. However, the brothers are worried about
the near future. They struggle with the attitude of their workers and clients. They feel that the new
generation of workers is complaining about everything: work pressure, management style, the food, the
dormitory, noise and dust levels. Clients are also becoming more and more demanding about social and
environmental issues, but also claim that they are unable to pay more. On top of these challenges, NGOs and
local communities have also started to interfere with the company’s internal processes.
In order to get a better understanding of the social and environmental processes and to be able to handle all
these new requirements, the management has decided to set up an Environmental and Social Management
System (ESMS).

ABC TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Policy Statement
Under pressure from its clients, personnel and the community, ABC has decided to adopt policies for the
environment and on labor and working conditions. Management realizes it will be very hard to meet these
requirements, given the current conditions and operational procedures of the factory. Nevertheless, the

ABC TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Complaint Management and Resolution
Procedure
In order to receive and handle forced overtime and other complaints, ABC developed the following
Complaint Management Resolution Procedure.



Title: Complaint Management and Resolution (Internal Grievance Procedure)
Procedure number: HR003
Number of pages: 2

1.0 Purpose and Scope:
    1.1. Purpose: Establish a transparent process for workers to express concerns and file complaints,
         including anonymous complaints. Ensure there is no retaliation or discrimination against
         those that express concerns or file complaints. Ensure good worker-manager communications
         to enable workers to raise concerns before they become serious grievances.
    1.2. Scope: Any complaint or dispute that may arise from a worker or worker organization.

            All individual complaints shall be initiated at Step 1 and shall, if necessary, proceed step by step
            to Step 5 where the resolution proposed shall be final and binding. Collective complaints and
            disputes will be handled in the same step-by-step approach as that for individual complaints,
            but shall begin at Step 2.

            Issues will inevitably arise from time to time, but since disputes are potentially harmful to the
            company, its workers, supervisors and managers at every level, all parties will be expected to
            resolve all but the most complex difficulties without recourse to Step 5 of this procedure.

            The worker organization filing the complaint or representing the worker filing the complaint
            shall have the right to be notified and be present at all steps of the procedure.

            Every effort should be made to settle the issue at each step and until this procedure has been
            completed there shall be no threats of “go-slows,” partial or general stoppages of work or other
            illegal action or lock-out.

2.0 Definitions:
    2.1 Grievance: Specific violation or feeling of having been wronged – the reason for filing a
    complaint.
    2.1 Complaint: The formal communication of a grievance to the appropriate parties.

3.0 Responsibilities:
    HR Department

4.0 Work Instructions:
    Step 1:
    4.1. The worker presents the complaint or grievance verbally to the most immediate supervisor,
         who has the authority to make adjustments in the matter, within 14 days. Explanations of
         responses to complaints, even if only to alert workers to a delay in the process, are key to
         ensuring workers understand their complaints are respected and taken seriously.
    4.2. The supervisor records the complaint or grievance and the action taken in the complaints log.

ABC 3. Management Programs

     Step 2:
     4.3. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1 within three days, or if the worker fears
          making the complaint directly to the most immediate supervisor, then a worker representative
          may present the complaint verbally to the supervisor concerned. The worker may choose to
          remain anonymous.
     Step 3:
     4.4. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 2 within three days following its completion,
          the worker or his or her chosen representative for the case may present the complaint to the
          department head. The complaint shall be in writing and shall state the complainant(s) or
          grievant(s) name(s).
     Step 4:
     4.5. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 3 within five days of the date of submission of
          the written complaint or grievance to the department head, the worker or his or her chosen
          representative for the case may present the complaint or grievance to the head of the Human
          Resources Department.
     4.6. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall schedule a meeting to
          be held within fourteen days of the receipt of the complaint or grievance with the worker or his
          or her chosen representative, for the purpose of attempting to resolve the complaint or
          grievance.
     4.7. The worker can bring one or two peers for support during this meeting; those workers will also
          be covered under the non-reprisal clause.
     4.8. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall respond in writing
          within seven days of the date of the meeting.
     Step 5:
     4.9. If the complaint or grievance is not resolved at Step 4, and it is clear that resolution within the
          company is impossible, the worker or his or her chosen representative may refer the complaint
          or grievance to the Labor Ministry for resolution.
     Monitoring:
     4.10. The Human Resources Department will conduct a quarterly review of all complaints and
            actions taken. It will review the complaint logs of each supervisor and department head to
            evaluate the effectiveness of the grievance procedure and resolutions.
     4.11. As part of the quarterly review, the Human Resources Department will follow up directly with
            the worker or his or her chosen representative to make sure there has been no retaliation.
     4.12. The Human Resources Department will maintain a central record of all complaints and
            resolutions.

ABC 5. Emergency Preparedness and Response

In addition, ABC developed an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan to identify, prevent and respond
to emergencies based on the risk assessment, which identified unsafe use and storage of hazardous
substances as a severe-impact risk (Risk 1). The plan included a Chemical Spill Response Procedure.

ABC 6. Stakeholder Engagement

ABC TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – identification and
analysis
An ABC cross-departmental team brainstormed and listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an
interest in the company’s operations. The team then discussed and listed their key concerns, issues and
interests. To identify those, they looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts
previously identified (see Chapter 2. Identification of Risks and Impacts – ABC Case Study) and how these
affect the surrounding communities.


                         STAKEHOLDER                                        ISSUES/CONCERNS/INTERESTS
    a. Local NGO                               Concern about labor issues, especially child labor and abuse of young workers.
                                               NGO has reached out to key clients to express their concerns and increase pressure on ABC.

    b. Communities close to or                 Neighboring communities are increasingly concerned about the negative impact of ABC on
       affected by the factory                 the environment due to high use of water, along with noticeable depletion of ground
                                               water, and contamination of water bodies due to use of hazardous substances.

    c. Customers (brands and                   Non-compliances with codes of conduct.
       retailers)                              Legal non-compliances.

       authorities                             Environmental damage to ecosystems, agriculture, fisheries and human health risks due to
                                               overuse and contamination of water.
                                               The local government increasingly penalizes non-complaint companies, and has closed
                                               polluting factories.
                                               Water prices have been raised in order to stimulate reduction in use.



Then, ABC mapped the stakeholders on a matrix according to (i) the degree to which they are impacted and
(ii) their ability to influence the company operations. Finally, ABC categorized them based on their current
relationship with the company: supportive, supportive with conditions, neutral, opposed. Based on this,
they defined their engagement method with each group.

XYZ Case Study

XYZ Textiles and Apparel, Greece-Bulgaria
XYZ Textiles and Apparel Company (XYZ Company) was established in 1992. The company is based in
Thessaloniki, Greece and Petrich, Bulgaria. The company manufactures T-shirts, sweatshirts, skirts and
dresses. The office in Thessaloniki employs 15 people who are responsible for sales, administration, quality
control, packing and shipping. Production takes place just across the border in Bulgaria. The owner of XYZ
Company decided to move production from Greece to Bulgaria in 2002 due to difficulties competing with
low cost countries like Turkey and countries in Asia.
In Bulgaria, the owner controls a factory which produces 1 million garments per year. The factory employs
50 permanent workers and an additional 20 to 50 workers in peak periods. Management positions in the
factory are held by men. The rest of the workforce mainly consists of local Bulgarian women. The factory
cuts, sews and irons garments according to client specifications. The factory also operates rotating printing
machines, which allow the factory to quickly apply prints on the chests or hems of T-shirts and other items.
The factory is known for its ability to quickly process products. The owner is proud of his ability to deliver the
product within 4 weeks of order confirmation from the client. Speed and flexibility are necessary to remain
in business in the face of competition from cheaper suppliers in Asia. The factory operates two shifts: a 6am
to 2pm shift and a 2pm to 10pm shift. Extra workers are hired for a short period of time during peak
production periods. These workers are paid each week in cash. Permanent workers also work extra hours
when needed. In order to avoid penalties or air shipments that can apply when lead times are not met,
workers work double shifts in some cases. While the older women who work in the factory are satisfied
with the current set-up of the factory, the young and ambitious female workers are getting frustrated with
the fact that is impossible for them to grow or be promoted in the factory. No training is provided to female
workers, and promotion to middle or top level management is impossible. They also feel that it is unfair
that the few men who work in the factory get higher salaries for the same work. As a result, the most
talented and hard-working young female workers leave when they get the chance. They move to bigger
cities or to factories that provide further opportunities. The factory has, so far, been able to hire new
workers due to high unemployment in the region. However, the costs associated with hiring and training
new workers are high. The inexperienced workers also have higher product defect rates and lower
productivity rates.
The factory subcontracts embroidery and clothing decorations to Greek and Bulgarian knitters who live
near the factory and work from their homes, in order to accommodate short lead times. These knitters
work under significant pressure since they must meet a minimum quota to be paid their weekly wages. If
they do not meet the quota, they must work overtime to finish the work. They are not compensated at a
premium rate for this extra time. Many workers feel the quota is hard to meet but they need the money and
so they are willing to forego toilet and rest breaks in order to meet it.
While management is strict on product quality, they tend to be more flexible on other issues. Workers can
decide for themselves whether to use protective equipment (e.g. gloves in the cutting department and
needle guards). A number of workers have sustained injuries, such as puncture wounds to their fingers,
because the protective equipment is uncomfortable to wear and slows their production rate. Maintenance
on electrical wiring and other machinery is also not a priority for management.
The factory is located in the middle of a small city. The summers are hot, and the winters are cold. The
factory is surrounded by small houses for local families and a small number of industrial buildings. The
factory building is old. Routing of production lines is inefficient and working conditions are poor. So far, the
owner has postponed investments in insulation and ventilation, extra toilets and improved lighting .
Workers have been complaining about the heat and lack of toilets. The people living close to the factory
complain about the traffic late and early in the day, as well as the noise from the machines. A couple of
weeks ago there was a fire in the factory due to an electrical short circuit. Two workers were injured while
IFC ESMS Toolkit and Case Studies – Textiles & Apparel   Version 1.1 September 12, 2014                        113
XYZ Case Study

fighting the fire since they were not sure how to handle and use the fire extinguishers available. The fire has
increased tensions among the workers and the community. They fear that a fire can happen again. An action
committee formed by workers and community members asked the management to take action but
management did not respond. As a result, the action committee informed the local authorities about the
bad and unsafe situation in the factory. The local authorities informed management that they will inspect
the factory within the next four weeks.
The situation in the factory is also reflected in the increasing number of social and environment audits
requested by key clients. The audit results were not positive. The reports pointed out several serious non-
conformances related to the working conditions in the factory. Two major clients have also sent “restricted
substances” lists (RSL) to be signed. The clients started to demand test reports per fabric and color to prove
that chemicals on the restricted substances lists are not used or do not exceed defined limits. Clients also
announced they will put more emphasis in future audits on the use, handling and storage of chemicals used
in the printing department of the factory.
The owner is not confident that the factory will be able to pass these audits and meet requirements of his
clients in the near future. He is afraid he might lose business as a result. He is aware that XYZ Company lacks
the knowledge and policies to manage social and environmental issues, and he wants to get control of these
issues. In order to make sure that he can satisfy workers, clients and community, the owner of XYZ Company
has decided to develop and implement an environmental and social management system.

XYZ 1. Policy

XYZ TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Policy Statement
Under pressure from its clients, personnel and the community, XYZ decided to adopt policies for the
environment and on labor and working conditions. Management realizes it will be very hard to meet these
requirements, given the current conditions and operational procedures of the factory. Nevertheless, the
company has decided to proceed with a complete set of policies because it is afraid of losing major
customers. Management established a three-year plan to try to achieve compliance with the policies and
gain some type of international certification or recognition.
Besides the complete set of policies, management prepared a shorter version summarizing the most
relevant points:
XYZ - Our products, our environment, our people
Together we produce quick response, fashionable, quality, garments that create value and confidence for
our customers.
We are committed to conducting our operations in accordance with the environmental and labor laws and
regulations that apply to our industry.
We strive for a safe and injury-free workplace, ensuring that our workers are not exposed to dangerous
situations or hazardous chemicals, and that they use the appropriate personal protective equipment.
We treat men and women equally in our company, which is reflected in equal pay for equal work and the
ability to grow and develop for all.
We are open to dialogue with the wider community around our factory. We are open to their concerns and
will address them when possible.
We feel that our responsibility for good environmental and labor conditions also applies to our suppliers. We
monitor and facilitate their ability to live up to our commitment.
We are all - managers, workers, clients, suppliers and community – jointly responsible for making our policy
a reality.

XYZ TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Water Conservation Flowchart
In order to receive and handle discrimination and other complaints, XYZ also started to develop a Complaint
Management Resolution Procedure. Here we present the adopted policy. You can apply a similar procedure
to your facility. KEEP IN MIND: It is also important to check whether your suppliers, sub-suppliers and
subcontractors have an effective complaint management procedure. If they do not have such a procedure or
it still under development, it is important to make your complaints procedure known and accessible to
workers and other stakeholders of your contractors and suppliers. It creates a safety net for the workers
involved, for you and your clients. It allows you to identify and solve issues before they escalate into a gross
negative impact which is time and money consuming and can ruin your and your clients’ reputation.

XYZ Complaint Management and Resolution (Internal Grievance Procedure)
Responsible Party: Senior Management
Date Issued: March 15, 2013
Procedure number: HR003
Number of pages: 2


1.0 Purpose and Scope:
     1.1. Purpose: Establish a transparent process for workers to express concerns and file complaints,
            including anonymous complaints. Ensure there is no retaliation or discrimination against
            those that express concerns or file complaints. Ensure good worker-manager communications
            to enable workers to raise concerns before they become serious grievances.
     1.2. Scope: Any complaint or dispute that may arise from a worker or worker organization.


            All individual complaints shall be initiated at Step 1 and shall, if necessary, proceed step by step
            to Step 5 where the resolution proposed shall be final and binding. Collective complaints and
            disputes will be handled in the same step-by-step approach as that for individual complaints,
            but shall begin at Step 2.


            Issues will inevitably arise from time to time, but since disputes are potentially harmful to the
            company, its workers, supervisors and managers at every level, all parties will be expected to
            resolve all but the most complex difficulties without recourse to Step 5 of this procedure.


            The worker organization filing the complaint or representing the worker filing the complaint
            shall have the right to be notified and be present at all steps of the procedure.


            Every effort should be made to settle the issue at each step and until this procedure has been
            completed there shall be no threats of “go-slows,” partial or general stoppages of work or other
            illegal action or lock-out.

     complaint.
     2.1 Complaint: The formal communication of a grievance to the appropriate parties.
3.0 Responsibilities:
     HR Department
4.0 Work Instructions:
     Step 1:
     4.1. The worker presents the complaint or grievance verbally to the most immediate supervisor,
            who has the authority to make adjustments in the matter, within 14 days. Explanations of
            responses to complaints, even if only to alert workers to a delay in the process, are key to
            ensuring workers understand their complaints are respected and taken seriously.
     4.2. The supervisor records the complaint or grievance and the action taken in the complaints log.
     Step 2:
     4.3. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 1 within three days, or if the worker fears
            making the complaint directly to the most immediate supervisor, then a worker representative
            may present the complaint verbally to the supervisor concerned. The worker may choose to
            remain anonymous.
     Step 3:
     4.4. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 2 within three days following its completion,
            the worker or his or her chosen representative for the case may present the complaint to the
            department head. The complaint shall be in writing and shall state the complainant(s) or
            grievant(s) name(s).
     Step 4:
     4.5. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step 3 within five days of the date of submission of
            the written complaint or grievance to the department head, the worker or his or her chosen
            representative for the case may present the complaint or grievance to the head of the Human
            Resources Department.
     4.6. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall schedule a meeting to
            be held within fourteen days of the receipt of the complaint or grievance with the worker or his
            or her chosen representative, for the purpose of attempting to resolve the complaint or
            grievance.
     4.7. The worker can bring one or two peers for support during this meeting; those workers will also
            be covered under the non-reprisal clause.
     4.8. The head of the Human Resources Department or his/her designee shall respond in writing
            within seven days of the date of the meeting.

XYZ 3. Management Programs

     Step 5:
     4.9. If the complaint or grievance is not resolved at Step 4, and it is clear that resolution within the
            company is impossible, the worker or his or her chosen representative may refer the complaint
            or grievance to the Labor Ministry for resolution.
     Monitoring:
     4.10. The Human Resources Department will conduct a quarterly review of all complaints and
             actions taken. It will review the complaint logs of each supervisor and department head to
             evaluate the effectiveness of the grievance procedure and resolutions.
     4.11. As part of the quarterly review, the Human Resources Department will follow up directly with
             the worker or his or her chosen representative to make sure there has been no retaliation.
     4.12. The Human Resources Department will maintain a central record of all complaints and
             resolutions.

XYZ TEXTILES AND APPAREL COMPANY Stakeholder Mapping – identification and
analysis
An XYZ cross-departmental team brainstormed and listed the stakeholders that are affected by or have an
interest in their operations. The team then discussed and listed their key concerns, issues and interests.
To identify those, they looked back at the environmental and social key risks and impacts previously
identified (see Chapter 2. Identification of Risks and Impacts – ABC Case Study) and how these affect the
surrounding communities.
